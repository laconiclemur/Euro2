<h3 class="section_head"><span class="red">THE REGIONS OF SPAIN</span></h3>
<h4><span class="red">las regiones de España</span></h4>
<p class="running_first">The Spanish countryside is ample and diverse, and its 200,000 square miles (518,000 sq km) range from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea, the Pyrenees mountains to the Sierra Nevada, and dry plateaus to sprawling river deltas. First and foremost, Spanish cuisine is regional, and the cooking of each region directly reflects its landscape.</p>
<p class="running_first">The northwest part of the country—Galicia, Asturias, and Cantabria—is generally green, hilly, and, in some places, mountainous, with an important dairy industry and one of the world’s largest fishing fleets. The rugged, inlet-etched coastline of Galicia offers the country’s finest fish and shellfish (clams, scallops, oysters, spider crabs, prawns) as well as much of its potato crop, while the valleys of Asturias produce celebrated cheeses, ciders, and white beans. Cantabria has its own culinary fame with its seafood canning industry (especially <em>bonito del norte</em> tuna and anchovies) and, in Potes, distillations of <em>orujo</em> (pressings of grape skins like grappa).</p>
<p class="running_first">To the east of this lies the Basque Country, with its exquisite seafood; opulent, almost cultish cooking (exemplified in <em>txokos</em>, men-only gastronomic societies); obsession with salt cod; and <em>pintxos</em>, small and often highly creative tapas mounted on pieces of bread. Farther east are the nourished hills of Navarra, where asparagus and <em>piquillo</em> peppers grow, and mountain-river trout are cooked wrapped in slices of dry-cured <em>jamón</em>. Sitting snug on the south side of these provinces is the famed wine region of La Rioja, with its simple but flavorful cooking dominated by lamb and red peppers. Indeed, a plate of roasted peppers steeped in garlic-infused olive oil, a slowly roasted leg of suckling lamb, and a full-bodied bottle of Rioja red wine are some of Spain’s unfailing gastronomic pleasures.</p>
<p class="running_first">The Mediterranean coast, with its ancient seaports and wealthy Levantine fields of rice, vegetables, and citrus fruits, offers lively, diverse cooking. The marvelous Catalan and Valencian kitchens mix flavors with baroque abandon—seafood and meat are often found in the same dish; a piece of pork or cuttlefish can add flavor to about any savory dish—yet always strive to highlight the principal ingredients. A night’s ferry ride away are the Balearic Islands, a stunning and rural archipelago that includes, in descending order of size, Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza, and Formentera. Their Mediterranean cuisines are rich in olive oil and herbs, enlivened with a number of unique specialties, including silky fish stews, spiral <em>ensaïmada</em> pastries, cheeses, a spreadable paprika-red pork sausage called <em>sobrassada</em>, and even, on Menorca, gin—a legacy from the centuries when the English fleet harbored in the island’s capital.</p>

<p class="running_first"><a id="page_14"/>The south of the country is dominated by Andalucía; tough, dry, undulating hills—red-soiled, blanketed in olive groves, punctuated by tidy white villages and ancient Phoenician seaports. The base of the cooking here is olive oil, vinegar, and garlic, and incorporates plenty of lamb and pork, game, salt cod, and, along the coast, all manner of delicately fried fish. Tapas are a way of life, and often enjoyed with a local dry sherry. The lingering Moorish influence on the cuisine of Andalucía is clear in such typical dishes as garbanzo beans and spinach with cumin, lamb with honey, and monkfish with saffron, all calling on ingredients introduced during the 800-year-long Moorish reign of the region. (Its iconic gazpachos and <em>salmorejos</em>—thickened with bread in the purée—came later, incorporating tomatoes and peppers from the New World into already existing cool “soups.”) As well, dishes here tend to have more spices—not that they are spicy, as in hot—than elsewhere in the country, and the tradition of sweets is particularly pronounced. For <em>dulces</em>, Andalusian chefs still use a base of sugar, eggs, lemon, and almonds to create countless delicacies.</p>
<p class="running_first">To the northeast of Andalucía is Murcia, split between the glittering Mediterranean sea, with its delicious seafood dishes (gilt-head bream baked in a salt crust is a specialty) and the rural, often isolated mountain interior, where lamb dominates. To the northwest of Andalucía, landlocked on the inside of Portugal, is Extremadura, with its ancient monasteries, vast pastures of holm oak trees (<em>dehesas</em>) where black-footed pigs eat fallen acorns and wild grasses, and rustic, serious cooking. The valley of La Vera, where red peppers from America were first cultivated, dried, and ground into powder for cooking, produces the finest <em>pimentón</em> (smoked paprika), one of Spanish cooking’s most important spices.</p>
<p class="running_first">At the center is the vast central plateau known as <em>la meseta</em>, the dominating geographical feature of the Iberian peninsula, occupying nearly half of its land. Ringed with a turret of mountains, and commanding respect (or at least awe) in its vastness, it is a place of extremes—scorching summers, freezing winters, wind, and little rain. It is pale, austere, more pastoral than agricultural. Here, a windmill turns, sheep graze lazily in the sight of a shepherd, and, in the distance, a church steeple rises above a dun-colored village built around the ruins of an ancient crusader castle: the land of El Greco and Cervantes, saffron fields and honeybee hives, partridge hunts, <em>migas</em> (a dish made with breadcrumbs), <em>sopa de ajo</em> (garlic and bread soup), and aged Manchego cheeses. This is rural Spain at its purest.</p>
<p class="running_first">In the dead middle of it all like a bull’s-eye is the country’s capital, Madrid. Urban and highly cosmopolitan, sure, but still dominated by the tastes of the countryside that is never far away.</p>
