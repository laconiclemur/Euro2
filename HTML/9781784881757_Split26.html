<h1 class="chapter">chillies</h1>
<p class="tx1">Having written cookbooks for years I have now realised it is pointless to state how much fresh chilli to put into a recipe. Long red or green chillies vary so much in heat you cannot tell by looking at them. Therefore, I encourage students in our cookery classes to taste the chilli. The heat is not in the seeds but in the pith, so you need to taste the chilli from around the middle, not at either end where there may be no pith. Only by tasting it will you know how much to add to your dish.</p>
