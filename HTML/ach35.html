<p class="author1"><span class="txit">brodetto di pesce alla marchigiana</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">Our wonderful photographer, Francesco Tonelli, contributed this recipe, which was handed down to him from his mother. It is essentially a “poor man’s” tomato sauce made with onions, garlic, and tomato paste—an excellent base for a variety of lunch dishes. It also makes for a quick, flavorful sauce in the winter, when there are no fresh tomatoes available, and can be made a day ahead of time and then reheated. I like to use an assortment of fish and seafood in this stew, but it may also be prepared using just one type of fish. Select any you like—although I would not recommend oily fish, such as salmon, tuna, or bluefish. Serve it as a main course over boiled rice or pasta or over slices of toasted bread that have been drizzled with olive oil.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup extra virgin olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup finely chopped onions</span></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 cups water</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 pound rockfish, halibut, or striped bass steak, bone in, skin removed, cut into 6 to 8 portions</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> pounds scrod, snapper, or cod fillets, cut into 3-inch chunks</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> pound cleaned calamari, cut into 2-inch chunks</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">6 to 8 jumbo shrimp, shelled and deveined</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 tablespoons torn fresh basil leaves</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Warm the olive oil in a large, wide saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir in the onions, bay leaves, and garlic and cook until the onions soften and are golden yellow, about 8 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and generous grindings of pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, to sweeten the paste with the onions, about 2 minutes. Stir in the water and season the sauce with salt. Bring to a slow simmer over low heat. Cook to thicken and reduce the sauce, about 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_69"/><span class="red">2.</span> Add the rockfish (or other fish), cover the pan, and cook over low heat to soften slightly, about 5 minutes. Add the scrod (or other fish) and the calamari. Do not stir the fish, as it may break. Instead, shake the pan back and forth to incorporate the new fish and coat it with some of the sauce. Cover and cook to soften slightly, about 7 minutes. Add the shrimp, cover, and cook until they just begin to turn pink, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside, allowing the fish to finish cooking off the heat, about 5 minutes more. Season with salt and garnish with the basil leaves. Serve immediately.</p>

Slice the shrimp in half lengthwise. Proceed with the recipe as written, serving the finished, slightly soupier stew in shallow bowls.</p>
