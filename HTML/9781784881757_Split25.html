<p class="tx2"><b>In the Middle Ages salt was only used when absolutely necessary – such as for preserving – as it was very expensive, hence the traditional Tuscan bread has always been made without salt. Part of the expense resulted from a local tax on salt imposed in the 16th century across Tuscany.</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Salt is an essential part of the Tuscan kitchen. Without it your food will never taste authentic. We have measured the salt quantities in some of the recipes when you cannot add salt to taste, for example to a ragù before it is cooked, to a mixture with raw eggs or to a bake. When you can, do keep tasting your food before serving it. This might sound obvious, but you would be amazed by the number of people who don’t, and the end result can be disappointingly bland after all your efforts.</p>
<p class="tx">Adding salt can often make food taste sweeter. For example, adding the right amount of salt to a tomato sauce brings out the natural sweetness of the tomato, avoiding the need to add sugar.</p>
<p class="tx">Tuscan food can often be salty. To address this, if you were a little over generous with the salt, add a peeled small potato to the pot and it will absorb the salt. A squeeze of lemon juice helps, too. An average Italian pinch of salt is approximately 3 g (½ teaspoon).</p>
