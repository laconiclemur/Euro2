<p class="author1"><span class="txit">pesto al basilico</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This is a classic summer pasta dish, which may be served before grilled fish or meats. In Liguria, a northwestern region of Italy, I have had it served over pasta that has been cooked with string beans and thinly sliced half-moons of peeled potatoes. The beans add a crisp texture to the pasta, while the potatoes add creaminess to the sauce. (Add the vegetables to the pasta during the last 5 minutes of cooking.) Sometimes broccoli florets are cooked in the same way. If you like to freeze pesto sauce, I recommend preparing this recipe without the cheese. Freshly grated cheese may then be stirred into the thawed sauce before tossing with pasta.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 cups well-packed fresh basil leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cups well-packed fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup pine nuts</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">6 cloves garlic, peeled</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup very finely grated pecorino Romano cheese</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 teaspoons kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cups extra virgin olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 pound pasta (spaghetti, linguine, or fettuccine)</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Place the basil, parsley, pine nuts, and garlic in a food processor or blender. Process until the basil and parsley are coarsely chopped. Add the Romano, Parmesan, and salt, and process. With the machine running, add the olive oil in a steady stream. Do not overprocess. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Bring a large pot of salted water to a rapid boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, following the package instructions. Drain well and toss with a small amount of the pesto. Distribute evenly among plates and top with additional pesto before serving.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATIONS</span>:</span> If you like a richer sauce, you may add butter to this basic recipe. Just replace <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup of the extra virgin olive oil with softened butter. If the pesto is slightly brown instead of bright green, add a few leaves of fresh spinach and process. This should help restore the color. Also, you may use Parmesan cheese instead of the pecorino Romano called for in this recipe. And coarsely chopped hazelnuts, toasted in an oven at 350° F for 5 minutes, may be used in place of the pine nuts.</p>
