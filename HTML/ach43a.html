<h3 class="h3b"><a id="page_87"/>rosemary focaccia</h3>
<p class="author1"><span class="txit">focaccia al rosmarino</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">During one year in Italy it seems to me that I lived on focaccia. I would buy a piece after school every day. Though mass-produced and sold from a cart, this hearty oiled and salted bread was the perfect treat. This basic recipe can be changed by adding different herbs or toppings, sometimes becoming a meal in itself (see variations, below).</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 package dry yeast</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> teaspoons sugar</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup warm water</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cups all-purpose flour</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cups bread flour</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 teaspoons kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup milk</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">5 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for oiling the bowl</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Leaves from one 5-inch sprig fresh rosemary</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> In a measuring cup, stir the yeast, sugar, and warm water. Set aside for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook, mix the all-purpose and bread flours with 2 teaspoons of the salt. Stir in the yeast mixture. Gradually stir in the milk and 3 tablespoons of the olive oil. Mix at low speed until the dough has come together and is smooth, about 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta">(To mix by hand: Combine the all-purpose flour, bread flour, and 2 teaspoons of the salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center of these dry ingredients and add the yeast mixture. Mix with a fork while adding the milk and 3 tablespoons of the olive oil to form a soft, dry dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and continue mixing it with your hands. Knead until the dough has come together and is smooth, about 8 minutes.)</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Lightly grease a bowl with olive oil. Place the dough in the bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and drape a dish towel over the bowl. Set aside in a warm place and allow to double in size, about 2 hours.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_88"/><span class="red">4.</span> Lightly grease a large baking sheet (about 9 x 15-inch). Gently punch down the dough. Place it on the baking sheet and roll it out to fit evenly on the sheet. Cover with a dish towel and allow the dough to rise for 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> Preheat the oven to 375° F.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">6.</span> Use your fingertips to make random indentations in the dough. Drizzle the top with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Sprinkle with the remaining 2 teaspoons salt and the rosemary leaves. Bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before slicing and serving warm.</p>
