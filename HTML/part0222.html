<h2 class="rec_heading" id="sab0002446"><a id="pg302" class="pcalibre calibre8"></a>GRACIAS</h2>
<p class="toc" id="sab0002447">I could not have written this book without my parents, whose support and love made all the tough moments easier to bear: this book is dedicated to them. I must especially thank my mother, from whom I learned all I know and who made me passionate about cooking. I also thank my brother Pedro and his family (and thanks to him especially for letting us shoot some of the book at his hotel, the Hotel Palacio Muñatones in Muskiz, near my home in Santurtzi).</p>
<p class="toc" id="sab0002448">Many thanks to my beautiful girlfriend, Natalia, who is always beside me, supportive and amazing!</p>
<p class="toc" id="sab0002449">I would like to thank Sam and Eddie Hart, who trusted me to steer the Barrafina ship over the last fourteen years and who have never been afraid to let me experiment. A big thank you to all the team, past and present, at all the branches of Barrafina, who became my second family and made London my home, in particular to Gisela Fernandez for helping me through the process of making this book and being such a good worker and friend; to Diego Garcia who is an exceptional chef and an even better person and who was always there making my job easier; and to Jose Etura, a real partner in crime and always there when I needed him.</p>
<p class="toc" id="sab0002450">Sophie Missing has helped me to write this book: thank you, Sophie, for listening to me and interpreting and then brilliantly writing up my instructions.</p>
<p class="toc" id="sab0002451">Chris Terry, an old friend, has shot the most beautiful photographs and has been a great travel companion. His assistant Danny has been amazing too.</p>
<p class="toc" id="sab0002452"><a id="pg303" class="pcalibre calibre3"></a>At Penguin, John Hamilton has produced a lovely design and Juliet Annan and Anna Steadman have given advice and support. Sarah Fraser, Ellie Smith and James Blackman have worked to produce a lovely book, and Annie Lee has copy-edited it to get rid of my worst mistakes.</p>
<p class="toc" id="sab0002453">Thanks, lastly, to all of our suppliers; without them none of this would be possible – thank you for being there through the good times and the bad. To Brindisa: sixteen years of cooperation, trying to deliver the best-quality products we can find in Spain. To Javier De La Hormaza (Basco Fine Foods): an exceptional person and the best one when you need those products that can only be found in the Basque Country, such as Pimientos de Gernika, Basque Txuleton and Txakoli de Getaria. To Mash: always searching for the best ingredients, always walking the extra mile, always supportive. To Natoora: always helpful and resourceful, beautiful ingredients from great people. Iberflavours: for when you need best-quality ingredients such as Iberian pork meats and milk-fed lamb – call them, you will not be disappointed. Maurice at Le Marché des Chefs: a very close and helpful supplier. They always get everything I need, even the most difficult ingredients. Wright Brothers: the best oysters in the country; amazing to work with them. Channel Fisheries: my choice when I need fish on my menu, and after fourteen years I still love working with them. Don Bocarte, for the best anchovies. Angel at Cinco Jotas, who supply all our jamón. Imanol at El Mandanga restaurant in Santurtzi. Thanks also to Crane Cookware for the loan of the beautiful pots and pans.</p>
