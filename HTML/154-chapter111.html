<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">When the Phoenicians arrived on the Iberian Peninsula in 1100 BCE, they found rabbits so plentiful that, according to <em>El gran diccionario de cocina</em> (The Grand Dictionary of Cooking<em>)</em>, they named the peninsula <em>I-saphan-im</em>, literally “land [or island] of rabbits.” This Punic word morphed into <em>Hispania</em> and eventually <em>España</em>. Rabbit remains abundant and popular. Healthful and mild-tasting, rabbit meat nicely absorbs the flavors of the stewing pot. But it is also exceptional when grilled, especially when marinated in plenty of Mediterranean herbs.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 WHOLE CLEANED RABBITS, ABOUT 2½&gt; POUNDS/1.2 KG EACH, QUARTERED</li>
<li>6 SPRIGS FRESH THYME</li>
<li>6 SPRIGS FRESH ROSEMARY</li>
<li>6 GARLIC CLOVES, GENTLY CRUSHED IN THE PEEL</li>
<li>6 TABLESPOONS EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL, PLUS MORE AS NEEDED</li>
<li>2 FAT GLOBE EGGPLANTS</li>
<li>SALT</li>
<li>4 FAT ZUCCHINI, STEMMED AND WASHED</li>
<li>FRESHLY GROUND BLACK PEPPER</li>
<li>ALLIOLI <a href="239-chapter175.html#page_337">(PAGE 337)</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Trim any excess fat from the rabbit quarters. Put the pieces in a large baking dish. Strip the flowers from one of the thyme sprigs and the needles from one of the rosemary sprigs and sprinkle over the rabbit. Add the remaining sprigs of thyme and rosemary along with the garlic to the dish. Drizzle the 6 tablespoons olive oil over the dish and mix. Cover, refrigerate, and marinate for at least 2 hours, turning the pieces from time to time.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> Wash the eggplants and cut crosswise into ½&gt;-inch-/1.25-cm-thick rounds. Place in a colander, liberally salt, and let them sweat away some of their bitterness for 1 hour. (You will see dark beads of moisture appear.) Rinse well under running water and pat dry with paper towels. Gently squeeze some moisture from the eggplant and pat dry again.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Meanwhile, prepare the grill for medium-high heat. If using charcoal, allow the embers to burn down until surrounded by a layer of grayish white ash. Rake into an even layer. Brush the grill grate with olive oil.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Wash the zucchini. If they are fat, cut crosswise into ¾-inch-/2-cm-thick rounds (slightly thicker than the eggplant); if they are skinny, cut them lengthwise in half. Season with salt. Brush the eggplant and zucchini rounds with olive oil and arrange on the grill grate (or in a perforated grill pan), grilling for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until charred in places. Transfer as done to a platter. Loosely cover with foil tented in the middle until ready to serve. This will keep them warm while not steaming them.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Remove the rabbit from the marinade, generously season with salt and pepper, and arrange on the grill grate. Grill, turning from time to time, until cooked through and the internal temperature of a thigh is 160°F/71°C, 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the heat of the grill. Do not overcook.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">6.</span> Serve the rabbit with the grilled vegetables and the allioli on the side.</p>
