<p class="author1"><span class="txit">cantucci toscani</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Gianni created this variation on the classic Italian cookie. “I wanted to produce a cookie with a wonderful anise-nut flavor,” says Gianni, “and with a less tooth-breaking bite than I usually found when I sampled biscotti at American bars and cafes.”</p>
<p class="indentb">As my mother suggests in her recipe for biscotti, these cookies are delicious served with red wine. Sauternes, Moscato, and Vin Santo are all very good dessert wines that pair well with biscotti—which are also very good to eat in the morning with coffee!</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cups all-purpose flour</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> teaspoons baking powder</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> teaspoon kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup (1 stick) butter, softened</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cups sugar</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 large eggs</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 large egg yolks</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup honey</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> teaspoon pure vanilla extract</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> teaspoon pure almond extract</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> teaspoon pure anise extract</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup unblanched whole almonds</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> In a medium-size bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> In a large bowl, with an electric mixer on high speed, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add the whole eggs and yolks, one at a time, beating after each addition. Beat in the honey. Add the extracts and mix well. Reduce the speed to low and gradually beat in the dry ingredients. Stir in the almonds, mixing until they are well dispersed.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Turn the dough out onto a sheet of plastic wrap. Form the dough into a ball and flatten it slightly. Wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Preheat the oven to 350° F. Grease two baking sheets or line them with parchment paper, and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_327"/><span class="red">5.</span> Remove the dough from the plastic wrap and divide it in half. On a lightly floured work surface, roll half the dough into a baguette-shaped log about 2 inches wide by 13 inches long, and transfer it to one of the prepared baking sheets. Repeat with the other half of the dough, transferring it to the other prepared baking sheet. Bake until firm and golden, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">6.</span> Reduce the oven temperature to 250° F.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">7.</span> Transfer the cooled logs to a cutting board. Using a serrated knife, slice each log on the bias at <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>-inch intervals. Place the slices on the baking sheet, cut side down. Bake until dry and lightly browned, about 10 minutes on each side. Transfer the biscotti to a wire rack and allow to cool completely. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week.</p>
