<p class="noindenti"><span class="stickup">M</span>any years ago, my sisters and I cooked a surprise meal for our mother’s birthday, the main course being duck that was stuffed with sausages and apples. Though we were not experienced cooks, the meal was a success. That experience made me realize how versatile and relatively simple cooking poultry can be. This is especially true with chicken, which we eat in our house at least three times a week.</p>
<p class="indenti">The following recipes are fairly inexpensive, easy to make, and can help you turn what is rather ordinary meat into something special. My mother also recommends improvising, depending on the ingredients you have on hand, how many people you are serving, the time of year, and personal taste. Start with Gianni’s Chicken on a Brick with Lemon and Rosemary and then try my mother’s <span class="txit">Pollo alla Cacciatora,</span> and you’ll see what I mean.</p>
