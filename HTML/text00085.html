 STICKY STAR ANISE WINGS WITH CHUNKY CHIPS</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_green" id="nad0003536">
<em>I was born and raised in Luton, which is famed for ‘chicken, chips and chilli sauce’. I never ate those (or indeed any kind of takeaway) while growing up, but as soon as I turned 18, I discovered freedom, fear and (my parents’ worst nightmare) fast food! Chicken and chips are a prized combination, so I decided to make my own version, and here it is. These wings are soft, sticky and certainly finger-licking good. Forget cutlery; your hands are all you need here!</em>

<p class="method" id="nad0003552">
<span class="green">
<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Find a pan big enough to fit the chicken wings comfortably with some space. Half fill with water and bring to the boil. When boiling, drop the chicken wings in and boil for 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003553">
<span class="green">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Drain the wings and leave to cool. Once cool enough to handle, pat them dry individually, making sure to get rid of all moisture.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003554">
<span class="green">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Clean out the pan, refill with cold water and add the salt. Add the potato chunks, place the pan on a high heat and boil for 4–5 minutes, until tender but not breaking up. Drain the potatoes, spread them out on a tray, then set aside to cool down and dry.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003555">
<span class="green">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Preheat the oven to 180°C/160°C fan/gas 4. Put the brown sauce, garlic, brown sugar, chilli sauce, soy sauce and star anise into a large bowl and mix together. Add the chicken wings and turn them around to coat them with the sauce.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003556">
<span class="green">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Transfer the wings to one large baking tray or two medium trays, keeping them in one even layer. Roast on the middle shelf of the oven for 35–40 minutes, turning the wings after 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003557">
<span class="green">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Meanwhile (about 20 minutes before the wings are done), put the oil in a large deep pan and begin to heat on a high heat. Drop a piece of potato into the oil and as soon as it starts to bubble, sizzle and float, you are ready to add the rest of the potato pieces. If you have a probe thermometer, this should be at about 180°C.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003558">
<span class="green">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Fry the chips for 6–8 minutes – they should be golden brown. Use a slotted spoon to drain them, and place them on a plate lined with kitchen paper. Sprinkle with salt.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003559">
<span class="green">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 Serve the hot wings and chips straight away. You can sprinkle thinly sliced spring onion on top of the wings, if you like.</p>

<span class="tip_head_green">Tip:</span>
 <em>If you can’t find ground star anise, you can grind four whole ones with a pestle and mortar or spice grinder, then sieve to remove any bits.</em>
