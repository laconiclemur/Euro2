			<p class="rec-intro">Like crème brûleè and crème caramel, these little desserts are set custards and are baked in individual pots, traditionally with their own lids. If you do not have pots with lids you can cover the custards with foil, making a little hole to allow steam to escape. I find that little glass yoghurt pots are ideal. </p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 8</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">3 free-range eggs</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">4 free-range egg yolks</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">100g caster sugar</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">220ml milk</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">220ml single cream</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 vanilla pod, split and seeds scraped out</p>
		</div>
		<div class="basic-text-frame">
			<p class="body">Preheat the oven to 180°C/Fan 160°C/Gas 4. Whisk the eggs and yolks with the sugar until pale. Bring the milk and cream to the boil with the vanilla pod and seeds, then pour this on to the egg mixture and whisk well. Pass the custard through a sieve and pour it into little pots or cups. Carefully remove all the froth from the tops and put on the lids or foil. Make a little hole in the foil tops, if using. </p>
			<p class="body">Place the pots in an ovenproof dish and pour in enough hot water to reach about a third of the way up the sides of the dish. Bake in the oven for about 30 minutes or until set, depending on the size. Smaller pots won’t take quite as long. Traditionally these simple little sweets are served just as they are, but if you want to dress them up, pipe a little rosette of Chantilly cream (see <a href="part0010_split_034.html#Chantilly-cream">here</a>) on top.</p>
			<p class="alt-head">Petits pots de crème au chocolat</p>
			<p class="body">For a chocolate version, stir 170g of bitter chocolate (70% cocoa solids) into the boiling milk and cream. </p>
			<p class="body">If you would like to make some of each type, divide the mixture in half and add just 85g of chocolate to one half. </p>
