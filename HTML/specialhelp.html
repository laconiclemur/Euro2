<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Boiling Milk (Koking av melk)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">When you boil milk, use a heavy-bottomed kettle. Avoid using an iron kettle unless it has a smooth bottom. Stir occasionally as the milk is brought to a boil. Watch carefully so it does not boil over. Try not to use milk for boiling direct from the refrigerator. It takes longer to boil and it tends to scorch easily. Never boil milk for a long period of time as too long of a cooking period will reduce its nutrients.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Whipping Cream (Visping av fløte)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">Chill all equipment, or set the bowl in a larger bowl with water and lots of ice. Use a rounded-off bowl of proper size for the amount of cream needed. If you use an electric mixer leave part of the beaters above the cream as this helps to whip air into the cream and prevents it from turning to butter. The best way, however, is to use those fun, large, balloon-type whisks. I believe it gives the cream a better flavor. Underbeat the cream, rather than over-beat; the goal is a soft, flavorful cream.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Smorgasbord (Smørgåsbord)</span></p>
<p class="noindent8"><i>A Norwegian food fare leaves an explicit and lasting impression on visitors to Norway, especially so when it comes to the koldtbord, or the better known word, Smørgåsbord, pronounced Smurgaws-boor. I  have brought tourists to Norway, to the fjord hotels and mountain resorts, and when they were introduced to these culinary delicacies they were amazed. Tables arrayed with an abundance of Norway’s best and colorful foods make every guest excited to taste and enjoy.</i></p>
<p class="noindent2">The <i>smørgåsbord</i> is a Scandinavian tradition. In Norway it goes back many centuries, having its start at country weddings, baptisms, or other celebrations. Due to distances and rough travel these celebrations were not a common occurrence, and when people came together they celebrated for several days. The invited guests helped by contributing the best from their kitchens, allowing the hostess to keep her guests well fed. Accordingly the tables were weighed down with a sumptuous array of delicious foods. In the seventeenth century the custom was firmly established in private homes, and during the last century the tradition spread to restaurants and hotels.</p>
<p class="indent">To the novice the <i>smørgåsbord</i> at first glance is overwhelming. Many make the mistake of sampling each food the first time around, but this does not allow one to fully savor the different flavors of the great variety of foods.</p>
<p class="indent">But do not despair; there are certain procedures to the plethora of the <i>smørgåsbord</i>. It will increase your enjoyment if you try to follow them.</p>
<p class="indent">Start with the bread and butter, and some of the wide variety of herring dishes offered. You most likely will find pickled herring, mustard, tomato, curried, sour cream, and herring in cream sauce, as well as herring salads. Follow this with the other varieties of fish: trout, salmon, lobster, shrimp, eel, and so forth.</p>
<p class="indent">Next in turn are the egg dishes and salads, then different kinds of meat. A well planned <i>smørgåsbord</i> also usually offers an assortment of hot dishes, both meat and fish, and finally, an assortment of cheeses and fruits for dessert. If you long for the delectable sweets you have read about, there will be more cakes, puddings, and creams than you ever thought possible.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red"><a id="page_174"/>Aquavit (Akevitt)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">In the early stages of the history of this drink (Norway’s “Firewater”) various spices and other plant matter were added to the liquor in order to improve its flavor. Later, when the producers learned to refine their products and to make neutral spirits, the same spices were still added—no longer to cover the bad taste, however, but simply in order to give the purer liquid any taste at all.</p>
<p class="indent">Caraway was a common spice and it grew wild in the district of Trøndelag north and south of Trondheim, and around lake Mjøsa in central Norway. These very same districts also had the country’s largest potato production—which meant, of course, that it was here the early distilleries were founded. Thus, caraway was a natural choice for flavoring; not only was the local supply abundant, but it was also considered a particularly fresh and appetizing spice.</p>
<p class="indent">Caraway seeds seem to have a natural affinity to quite a number of Norwegian food specialties. This fact may be the main reason why the Norsemen have remained faithful to the <i>traditional</i> Norwegian <i>Akevitt</i> despite the fact that it is hardly ever advertised. Potato is the base ingredient, but the caraway gives it its special flavor. It was the spread of the potato throughout Norway that led to the production of liquor on an industrial scale in the country. Up to the time of the arrival of the potato in Norway, grain was more commonly used by private individuals who made their own liquor. But the potato was much less expensive and soon became the staple raw material. The necessary process became too complicated and called for much more elaborate equipment and thus the production of liquor on an industrial scale.</p>
<p class="indent">The line <i>akevitt</i> is a specialty that goes back to the days of the old sailing ships, when the Norwe-gian Akevitt sailed the seven seas. Today the Nor-wegian state monopoly still sticks with tradition. The Akevitt sails to Australia and back. The colorful labels with the old sailing ships on each bottle of <i>Akevitt</i> certify that the Akevitt has been to Australia and back, and has crossed the Equator.</p>
<p class="indent">There are many imported liquors for sale in Norway. Wine consumption has also had quite an increase, but <i>Akevitt</i> still is the overall favorite of the Norwegians. Any liquor that is lavished with the cost of a trip halfway around the world is still the most unique and most highly prized by those who are “in the know.” To serve <i>Akevitt</i> the bottle must be cold enough to be frosty with dew, and experts say the glass should be small enough to make it possible for the dram to get lukewarm before it is finished. Akevitt has at times been called “firewater,” and a warning is out to the newcomer not to overdo. It is a mighty powerful drink! On many old Norwe-gian drinking bowls this saying has been found:</p>

<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Tips for Freezing  (Tips om å fryse mat)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2"><span class="red"><a id="page_175"/></span>Each year families lose valuable nutrition, not to mention the thousands, if not millions, of dollars lost due to inadequate packaging of frozen food. It is a total waste to spend time, energy, and money on baking or preparing nutritious foods only to lose the flavor, color, and nutrition to freezer burns because time was not allotted to wrap the food properly.</p>
<p class="indent1">Plastic wrap, plastic bags made for freezing, or aluminum foil is best. Be sure to squeeze out as much air as possible from the plastic bags. To prevent punctured plastic and light from getting to the food the final cover should be heavy brown paper (cut from paper sacks); tape and mark the weight, date, and contents correctly. (No! You will not remember the date or what it is at a later date.)</p>
<p class="indent1">It is nice to have fancy, and often expensive, food containers and wrapped packages in the freezer. But it is not necessary. You can have well-wrapped foods without spending a lot of money. Rinsed out milk or juice cartons, cottage cheese, or yogurt containers are excellent for storing soups, sauces, and casseroles. Mark and seal correctly.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Delfia Coco-fat (Delfia kokosmatfett)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">Delfia coco-fat is similar to margarine in consistency but with a totally different flavor. It is made from the oil of the coco-nut. Imported from Norway, it is available in 8.8 oz. (250 g.) packages. It can be purchased from most Scandinavian delicatessens. </p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Salt of Hartshorn—<br/>Ammonium Carbonate (Hjortetakk)</span></p>
<p class="noindent5"><i>At one time hjortetakk was made from deer antlers, but today it is chemically produced and can be purchased at a drug store as Ammonium carbonate, Aqua ammoniae, or salt of hartshorn. It is also stocked by most Scandinavian delicatessens. </i></p>
<p class="noindentt2">Salt of hartshorn was the leavening agent used in cookies and crackers. It may leave a bitter taste in large cakes that contain a larger portion of moisture. However, Norwegian cookies, known for their crispness and delicate texture, owe some credit for these qualities to salt of hartshorn. It should be kept  in a tightly-covered glass jar or it will quickly lose its effectiveness. It has a characteristic potent odor of ammonia that disappears during the cooking process. You will find it in Scandinavian delicatessens.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Pearl Sugar (Pearl Sugar)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">Pearl sugar is a coarse sugar used in Norway to sprinkle on cookies, pastries, and coffee cakes before baking. It is sometimes called crystal sugar. You will find it in Scandinavian delicatessens, or you may substitute coarsely-crushed sugar cubes. </p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Syrup (Sirup)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">The syrup recommended in all recipes throughout this book, unless otherwise stated and that most closely resembles the syrup used in Norway, is a partially inverted refiner’s syrup, such as Lyle’s Golden Syrup from England, available at many supermarkets or at import delicatessens.</p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg175_01.png"/></p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Potato Starch  Flour (Potetmel)</span></p>
<p class="noindent8"><i>Potato starch  flour, sometimes called potato  flour, is available from most Scandinavian delicatessens, health food stores, and now in many supermarkets. It is an excellent thickening agent for fruit soups, compotes, sauces, and creams, and is also used in cookies and cakes.</i></p>
<p class="indent3">When potato starch  flour is used in breads and cakes it acts as a preservative and also results in a moister product. When used for baking, substitute   cup. (1 ½ dl) of potato starch  flour for 1 cup (2 ½ dl) all-purpose  flour.</p>
<p class="indent">Anything thickened with potato starch  flour should be cooled quickly. Sprinkle with a little  <span class="red"><a id="page_176"/></span>sugar to prevent a film from forming. As a thickening agent, substitute 1 ½ teaspoons potato  flour for 1 tablespoon all-purpose  flour.</p>
<p class="indent">Using potato  flour is quick and easy. But it is important to know how it works, so you will not end up with a leathery consistency from overcooking, or a  floury taste from not bringing the food to a boil. There are a couple of methods you may use:</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Thickening method 1:</b> Mix potato  flour with a little cold water. If left standing awhile, it settles on the bottom. Just give it a quick stir just before using. Bring the food to be thickened to a boil. Remove the pan from direct heat, and add the potato starch  flour thickening in a thin stream, stirring <i>slowly</i> but continually while adding. This will prevent lumping but stirring too vigorously may cause lumping. Place the pan back on the heat and bring to a boil while continuing to stir. Remove from the heat. If boiled too long it may become watery or leathery.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Thickening method 2:</b> The following method is best for small portions. Place the potato starch  flour and food to be thickened together in a small saucepan, bring to a boil, and stir <i>slowly</i> until it begins to boil. Remove from the heat. The starchy grains in potato starch  flour are rather large and take a little while before they stick. When the foods and potato starch  flour are mixed while cold it has time to expand and begin to stick during the heating process, and the consistency will be smooth. </p>
<p class="h1bbb"><span class="red">Vanilla Bean (Vaniljestang)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">Some climbing tropical orchids produce a cylindrical, yellow-greenish colored bean or pod, from 5–10 inches (10–25 cm) long. These pods are cured and dried, and during the process they shrink and turn  to a mahogany brown color. These vanilla beans give the finest flavor and aroma of vanilla.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>To get maximum flavor</b> from the vanilla beans when purchased, they should be moist and soft, not stiff and dry. If you keep them wrapped in plastic wrap and sealed in an airtight jar, they will stay fresh for months. Some people freeze them. Either method works.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>To scrape the seeds loose</b>, place the bean on a hard surface and cut lengthwise. Scrape down the length of the bean with a teaspoon, and place the beans in a mound with a little granulated sugar from the recipe. With the tip of your finger, work it back and forth and in circles until the seeds are totally separated from the sugar. Then steep up to 30 minutes in the liquid called for in the recipe.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>To make vanilla sugar</b>, split the vanilla bean in half and place in a pound of confectioners’ or granulated sugar in an airtight jar for one week. Use as directed in the recipes.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg176_01.png"/></p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Vanilla Sugar (Vaniljesukker)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">See Vanilla Bean above on how to make your own, or purchase from a Scandinavian celicatessen or other specialty shop. See Sources p.178.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red"><a id="page_177"/>Saffron (Safran)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">One ounce of commercial saffron takes upward of 4,000 flowers of the purple autumn crocus, which grows and is harvested by hand in Spain. (Turkey and India also have choice saffron.) It has a vibrant golden color. The long threads come packed in vials or you may purchase small packets in powder form. Heat the threads in a little liquid from the recipe, leave in, or strain if desired. The powder dissolves quickly in any liquid. See Sources p.178.</p>
<p class="noinden7"><i>It is said that saffron is the world’s most expensive spice. Keep in mind, however, that you are not buying it by the pound. Recipes only call for minute quantities. And this spice is a traditional spice used in Norway.</i></p>
<p class="h1b"><span class="red">Cardamom (Kardemomme)</span></p>
<p class="noinden7"><i>Cardamom is an Asiatic plant of the ginger family, and a favorite spice in Norwegian baking. It’s very expensive and worth every penny! </i></p>
<p class="noindentt2">The small cardamom pods (break away and discard) house the black seeds used in the baking. The cardamom pods are brown, white, or green depending on which method is used to dry them.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Grind only enough cardamom seeds (using a mortar and pestle) as needed for your recipe; their flavor dissipates rather quickly. They are highly aromatic and an absolute “must spice” in Norwegian baking. You will find ground cardamom in the spice section of supermarkets, but if cardamom pods are available, choose those first. See Sources p.178.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Orange and Lemon rind<br/>(Appelsin og sitronskall)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">Instead of throwing out all those orange and lemon peels, grate some of them. Wash the fruit well. Grate only the orange and yellow peel, the white part though rich in bioflavonoids (an important part of the vitamin C complex) it will leave a bitter taste. Use a dry brush to easily remove all the rind from the grater. If this is too much trouble for you some gourmet shops now have citrus oils, squeezed from the rind of the fresh fruits; no oil is added. About ½  teaspoon citrus oil equals 1 tablespoon rind. They can be ordered by mail from The King Arthur  Flour Baker’s catalog. See Sources p.178.</p>

<p class="noindent1">Delightful, delectable, delicious Freia chocolate! We seem to be encircled about by chocolate, from the darkest to the purest white. However, not all chocolates are equal, and using an inferior chocolate can ruin an otherwise delicious recipe.</p>
<p class="indent1">In recipes calling for chocolate in this book I have used Freia, the world renowned Norwegian chocolate. Both Freia Dronning and Selskapssjokolade, semi-sweet cooking chocolate, come in 4.38 oz. (125 g.) bars. Freia cooking and eating chocolates are available in Scandinavian delicatessens or by mail. See Sources p.178.</p>
