<p class="noindentt"><em>The New Spanish Table</em> is the result of my two decades of travel in Spain, an exhilarating odyssey across one of the world’s greatest foodscapes. The first time I visited the country was in the early eighties, as it was awakening from the isolation and destitution of the Franco years. I was instantly smitten with the regional rigor, the immense pull of traditions, the purity and warmth of the food culture. I became hooked on the rustic <em>asadores</em> of Castile where macho maestros roasted suckling lamb in wood-burning ovens. When I visited Valencia and Alicante expecting to find only one kind of paella, I stumbled upon whole cults devoted to rice. In the Basque country, I went crazy for <em>pinxtos,</em> the ornate local version of tapas. In Catalonia I marveled at the Mediterranean grace of the coastal <em>cocina</em> and at the intriguing inland combinations like salt cod with honey or rabbit with chocolate. In <a id="page_xiv"/>Andalusia I ate my way through an encyclopedia of gazpachos and stayed up until <em>madrugada</em> (dawn) gulping sherry at smoky flamenco dives.</p>
<p class="indent">Besotted by Spain and its cuisine, I returned again and again—making pilgrimages to markets, fried fish shacks, and sausage shops; to countryside cider houses for fizzy apple brew and rare <em>chuletas</em>—T-bones, charred and thick as an airport novel; up to hilltop villages for roast baby pig with the crispest of skins; along rocky coastal roads to seafood hideaways for pristine langoustines and Europe’s best salt-baked fish. Between meals I zipped from one crowded tapas bar to the next, comparing their crispy <em>patatas bravas</em> and garlicky shrimp. Addictive—but back in those days, Spain still had a one-note cuisine, elegant in its austerity but somehow lost in a time-warp.</p>
<p class="indent">Over the years, I have watched as Spain transformed itself from an almost archaic Mediterranean culture into a European capital of style and design. Yet despite its thrust into modernity, the country has kept globalization at bay, retaining the authenticity that seduced me in the first place. And something truly extraordinary has happened—fostered by a desire to break with the past: The boom that gripped Spanish cultural life after Franco, producing figures like filmmaker Pedro Almódovar, has taken hold in Spanish kitchens. “Eating well is part of our new freedom, it has made us feel modern,” says my friend José Carlos Capel, the influential food critic for Madrid’s <em>El País</em> newspaper.</p>
<p class="pagebreak"> </p>
<h3 class="h3">REVOLUTIONARY CUISINE</h3>
<p class="noindent">New Spanish cuisine was conceived in the belle époque Basque resort of San Sebastián in the late 1970s. Impressed by the vibrant delicacy of revolutionary <em>nouvelle cuisine</em> across the border in France, a group of Basque chefs that included Juan Mari Arzak and Pedro Subijana decided to stage their own revolution. The result was <em>nueva cocina vasca,</em> or new Basque cuisine—a lighter, fresher, prettier, unapologetically modern style, both cutting edge <em>and</em> solidly grounded in Basque ingredients and traditions. It wasn’t a coincidence that these first innovations took place in the Basque <a id="page_xv"/>province of Guipuzcua, the most food-centric corner of Europe, that today boasts an improbably high concentration of Michelin stars. <em>Nueva cocina</em> soon spread across Spain, giving rise to new modern regional styles.</p>
<p class="indent">And then something radical happened. A self-taught Catalan genius named Ferran Adrià arrived on the scene. I had my first meal at Adrià’s restaurant, El Bulli, in 1997, the year that he was awarded his third Michelin star and hailed by the great French chef Joel Robuchon as “the best cook on the planet.” To get to El Bulli from the Catalan resort town of Rosas, I drove up the world’s most treacherous, pot-holed dirt road. Though Adrià was already creating a stir in the food circles, El Bulli’s whitewashed dining room was nearly empty when I arrived for lunch. (Today the restaurant gets around 300,000 early reservation requests and the chances of scoring a table without one are practically zero.) While enjoying aperitifs on the terrace, I looked down on a villa above a picturesque cove, inhaling the scent of Mediterranean fir trees. But that’s where the familiar gave way to the uncanny.</p>
<p class="indent">My degustation menu unfolded in a series of edible whimsies, each dish a nose-thumbing to convention. Some of the <em>amuse-gueules</em>—a Parmesan ice-cream sandwich, a poached quail egg in a caramel cage—introduced the concept of dessert-as-dinner. Another Daliesque provocation was “smoke foam,” a mousse made from water that had been smoked over burning wood. The rest of the meal? Egg-yolk sabayon with whipped cream and hazelnut vanilla sauce (a savory appetizer!). A garlicky ice cream of <em>ajo blanco</em> (an Andalusian almond gazpacho). Cuttlefish-and-coconut ravioli. Sardine roll-ups filled with raspberry froth (“<em>El señor chef</em> is in his ‘foam’ phase,” a waiter confided). Eggplant ravioli stuffed with a yogurt mousse and caramelized with ... Fisherman’s Friend (a licorice cough lozenge). The finale was a sculptural contraption holding sublime and outrageous <em>petits fours.</em></p>
<p class="indent">After lunch I had the good fortune to talk with Adrià for hours. I drove away completely under his spell, convinced that Europe’s culinary future belonged to Spain. Almost every year I’ve returned to El Bulli in awe at Adrià’s outrageously inventive thirty-course tasting menus that blend high design with groundbreaking scientific research. A self-proclaimed heir to Salvador Dalí, Adrià keeps developing his iconoclastic vocabulary, spending six months a year at his <em>taller</em> (laboratory) in Barcelona where he experiments with new dishes while El Bulli is closed for vacation.</p>

<p class="box-title">THE ADRIA EFFECT</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent"><a id="page_xvi"/>Ferran Adrià’s influence in Spain—and beyond—can’t be underestimated. He was the one who taught other chefs to create bewitching trompe l’oeil effects; to break down the boundaries between sweet and savory, hot and cold, liquid and solid; to refract ingredients into contrasting elements; to make use of such edible ephemera as savory ice creams, foams and bubbly airs, and hot and cold gelées. Most importantly, he taught chefs to reexamine traditional cooking methods through the prism of physics and chemistry. Today, the fanciful and often surreal fusion of cuisine and science is de rigueur in contemporary Spanish kitchens. In Gerona, for instance, two Michelin-starred brother chefs have been working with fragrance experts on desserts that replicate scents of famous perfumes (Lancôme as a final course). In Bilbao, with the help of a dairy scientist, the young chef at the Restaurante Guggenheim has created ephemeral riffs based on casein and curds. Spanish chefs are probing rice DNA to improve their paellas; using laser technology to perfect a grill pan; inventing futuristic vacuum distillers to extract colorless “flavor essences” from ingredients; applying liquid nitrogen to gazpachos; and poaching vacuum-packed food in a space-age bain marie originally used by biologists for heating vaccines. One chef even recruited a medical liver transplant specialist to help him improve his foie gras! It’s as if the whole country were transformed into a giant poetically-touched food science lab. And if, in the past, Spanish cooks looked to France for new ideas, now even the most die-hard French snobs admit that for culinary adventure they cross the border to Spain. Welcome to the food mecca of the twenty-first century.</p>

<p class="pagebreak"> </p>
<h3 class="h3">COOK THIS AT HOME</h3>
<p class="noindent">But who can tackle lab-perfect liquid nitrogen mojitos at home? Happily, visionary chefs like Adrià and Arzak and the Basque and Catalan culinary vanguard are only part of the story. Even the most experimental among Spanish chefs would be the first ones to acknowledge their debt to traditional cooking and to the luminous quality of local ingredients. It is this fusion of tradition and innovation that makes eating in Spain so thrilling right now. The divide between high and low, haute and homey, classic and iconoclastic, rustic and refined can be deliciously blurred. Owners of centuries-old tapas bars send their children for a <em>stage</em> (apprenticeship) at Michelin-starred meccas to pick up new cooking techniques. Avant-garde chefs, meanwhile, hang out at their favorite classic haunts, soaking up the rigorous simplicity of ingredient-driven <em>cocina popular.</em> In Spain, everyone eats at everyone else’s restaurants and the country is united in its adoration of food.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_xvii"/>So the exciting news for American home cooks is this: The same creative process that pushed Spain into the culinary stratosphere has transformed it into an epicenter of casual, thoroughly modern Mediterranean cooking—exquisite in its simplicity, yet often startling in its quiet inventiveness. Gazpachos these days come in a rainbow of flavors and colors, with arresting and varied textural flourishes. The modern tapas of San Sebastián are a showcase of what can be done with a piece of bread and a few simple ingredients. The range and creativity of desserts is unsurpassed. The presentations are fun and artistic yet simple enough to reproduce at home. Most importantly, each bite still feels fresh and new. While seemingly every culinary corner of France and Italy has been explored under a microscope, Spain remains an El Dorado with an immense untapped wealth of the kind of unfussy, elegant, alluring Mediterranean flavors we all swoon for these days. You want style? Spain’s got style. You want simplicity? It’s got simplicity. You want rustic slow-cooked bean or lamb casseroles to warm the soul in the winter—Spain has that, too.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s impossible to resist the siren call of those Mediterranean-Moorish ingredients: aromatic splashes of olive oil, almonds and hazelnuts pounded into simple but emphatic sauces, garlic and parsley, piquillo peppers, tomatoes and saffron, pungent olives and anchovies, coarse sea salt and smoky paprika, lemons and bitter oranges. It’s difficult not to admire the playful laid-back way the Spanish entertain. They make it all seem so simple, with an array of small tapas or a big earthenware <em>cazuela</em> placed on the table so that guests can help themselves while the hosts sit back and sip wine. Little wonder that Spanish lifestyle and way of eating is the envy of Europe.</p>

<h3 class="h3">ABOUT THE RECIPES</h3>
<p class="noindent">Recipes in <em>The New Spanish Table</em> are culled from different corners of Spain—Mallorca to Galicia to Extremadura—and I sincerely believe they do justice to the excitement and regional diversity of modern Spanish cuisine. Yet, it wasn’t my aim to compile a comprehensive compendium of classic regional cooking. Instead the selection of dishes here reflects my personal travels and taste. If recipes from Catalonia and the Basque Country predominate, it’s because I’m especially smitten with the foods of these regions. If the emphasis is on stylish, healthy, modern cuisine that romances <a id="page_xviii"/>seafood, vegetables, legumes, and olive oil, that’s because I subscribe to this way of eating. Many recipes traveled perfectly and turned out like a dream in my New York kitchen. Other masterpieces I tasted in Spain got lost in translation. And for all my desire to convert cooks to far-out experimental Spanish techniques, I doubt that most are willing to tackle foam making and vacuum poaching at home. In the end, I found a way to deliver practical, accessible recipes without sacrificing excitement and authenticity.</p>
<p class="indent">Ranging from classic to creative, from traditional to trendy and back, the dishes here come from an extraordinary wealth of sources. Year after year I traveled through Spain, calling on my favorite chefs and discovering new talent as I reported on the country’s astounding gastronomic developments for magazines such as <em>Food&amp;Wine</em> and <em>Travel+Leisure.</em> I ate and took notes and asked for recipes that were <em>delicioso, estupendo, tremendo, genial,</em> and <em>fenomenal.</em> I got them from Michelin three-star luminaries like Ferran Adrià, Juan Mari Arzak, and Martin Berasategui; from mustachioed owners of obscure tapas bars in minuscule hamlets; from market vendors, taxi drivers, pig breeders, and winemakers’ aunts. I’ve peered over the shoulders of rice specialists in Valencia, attended high profile avant-garde chefs’ conferences, and spent hours interviewing prominent Spanish food writers, magazine editors, and restaurant critics. I visited cheesemakers, <em>cava bodegas,</em> paprika factories, and convents populated by sisters who bake like a dream.</p>
<p class="indent">Those looking for perfect renditions of traditional warhorses like gazpacho, paella, sangria, and tapas won’t be disappointed. There are also plenty of fresh, easy fish recipes from the coast, hearty paprika-spiked bean and potato pots from the heartland, classic vegetable mélanges, and sweets from master bakers, grandmothers, and nuns. But cuisines evolve—and nowhere more so than in Spain. Next to classic tapas like <em>patatas bravas</em> and garlic shrimp, I’ve included New Wave creations such as tuna tartare with a date and almond sauce, and a truffled potato tortilla. Alongside traditional tomato gazpacho <em>The New Spanish Table</em> features creative chilled soups, such as cherry and beet gazpacho and a gazpacho sorbet. Fish recipes swing from fishermen’s stews and shellfish pots to elegant restaurant dishes like scallops with candied lemon. For dessert, choose between a seventeenth-century hot chocolate or a twenty-first-century chocolate mousse startlingly accented with sea salt and olive oil. This is how Spain eats today. And no other country on Earth is better fed. <em>¡Buen provecho!</em></p>
