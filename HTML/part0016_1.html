Meat was chopped with a knife and manually stuffed with any device that would be suitable. Back fat was normally cut into long and narrow strips. Wood for smoking was often wet and the final product was very dark. Sometimes after smoking the sausages were over baked or sometimes still raw and needed to be cooked in water. In many cases sausages were not smoked at all but dried for a few hours over a hot stove plate and then kept in a cool place. Then the sausage was boiled in water before serving.</span></p><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_93" src="../images/00048.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Fig. 13.1</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> To stuff sausage casings with manually cut meat any suitable device was used: a section of pipe, a funnel or an animal stuffing horn.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">Old keys were massive pieces of metal and the loop of the key would be inserted into the end of the casing. The casing would be held around the key loop with fingers. The other end of the casing would be tied with butcher’s twine.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Meat would be pushed down through the loop of the key and from time to time the casing would be removed and meat would be pushed down further by squeezing the casing on the outside. The process would eliminate most of the air which was important as most sausages were smoked and air dried. This operation would be repeated until the casing would be full.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Then the open end of the casing would be tied with twine and the sausage would be rolled over on a flat surface to make it straight. Any air pockets would be removed by pricking them with a needle.</span></p><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_94" src="../images/00058.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Fig. 13.2</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> Key method of stuffing a sausage.</span></p><p class="calibre_14" id="filepos812600"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_66">Finger Sausage </span></span></span><span class="calibre1"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_66">(Palcówka)</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_67"><a href="part0007.html#filepos341187"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_68"><span class="underline">Back to Recipe Index</span></span></span></a></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">One of the oldest known sausages that gets its name from the method used to fill the casing. The casings were stuffed with fingers (palce) by means of any suitable device like a pipe, funnel or a horn (stuffing horn). Needless to say a meat grinder was either not invented yet, or only a few lucky ones happened to own it. The majority of people had to chop meat manually with a knife. </span></span></p><p class="calibre_77"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">That required careful meat selection and removal of all inedible parts like sinews, gristle, parts of tendon, etc. Today a grinder will cut and mechanically tenderize meat at the same time but in those times meat was cut into little chunks. The product was definitely juicy and first class.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre_2">Pork butt, 400 g (0.88 lb)</span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2">Lean pork (ham) or lean beef, 400 g (0.88 lb)</span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2">Belly or back fat, 200 g (0.44 lb)</span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">Ingredients per 1 kg (2.2 lb) of meat</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre_2">Salt, 21 g (3-1/2 tsp)</span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2">Cure #1, 2.5 g (1/2 tsp)</span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2">Pepper, 2.0 g (1 tsp)</span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2">Sugar, 3.0 g (1/2 tsp)</span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2">Garlic, 1.5 g (1/2 clove)</span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2">Coriander, 1.0 g (1/2 tsp)</span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2">White mustard seeds, 1.0 g (1/2 tsp)</span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2">Marjoram, 1.0 g (1/2 tsp)</span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre_2">Allspice, 1.0 g (1/2 tsp)</span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">Curing</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> - Cut meat into ½-¾” (1-2 cm) pieces.

This particular sausage had to be good if it was nicknamed the nobility sausage.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">Old records indicate that this sausage was already produced at the beginning of the XVII century when everything was made by hand and the word meat technology was not invented yet. Many say that this is The Sausage of all of them and that nothing else comes close. All we can say that this recipe is quite original if only for the fact that it calls for sea salt. Sea salt which contains many minerals was often added when bone in hams were made in a traditional way. The reason was that sea salt having coarse grain would keep on eliminating moisture much longer than regular salt. It also had a milder flavor.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">You may also wonder why eggs were used. Well, lean meat class I has no connective tissue and is ill suited for binding sliced meats together.
