<p class="author1"><span class="txit">crostone di pane “all’occhio di bue”</span></p>
<p class="noindentb"><span class="txit">All’Occhio di Bue</span> means “the eyes of the bull,” which is a colorful way of describing what poached eggs look like. In this recipe, simple poached eggs are taken to a higher level with the addition of fresh herbs and pecorino Toscano cheese. Pecorino Toscano is a soft, mild sheep’s milk cheese. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find in the United States, so instead you may substitute Asiago, Fontina, Emmenthaler, or even an extra-sharp cheddar. For this recipe, use a vegetable peeler to shave paper-thin slices of cheese.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 slices country-style bread</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 clove garlic, cut in half</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon chopped fresh herbs (rosemary, sage, parsley, oregano, marjoram, tarragon, or chives)</span></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Freshly ground black pepper</span></p>

Break 1 egg into a small bowl and gently slide it into the water. Do the same one at a time with the other 3 eggs. Cook until the whites of the eggs are solid but the yolks are still runny, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place one egg on top of each slice of bread.</p>
