  <p class="chap-para">I love roasted peppers, and this nutritious filling makes them a healthy complete meal. Filling peppers with rice is quite common in Mediterranean countries, but I find they can be a little bland; I have made a quick risotto with some summer vegetables to use as the stuffing and the addition of mint gives a pleasant refreshing flavour. You can make this dish very colourful by using red, yellow, green and orange peppers. I have suggested one pepper per person, but if, like me, you are greedy, double the quantities – you can always enjoy them cold or heated up the next day.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra to drizzle</p>

  <p class="ing1">½ onion, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">150g/5½oz/¾ cup arborio rice</p>

  <p class="ing1">½ courgette (zucchini), cubed</p>

  <p class="ing1">½ aubergine (eggplant), cubed</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 tsp tomato purée (paste)</p>

  <p class="ing1">700ml/1¼ pints/3 cups hot <a href="part0007_split_013.html#pg32" class="calibre1">vegetable stock</a> – or use a stock cube</p>

  <p class="ing1">30g/1oz Parmesan, grated</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 large (bell) peppers</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 ball of mozzarella (about 125g/4½oz), cubed</p>

  <p class="ing2">a handful of fresh mint leaves, torn</p>

  <p class="para">Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas mark 4. Heat the olive oil in a saucepan, add the onion and sweat on a medium heat until softened. Stir in the rice until each grain is coated with oil. Stir in the courgette, aubergine and tomato purée, then add a little stock and cook until absorbed.</p>

  <p class="para">Gradually add the remaining stock, stirring all the time, for 12–15 minutes. The rice should still be quite firm. Remove from the heat, stir in the Parmesan, taste for seasoning and leave to cool slightly.</p>

  <p class="para">Slice the tops off the peppers, keeping the stems so they look like little hats, and set aside. Put the peppers in a lightly oiled baking dish. Half-fill them with the risotto, add a few cubes of mozzarella, gently pressing it into the filling, and some mint. Add the remaining risotto and more mozzarella, pressing it in. Put the ‘hats’ on the filled peppers, drizzle with a little olive oil, cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for another 15 minutes.</p>

  <p class="para1">Remove from the oven and leave to rest for 5 minutes before serving. Can also be enjoyed cold.</p>
