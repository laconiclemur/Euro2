<p class="first_paragraph" id="nad0000773">I don’t often have enormous parties. Not because I dislike company, as in fact I think there is nothing nicer than spending hours in a room full of friends talking about anything and everything. And not because I don’t like feeding people, because (if I may say so myself!) that’s the one talent I do have. It’s also not because I don’t like to be in the kitchen, because that is my favourite place to be. No, the reason I don’t often have big parties is because I hate the idea of clearing up afterwards. The very thought of it completely puts me off. But every now and again common sense prevails and I realize I like nothing more than talking, feeding people and cooking nice things, so I throw a party and face my fear. And in the end, when faced with that dreaded clear-up after everyone’s gone, it’s normally not as bad as I thought it would be. Especially as it turns out I am very good at convincing my husband that he is the best clearer-upper in the whole wide world. (Works every time!) So in the spirit of having big parties more often, this chapter is full of my favourite recipes for a large turnout. Some are a bit more advanced than others, but they all make for a great party!</p>
