<h2 class="h2b">DAURADE EN PAPILLOTE</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Baked Sea Bream</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>Cooking</em> en papillote <em>is simplicity itself. The packets hold in all of the flavours which are released when the paper is cut into, filling the room with heady aromas. Here, the peppers and onions combine in their plump little envelopes with the juices from the bream, the olive oil and wine to give a creamy aromatic bed to the barely flaking fish</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
4 × 200g (7oz) boneless fillets of sea bream, skin on<br/>
2 large onions, peeled and sliced<br/>
2 large red peppers, seeded and finely sliced<br/>
2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced<br/>
100ml (3½fl oz) extra virgin olive oil<br/>
200ml (7fl oz) white or rosé wine<br/>
Salt and cayenne pepper<br/>
3 large sprigs fresh thyme or savory, leaves picked from the stalks, chopped</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 180°C/350°F/Gas 4.</p>
<p class="normala">Sweat the onion, sliced pepper and garlic in half the olive oil and half the wine, covered, for about 15 minutes until completely soft. Remove the lid and reduce until almost dry. Season with salt and cayenne and set aside.</p>
<p class="normala">Cut 4 × 30cm (12in) pieces of baking paper, sprinkle a little of the thyme on top and distribute the onion and pepper mixture between the bottom halves of these. Put the sea bream on top, sprinkle over the rest of the thyme and drizzle over the remaining olive oil and wine. Season with cayenne then brush the edges of the paper with egg white, fold the top layer over and seal the edges by folding over and over until they are airtight.</p>
<p class="normala">Put the packets on a tray and bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes: the packets should puff right up. Slide them off the trays on to plates and serve immediately.</p>
