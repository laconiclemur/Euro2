<p class="yield">MAKES ABOUT 6 CUPS/1 KG COOKED GARBANZO BEANS</p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote">Garbanzo beans need to be soaked overnight before cooking. In “hard” or chlorinated city water, soaking them with some baking soda will help soften. If soaking time much exceeds 16 hours, change the water. Never presoak for more than 24 hours. To help soften them during cooking, garbanzo beans are added to boiling water (unlike other pulses). For the same reason, add salt only at the end. Gently shake the pot—don’t stir with a spoon—to keep them in perfect shape.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 POUND/455 G DRIED GARBANZO BEANS</li>
<li>1½&gt; TEASPOONS BAKING SODA (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li>1 SMALL ONION, PEELED</li>
<li>1 GARLIC CLOVE, UNPEELED</li>
<li>1 BAY LEAF</li>
<li>1 SPRIG FRESH OR DRIED THYME</li>
<li>1½&gt; TEASPOONS SALT</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt">Rinse the beans with cold water. In a large bowl, dissolve the baking soda (if using) in plenty of cold water. Add the beans, place the bowl in a cool spot, and soak for 12 hours. Drain, rinse away any yeasty or fermenting odors, and drain again.</p>
<p class="method_txt">In a large, heavy pot, bring 10 cups/2.4 L water to a boil over high heat. Add the beans, onion, garlic, bay leaf, and thyme. Return to a boil, reduce the heat, cover the pot, and gently boil until tender, between 1% and 2 hours, gently shaking (not stirring) from time to time. Add the salt once the beans begin to soften. If the pot needs more water during cooking, add boiling water.</p>
<p class="method_txt">Remove the pot from the heat and leave the beans in the water until ready to use. Drain and discard the onion, garlic, and herbs.</p>
