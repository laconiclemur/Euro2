<p class="author1"><span class="txit">prosciutto con fichi</span></p>
<p class="noindent">I remember as a child observing the autumnal ritual of protecting the fig trees my mother’s father had planted in his yard. They produced abundant quantities of luscious purple figs for decades. In early autumn, the trees were tightly wrapped in oilcloth, bent over, staked, and buried under dirt and leaves to protect them from the cold winter weather. Each spring the fig trees were righted and unwrapped in time to bloom and bear fruit for another season.</p>
<p class="indentb">This simple recipe is a variation on the traditional prosciutto with melon. It may be served on individual plates to guests seated at the table or presented on a platter as part of a buffet. I find it to be an elegant and profoundly sexual appetizer—but since this is a family cookbook I’ll leave it at that!</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">6 ripe figs</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">8 very thin slices prosciutto</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">Quarter each fig. Slice each piece of prosciutto lengthwise into thirds. Drape a slice of prosciutto over each fig quarter so that the prosciutto covers most of the fig.</p>
