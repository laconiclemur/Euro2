<h1 class="chapter1">CACHI, MASCARPONE E BASILICA</h1>
<h1 class="chapter">persimmons, mascarpone &amp; basil</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>If you have ever seen bright orange, shiny globes on bare trees in late autumn or early winter in Tuscany, those are persimmons (also known as <i>cachi</i> or sharon fruit). They look like embarrassed baubles that have arrived a little early for the Christmas party. If it is a cold year they are often brought in to ripen in a warm place at home. Giancarlo buys them firm and puts them in a small basket of straw in our kitchen. He watches them daily like someone waiting for eggs to hatch. When soft and tender to the touch he slices off the top and eats them with a spoon. They are naturally sweet and good for dessert or with cheese.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 6 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>4 ripe persimmons</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>a splash of Vin Santo or other sweet wine or brandy</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>handful of small basil leaves, to serve</b></p>
<p class="tx3"><b>FOR THE CREAM</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>200 g (7 oz/scant 1 cup) mascarpone</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>5 tablespoons Vin Santo, other sweet wine or brandy</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1–2 tablespoons icing (confectioners') sugar</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Wash the persimmons in cold water. Cut off and discard the tops, and slice the flesh into 5 mm- (¼ in-) thick circles. Lay them on a serving plate and splash over the wine. Combine the ingredients for the cream and adjust the sweetness to your liking. Dollop the cream around the plate and scatter over the basil leaves. Serve straight away or chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.</p>
