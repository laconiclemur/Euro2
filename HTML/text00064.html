</h1>
<p class="pf">I have traveled many trends in my lifetime. From the simplicity of the family farm on which I grew up to the scholarly approach of academics to the exploration of heritage and global cuisines, from the confusion of fusion to industry and business to the “chefisms” of nouvelle cuisine and nutritionism, and the influences of television and the media. Cooking for me began on a woodstove on a spartan farm in northern Minnesota, where we prepared meals for hungry hired men who cut lumber with double-handled saws and swamp grass with scythes. At the same time, we cooked for our expanding family. In college, my kitchen journey was further colored by working for a high-class family while being exposed to the world of entertaining dignitaries. It was a difficult transition, then, to cooking as a newlywed and adjusting to meals for two.</p>
<p>Cooking for my own family meant adjusting from preparing meals for two, to three, to four, then five, and entertaining on weekends. All this required a bit of curiosity and flexibility, just as every other stage of my life in cooking did. I suppose, along the way, that publishing twenty-nine cookbooks satisfied my longing to dig a little deeper into many areas of cooking and to explore ideas. Today, the challenge is different. Dick and I are “empty nesters,” and although we are cooking for two again, it’s different. When we go out to eat, we split a meal or request take-out boxes. We cut a single pork chop into two servings. A big baked potato is enough for both of us. And so the ingredients of my life in and with food keep changing.</p>
<p>When people ask me if I am retired, or when I will retire, my standard answer is, “I don’t have anything to retire from!” By definition, retirement is the point when a person stops employment completely. But when you are self-employed, the line is a bit obscured. When does a wife retire from wifehood? Or when does a mother retire from motherhood? And when does a writer and a cook retire?</p>
<p>In truth, it’s back to “simple is best” for me in the kitchen, just as it was on the farm in Floodwood growing up. Simple cooking doesn’t have to be boring, not with so many ideas, flavors, and techniques to explore today. After all, simple cooking in Minnesota is different from simple cooking in Mexico or India or Sweden or England or any other part of the world. I like to explore the simple cooking of many countries. That is my new passion.</p>

<p>I keep thinking about a greeting card I read years ago. It said, “They tell me I’m a has-been. Was I?”</p>
