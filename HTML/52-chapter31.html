<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Brought to Spain from Peru in the sixteenth century, the potato carried its indigenous name <em>papa</em> for a couple of centuries before being largely replaced with the word <em>patata</em>. In parts of Andalucía (as well as in the Canary Islands), though, potatoes are still called papas just like they are today in South America. One of the favorite ways to eat papas around the region of Cádiz is boiled, sliced, and tossed with shallots in a heady vinaigrette. A simple, delightful bar tapa, you often find it topped with some flakes of tinned tuna or mackerel-like <em>melva</em> or a bit of chopped hardboiled egg.</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">     It is important to dress the potatoes while still warm and soft so that they can absorb more oil and vinegar and be more flavorful in the end. After blending, the potatoes should be moist but not soupy with the vinaigrette. While they are most commonly eaten at room temperature, if desired, you can cover and refrigerate until slightly chilled before serving.</span></strong></p>

<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Wash but do not peel the potatoes. Place them in a large pot, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Add a generous pinch of salt, reduce the heat, partly cover the pot, and gently boil until they are tender and the tip of a knife can easily penetrate, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a colander to drain and cool.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> When the potatoes are cool enough to handle—but still warm—peel off the skin with your fingers. Cut the potatoes crosswise into ½&gt;- to 1-inch-/1.25- to 2.5-cm-thick slices and place them in a large glass or ceramic salad bowl. Add the shallots and parsley.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil and vinegar (use a bit more for a bolder punch) until cloudy and blended. Pour over the potatoes, season with salt and pepper, and turn over to coat well. Let cool to room temperature before serving.</p>
