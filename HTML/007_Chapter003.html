  <p class="fmh"><a id="page_86"/><span class="italic">Why Is No One Biting?</span></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="small">FISH IS FAST FOOD</span>—it’s true, there’s no other food that’s easier to work with than fish. Toss on some lemon, salt, and pepper, and then into the oven it goes. The only challenge with fish is when it’s still alive and swimming! You can’t count on it, you can’t trust it, and it’s always MIA when you need it. It’s almost like the fish knows when you’re hoping for a great catch.</p>

  <p class="indent">It’s just like during a recording for an American show I was taping in Gothenburg. There we were, the whole team, with a kitchen set up on the beach, and we were all just waiting to catch something. The only thing we managed to get on the hook that day was a sorry little mackerel. A whole nation wanted us to catch something.… In Swedish, the letters T and V can also stand for “Tålmodigt Väntande” or “Patiently Waiting,” which is exactly what we doing in abundance!</p>

  <p class="indent">We were all out early in the morning with the boat fully loaded, camera equipment, kitchen equipment, TV host—yeah, pretty much everything we could possibly need. The mackerel swarms were supposed to be a bit off shore, so I got into position and started rehearsing my lines—all the while I threw out the hook, line, and sinker, as they call it in fishing terms. I’ve never really understood the colorful baits, and if I were a mackerel I would seriously have thought they <a id="page_87"/>were crabs and made sure to stay far away from them! But enough of that. We basically sat there… waiting… with not a single mackerel in sight.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/86-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent">So what do you do when the whole program is banking on you catching a fish, and the hourly rate for the team on this boat is ticking away faster than a gypsy cab? Well, that’s when you’re grateful to learn something new. Such as, that you can’t let a whole show go to ruin because of something beyond your control. The only thing for it was to start shopping for a mackerel that still had its head on. After we had scoured all the fish markets in the tiny village, we finally found a whole bag of frozen mackerels from the previous year.</p>

  <p class="indent">We defrosted one little mackerel slowly on newspaper, carried it onto the boat, and carefully placed it on the hook. All we could do was keep our fingers crossed that the fish head wouldn’t just fall off the body! Luckily, it stayed in place, and what you see on the screen is just acting.</p>

  <p class="indent">I’m up front, giving my introduction, and—get a fish on the hook! I pull up the fish and shake the fishing rod to make it look like the fish is alive and splashing. I then put it in the bucket and say:</p>

  <p class="indent">“Wow, look, it’s truly alive…”</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/86-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="img"><a id="page_88"/><img alt="image" src="../Images/87-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent">When it comes to cooking fish, many great home cooks have no self-confidence whatsoever. They’re afraid to overcook the fish and find it difficult to season and to pair with side dishes. If this is you, go ahead and try the recipes “Fish in Top Shape—Everyday in a Can” on pages 118–120. You simply cannot fail! Many people also get stuck trying one or two kinds of fish, and these are the only ones they use! This is a shame since there are so many types of fish to choose from in today’s markets. Try to pan-fry a piece of sea bream and serve it with lemon-mashed potatoes. It’s a delicious everyday meal. Another thing: you have to fail sometimes. Otherwise you’ll never learn how to make it properly.</p>

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_89"/><span class="bold">THINK LIKE TINA</span></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">HOW CAN I TELL IF THE FISH IS FRESH?</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Fresh fish should smell fresh like the sea. It should have mucus on its eyes and moist, dark red gills.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/88-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">RIGOR MORTIS</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">The meat of the fish is always best before rigor mortis (the period of stiffness that occurs after death) sets in. The fish first turns stiff as a rod and then goes totally limp. After rigor mortis, decomposition begins and the enzymes start to break down.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">RAW SALMON</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">If you plan on eating raw, wild salmon, the FDA recommends freezing it for up to seven days (or less depending on temperature). This doesn’t apply to farmed salmon.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">DON’T BOIL—JUST SIMMER</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">If you boil fish it will fall apart. This is why fish should <span class="italic">always</span> be simmered.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">LOW OVEN TEMPERATURES ARE BEST</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Baking fish in the oven at low temperatures gives the best results. At oven temperatures between 200ºF (90ºC) and 250ºF (120ºC), the fish releases the least amount of moisture and it stays nice and juicy.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">WHEN IS THE FISH READY?</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">When cooking a whole fish, the temperature at the fish’s core should be 130ºF (55ºC). If you cook a fillet, it should be between 118ºF (48ºC) and 125ºF (52ºC), except when it comes to salmon, which is fully cooked when between 113ºF (45ºC) and 118ºF (48ºC). These temperatures may be a little too exact for the everyday cook, but it can be a fun tidbit of knowledge for when you want to show off for your guests. Just use a regular kitchen thermometer to check the temperature so your fish is perfectly cooked.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">LIGHTY SALTING THE FISH</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Lightly salting the fish is done in part to bring out the taste but also to make the fish firmer in texture. Salt the fish at two tablespoons per pound for about twenty minutes.</p>

  <p class="img"><a id="page_90"/><img alt="image" src="../Images/89-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">BROIL THE FISH IN A PAN</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Broiling usually refers to grilling over an open flame, but in this instance we’re talking about broiling the fish in a frying pan—and preferably only on the side that has the skin still on it. This method works best with fatty fish.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">TO FRY IN FAT OR NOT?</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Fatty fish such as salmon and mackerel with skin can be broiled/pan-fried without fat. Less fatty fish, such as freshwater fish and cod, is best cooked with both butter and oil in the pan.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">WHY FRY WITH BOTH BUTTER AND OIL IN THE PAN?</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">You see, the oil is there because it can handle higher temperatures, and the butter is used for its taste.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/89-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">COOKING WITH LEMON JUICE</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">When you squeeze lemon juice over salmon, for example, the acid breaks down the proteins and the cooking process begins. You’ll notice that the salmon turns a lighter shade. This is how ceviche is prepared.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/89-3.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">WHEN IS SHELLFISH AT ITS BEST?</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">It’s said that shellfish is at its best when the sea is at its coldest.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">SHRIMP COCKTAIL WITH CRAB</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Make your shrimp cocktail extra special by adding some fresh crab. Serve with asparagus and lemon sauce (see <a href="../Text/007_Chapter003.html#page_107">page 107</a>) or green pea guacamole (see <a href="../Text/010_Chapter006.html#page_252">page 252</a>).</p>

  <p class="h2a"><a id="page_93"/>39. Västervik Salad with <span class="italic">Boquerones</span> and Olives</p>

  <p class="noindentl">This salad was named after the Swedish town Västervik, since this dish was created during a filming there. Perhaps the ingredients aren’t very “Västervik,” but I was inspired by the pier at Pepparängen, under the sunny skies. Yes, it does take some time to create the <span class="italic">boquerones</span>, but it’s definitely worth it. If you’re feeling a little lazy, you can just use regular sardines.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">10 oz (300 g) new potatoes</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3½ oz (100 g) fresh haricot verts</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">10 oz (300 g) mixed tomatoes</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 shallot, finely chopped</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ cup (100 ml) kalamata olives</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">16 <span class="italic">boquerones</span> (see <a href="../Text/007_Chapter003.html#page_143">page 143</a>) or sardine fillets</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">4 eggs, boiled for 4 minutes (see opposite page)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">salt, freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">DRESSING:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">⅓ cup olive oil</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tsp Dijon mustard</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tsp dry sherry or white wine (optional)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tsp honey</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ lemon, juice</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tbsp water</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">¼ tsp salt</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Boil the potatoes in salted water. Add the haricot verts at the end of the cooking process and let them boil for a few minutes. Cut the tomatoes, potatoes, and haricot verts into various-sized pieces. Cut the eggs in half and put to the side.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Put all the ingredients for the dressing into a jar and close the lid. Shake vigorously. This is a great way to make and store dressing without any mess.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Drizzle the dressing on top of the tomatoes, potatoes, and haricot verts, and fold all of it around until every piece is coated with the dressing. Perhaps puncture some of the tomatoes and let the tomato juice mix with the dressing. Arrange the salad on individual plates or on a large serving platter. Add the egg halves and drizzle some more dressing on top. The salad tastes the best when the potatoes are still a little warm.</p>

  <p class="h2a">40. Shrimp Salad with Salted Cucumber and Lemon Mayo</p>

  <p class="noindentl">A shrimp salad with Tore Wretman’s signature Rhode Island dressing will <span class="italic">not</span> be found here! I like everything Tore has made… except for that sauce. It might be a bit of a challenge to make my own version of his classic, but I’m going to try. My shrimp salad has salted cucumber and, of course, mayo—although this mayo is a bit more acidic than most.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2½ lbs (1.2 kg) shrimp with shells (2¼ lbs [1 kg] peeled)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ leek or a couple of spring onions</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">lettuce of your choice</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">4 eggs, boiled for 4 minutes (see opposite page)</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">LIGHTLY SALTED CUCUMBER:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 cucumber</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tsp salt</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tsp sugar</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">LEMON MAYO:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1–2 tsp mustard</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 egg yolks</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 lemon, zest + 1 tbsp juice</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1¼ cups (300 ml) oil, (for example, canola oil)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">¼ tsp salt</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><a id="page_94"/><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Peel the shrimp and place them somewhere cold. You can save the shells and make shrimp bisque with sherry cream (see <a href="../Text/007_Chapter003.html#page_94">page 94</a>).</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Rinse the leek and slice it diagonally as thinly as you can.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Peel the cucumber and cut it into ½-inch (1 cm) thick slices. Place the slices in a plastic bag and pour in the salt and sugar. Shake and let the cucumber rest for 15 minutes at room temperature. If the cucumber becomes too salty, you can just rinse it under water.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Mix mustard, egg yolks, lemon juice, and zest. Drip a little bit of oil into the mixture at a time while whisking constantly. Season with salt and pepper.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   Arrange the salad, shrimp, and eggs on a serving plate or on individual plates and drizzle the lemon mayo on top. Serve with some fresh bread.</p>

  <p class="h2a">41. Perfect Eggs with Fillings</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Perfect as a quick lunch snack with some delicious fillings.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">8 eggs at room temperature</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">FILLINGS:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">• 1 can of mackerel in tomato sauce</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Place the eggs in a pot of cold water and let the water boil. Once the water begins to boil, the eggs should cook for exactly 4 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Drain the water and rinse the eggs in cold water until they cool down.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Cut the top off of each egg and garnish with any filling you like.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/93-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">GRANDMA’S PERFECT EGGS</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="italic">My grandma was the best at boiling eggs. She always put the eggs in cold water, set it to a boil, and then boiled the eggs for exactly 4 minutes.</span></p>

  <p class="h2a"><a id="page_95"/>42. Shrimp Bisque with Sherry Cream</p>

  <p class="noindentl">When I was young, my dad used to roast the shrimp shells at Ramlösa Tavern—and it stunk to high heaven! When we were supposed to actually <span class="italic">eat</span> the results of the roasted shells, I thought I would be sick to my stomach. I pledged never to eat anything remotely close to shrimp bisque ever in my life. It’s wasn’t until now that I’ve finally made peace with roasted shrimp shells.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2¼ lbs (1 kg) shrimp</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">butter and oil for sautéing</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tbsp tomato paste</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ tsp cayenne pepper</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tsp paprika powder</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 yellow onion, chopped + 1 carrot, chopped</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 ½ quarts (1½ liters) water</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1¼ cup (300 ml) crème fraîche (if this cannot be found, a fatty sour cream can be substituted)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">salt, freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">SHERRY CREAM:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ cup (100 ml) heavy cream, whipped fairly firm</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tsp sherry</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">a pinch of salt</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Peel half of the shrimp.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Heat some of the butter and oil in a large pot. Add the tomato paste and the spices along with the unpeeled shrimp and the shells from the peeled shrimp. Sauté for about 10 minutes while stirring constantly to ensure that it does not burn. Add the water and let it simmer uncovered for about 20 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Mix the soup right in the pot with a hand blender. Strain the soup a little at a time by pressing it through a sieve with a spoon. This will take some time but the taste will be worth it in the end.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Let the bisque simmer once more in the pot and add the crème fraîche. Season with salt and pepper. Mix the heavy cream with sherry and salt.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   Serve the bisque hot, garnished with some sherry cream and shrimp. Serve with some grissini (see <a href="../Text/011_Chapter007.html#page_269">page 269</a>).</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">ROAST THE SHELLS</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Be sure to thoroughly roast the shrimp shells, as they’re what give the bisque its great flavor. Roasting the tomato paste is mostly for obtaining that lovely color, but it also makes some of that sticky tomato taste disappear.</span></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">MY SHRIMP STOCK</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindentl">Bouillon or broth—this beloved child has many names. Many things that end up in soups make a great stock, such as the shrimp shells. Adding plenty of butter to the stock is a good chef trick. The butter will float to the surface and can then be skimmed off. This you can chill and use as a delicious shrimp butter, or when melted, you can drizzle it over soup or vegetables for extra flavor. Use the stock for fish soups or sauces for fish.</p>

  <p class="hanga1"><span class="italic">1 stick + 2 tbsp (150 g) butter</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 lbs (1 kg) frozen shrimp</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tbsp tomato paste</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 fennel, chopped</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">¼ celeriac, chopped + 1 parsnip, chopped</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 yellow onions, chopped + 1 head of garlic, halved</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3 bay leaves + 1 tsp thyme</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">5 black peppercorns</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">water</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">salt, freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">In a pot, heat the butter and let it turn golden yellow. Add shrimp and tomato paste. Roast thoroughly. Add vegetables, onion, garlic, and spices, and cover it all with water. Let simmer for 20–25 minutes and season with salt and pepper.</p>

  <p class="h2a"><a id="page_98"/>43. Clam Chowder</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Cockles (or saltwater clams) are also called Vongole clams or <span class="italic">Amandes des mer</span> in French. The meat of the elongated razor clam is also delicious, and you can even exchange the saltwater clams for sea mussels, if you like them better. Just make sure not to add them until the very end, as they should only cook for about five minutes. You will, of course, have to change the name of the soup to “sea mussel soup” if you do!</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3 tbsp (40 g) butter</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 head of garlic, halved</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 sprig of parsley</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 lbs (1 kg) saltwater clams or razor clams</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">¾ cup (200 ml) water</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">5 oz (150 g) bacon</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 large silver onion, finely chopped</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 garlic cloves, coarsely chopped</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tbsp olive oil</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2–3 bay leaves</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">17 oz (500 g) potatoes, cut in large pieces</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3½ oz (100 g) celery root, cubed</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ fennel, in strips</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">¾ cup (200 ml) white wine</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3 cups (700 ml) water</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ cup (100 ml) heavy cream + ½ cup (100 ml) crème fraîche (if this cannot be found, a fatty sour cream can be substituted)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">¾ cup (200 ml) finely chopped parsley</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ tsp salt</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">¼ tsp freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">lemon for serving</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Heat the butter, garlic, parsley, clams, and ¾ cup (200 ml) water in a covered pot on medium heat for 2–3 minutes or until the clams open. Put the pot and its contents aside.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Fry the bacon, onion, and plenty of garlic in olive oil in another pot on low heat for about 10 minutes until the bacon is slightly crisp. Add bay leaves, potatoes, celery root, fennel, and wine. Let it simmer for 2–3 minutes. Add water, heavy cream, and crème fraîche, and let simmer for another 20–25 minutes until the potatoes begin to soften.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Add the clams with the stock to the soup and season with chopped parsley, salt, and pepper. Serve with a lemon wedge so guests can squeeze the fresh juice directly on top.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">STRAIN AWAY THE GRIT</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindentl"><span class="italic">Saltwater clams can have a lot of sand and stones stuck inside, so make sure you strain the stock through a cloth. Or put the clams in cold water so they have a chance to “spit out” all the sand. Just stir and change the water a couple of times.</span></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">MY FISH STOCK</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindentl">It’s probably not every day you have a whole fish on your hands, but on the days when you do, it’s good to know what to do with it. Homemade fish stock does wonders for fish soups and sauces. You basically exchange the amount of water in the recipe for your homemade stock. Freeze the stock and use it for both everyday meals and for special occasions.</p>

  <p class="hanga1"><span class="italic">2 lbs (1 kg) fish bones and heads, preferably from flatfish</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 yellow onion, sliced + 1 fennel, sliced</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">5–7 white peppercorns, coarsely crushed</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2–3 sprigs parsley</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 sprigs fresh thyme (or ½ tsp dried)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3–4 bay leaves</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">water</span></p>

  <p class="noindentl">This beloved fish has many names: snapper, sea bream, gilthead. It’s a great everyday fish that’s becoming more and more popular in supermarkets. They live in the Atlantic Ocean and in the Mediterranean and are perfect for grilling. Make sure to salt liberally since the meat is really firm. And miso—what really is that? Well, it’s just fermented soybeans.</p>

  <p class="noindentl">This photo of the turbot was one of the first we took for this book. We had bought the most beautiful and expensive turbot in the store and roasted it in our “shitty” old oven (pardon my language!). And it turned out so damn tasty! Even at this stage in my life, having cooked so much fish, I’m still amazed by how easy it is to cook great-tasting fish. And when they try this sauce, your guests will be impressed—guaranteed. Try other flatfish as well, such as sole and flounder.</p>

    <p class="h2b"><span class="italic">Minced Fish—Several Dishes</span></p>

    <p class="noindent">I can’t recall Mom, Dad, or Grandma ever mincing fish. No, this inspiration comes from our neighbors at number 28, who I visited every other day. This comes from one of those days when I stopped by, and dinner was pasta with canned fish balls in white sauce.… My reaction wasn’t exactly negative, but more along the lines of, “What? Do people really eat this kind of stuff?” When I encounter things like this, I get inspired. So I decided to make minced fish that tastes better! With a food processor, mincing becomes a really quick process, too. And I’ll never forget that time I made minced white fish from frozen pollock and cod, seasoned it with salt and pepper, and crumb-coated it with panko breadcrumbs. I pan-fried the minced fish in butter and served it with cucumber salad. The kids stuffed themselves until they couldn’t stand up! Here is one of my so-called “basic recipes,” which can be used as a base for anything by adding pretty much any spices and ingredients you like to create a completely new dish—just from using a simple, delicious fish to start. And for when you manage to catch plenty of fish on your hook, this fish mince can be used to make both fish burgers and quenelles.</p>

    <p class="h2a"><a id="page_108"/>49. Basic Fish Mince Recipe</p>

    <p class="noindentl">It’s important not to mix the ingredients for too long as this can cause the fat to separate from the mince and it will become mealy.</p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 stick + 2½ tbsp (150 g) butter, room temperature</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ cup (100 ml) heavy cream</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">salt, freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Mix the lingonberries with sugar and cognac. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for 1–2 days until the sugar has melted. Add more sugar or cognac if needed.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Boil the potatoes in lightly salted water. Press the potatoes in a potato ricer and stir in the room-temperature butter. Add heavy cream and season with salt and pepper.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Cut off the herring fins and spread out the fillets. Spread mustard on top. Sprinkle with dill, and season each fillet with salt and pepper. Fold them back up lengthwise. Pour rye flour onto a plate and coat the fillets with the flour. Pan-fry the fillets in butter for 4–5 minutes on each side until they turn golden brown and crispy.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Serve right away with mashed potatoes and cognac lingonberries.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">LINGONBERRIES</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Don’t stir the lingonberries or cranberries too much; instead, let the sugar melt slowly. The best thing to do is to mix everything the night before and cover the bowl in plastic wrap. Then, just let it sit on the kitchen counter. If you’re the forgetful kind—just like me—you can also heat them in a pot, carefully, to make sure they stay intact. If you don’t have any fresh lingonberries, you can also flavor store-bought lingonberry preserves with some cognac and lemon zest.</span></p>

  <p class="noindentl">At Cirkus Maximum in Östhammar, I was cooking with a pregnant belly beside journalist Pelle Westman. I was preparing fish ’n’ chips served up on newspaper—just the way it’s meant to be served. This utterly British dish is like a Swedish shrimp salad sandwich… it can turn out so incredibly delicious or it can be an absolute disaster. If you have the right touch and clean oil in the fryer, I promise you it will turn out great.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">8 flounder fillets (approx. 1 ⅓ lbs [600 g])</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 cups (½ liter) corn oil for frying</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">FOR SERVING:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">lemon wedges</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Chop the pickles for the sauce. Rinse the leek and slice it thinly. Mix the pickles, leek, mayo, and crème fraîche (or sour cream) in a bowl. Stir in the curry powder. Season the sauce with salt and pepper and a little bit of lemon juice. Finish it off with the shredded fresh horseradish. If you don’t want to use store-bought mayonnaise, you can make your own using the recipe on <a href="../Text/007_Chapter003.html#page_109">page 109</a>.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Whisk the eggs and cornstarch until you have a smooth batter. Heat plenty of oil in a pot (read more about deep frying on <a href="../Text/010_Chapter006.html#page_248">page 248</a>). Season the flounder fillets with salt and pepper. First dip them in the batter, and then place them in the hot oil for 3–4 minutes until they curl and turn golden brown. Dip the parsley sprigs into the batter and fry them quickly.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Serve with remoulade sauce and lemon wedges—perhaps even cut them like the Russian lemon (see <a href="../Text/009_Chapter005.html#page_188">page 188</a>). This, of course, tastes great with crispy french fries. And go for it—serve it on a sheet of newspaper!</p>

  <p class="noindentl">When I grew up in the ’80s, this dish was typical of the food my dad made in the restaurant. Dollops of whipped cream in soups, pressed potatoes, and beef tenderloin “black and white.” Today, I’m happy to have been a restaurant child, but back in those days I didn’t know what a gift it was! My brother and I preferred to stay with my grandmother and grandfather, where we were served regular food instead of strange luxuries we didn’t even like. Time to bring out your old braiding techniques, because we’re making a fish braid! And add the champagne sauce to your favorites, because it’s great with any type of fish. It’s just a fancier type of white wine sauce.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Cut the fish fillets lengthwise into thick strips. Braid the fish into four braids. Put them on lightly buttered parchment paper and bake in the oven for about 10 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Peel and thinly slice the onion. Crush the peppercorn. Fry the onion and the peppercorns in butter. Add white wine, stock, and 3½ tbsp sparkling wine and reduce to half its volume. Add the cream and let it reduce some more until the sauce becomes nice and creamy. Sift the sauce through a sieve. Season with salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Keep the sauce hot until ready to serve.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Heat the sweet peas gently in a pot with a few tablespoons of the sauce. Pour the peas onto four plates and place one fish braid on each plate. Garnish with salmon roe and chives.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   Add another 3½ tbsp of sparkling wine to the sauce and make it frothier by mixing with a hand mixer right in the pot.</p>

  <p class="nlist">6.   Serve the fish braid right away with the champagne sauce and pressed potatoes. Don’t forget a large dollop of butter on top of the pressed potatoes, along with salt and freshly ground pepper.</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Now I’m going to tell you about a sauce that is really diverse—almost like a chameleon that changes its appearance faster than Clark Kent becomes Superman. One day he’s lying down (I’m sure it’s a he) on a spoon with Mrs. Flounder, and the next day he’s playing billiards with the best quality sirloin steak. I’m talking about a sauce called salsa verde in Italian and Spanish, and it works with everything, even tacos (see <a href="../Text/010_Chapter006.html#page_248">page 248</a>), and is a great summer sidekick. Here, the sauce is accompanied by char, but don’t let that limit you. You can forget about the fish and enjoy the sauce.… No, all jokes aside, I do think the pickled char deserves its own recognition, as it is a simple fish that’s very easy to find culinary success with.</p>

    <p class="h2b"><span class="italic">In Top Shape—Everyday in a Can</span></p>

    <p class="noindent">Time for some product placement and canned nostalgia! Many consider fish casserole a more advanced level of cooking, and probably not something to be made on a regular weekday. But on the weekdays we need shortcuts, and I have plenty of shortcuts in my kitchen! Fish casserole is healthy and tasty, but best of all, it cooks itself in the oven. I’ll show you how you can turn fresh or frozen fish into simple and tasty everyday food, just by using Campbell’s canned soups. I love simple and great solutions, and this is why I don’t think there’s anything wrong with canned sauces and soups (as long as they taste good). And that’s what I like about Campbell’s. Using their soups for anything and everything is not only a tasty option, but also a smart one. So stop closing the kitchen curtains when you open a can of soup! It’s cool to use half-finished products, if you do it the right way. Stock up on some soups and add anything from salmon to cod, mackerel to flounder. And just think about what a lovely stack of soups you’ll have in the pantry.</p>

    <p class="h2a"><a id="page_120"/>56. Flounder in Lobster Au Gratin with Broccoli and Zucchini</p>

    <p class="noindentl">I made this casserole once during a downpour at Marstrand during a taping for my TV show with Tomas Tengby. It has almost been ten years since then, but I still make this dish once a week, either on a weekday or on a Saturday. And remember this: if the Fussy Family comes to visit, it’s perfectly okay to say that you made the lobster soup from scratch.</p>

    <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

    <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">8 flounder fillets</span></p>

    <p class="nlist">1.   Preheat the oven to 475ºF (250ºC).</p>

    <p class="nlist">2.   Season the fillets with salt and pepper and roll them up so the skin is on the inside. Put the rolls in a baking dish.</p>

    <p class="nlist">3.   Slice the zucchini and broccoli stems. Break the broccoli head into small pieces. Sauté the vegetables and garlic in a pan with olive oil for a few minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</p>

    <p class="nlist">4.   Pour the vegetables into the pan with the fish. Mix the soup with half a can of milk, water, or heavy cream and pour it over the vegetables and fish. Bake in the oven for about 10 minutes.</p>

    <p class="nlist">5.   Whisk the heavy cream and stir in the egg yolk. Dollop the whipped cream onto the baked fish. Bake in the oven for another 5 minutes. Serve with pressed potatoes or rice (see <a href="../Text/009_Chapter005.html#page_236">page 236</a>).</p>

    <p class="h2a">57. Cod in Asparagus Au Gratin with Sweet Peas and Lemon</p>

    <p class="noindentl">I love making casseroles with heavy cream because it tastes so much better. If you buy fresh cod, be sure to have it cleaned and filleted for you at the fish counter so it will be free of bones.</p>

    <p class="nlist">1.   Preheat the oven to 475ºF (250ºC). Clean the cod fillets by removing the small bones attached to the thickest part of the fillets. This will make the fillet open up, and it will look like a pair of pants. Put the fish in a baking fish and squeeze lemon on top. Season with salt and pepper.</p>

    <p class="nlist">2.   Clean the leek and sweet peas and cut into smaller pieces. Cut off the bottom part of the asparagus and throw it away; chop up the rest of the stem. Sauté the vegetables in a pan with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Pour the vegetables into the pan.</p>

    <p class="noindent">It’s always a good idea to salt the fish if it has been frozen and then let it rest for about fifteen minutes before working with it. That way, the fish won’t release as much liquid during the cooking process and will be firmer in texture.</p>

  <p class="noindentl">This is a perfect summer food made from leftovers. Depending on where you live, new potatoes can be called “early potatoes,” but they’re all the same. Just crush yesterday’s leftover cold potatoes with a fork and add Kalles Kaviar and cream—so incredibly delicious! Kalles Kaviar spread is an everyday, spreadable caviar that can be found at IKEA. You can also make this dish without the salmon and just eat it as is, perhaps with some hard-boiled eggs cut into halves. If so, you can also omit the cheese and place it in the oven. It’s a perfect “I-have-nothing-at-home dish.” Lightly salted cucumber (see <a href="../Text/010_Chapter006.html#page_252">page 252</a>) goes really well with it.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">14 oz (400 g) boiled potatoes</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1⅓ lbs (600 g) salmon fillets, without skin</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Whisk the heavy cream and flavor it with caviar. Season with pepper. Spread out the caviar crème in the pan so it covers the fish and potatoes. Sprinkle shredded cheese on top and bake in the oven for 15 minutes.</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Serve this dish as an appetizer or as a main course with boiled potatoes. The salmon becomes a little sweet in flavor because of the onion. It’s really simple to make and tastes great!</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">14 oz (400 g) fresh salmon fillet</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">a pinch of white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Peel and finely chop the onions. Flash-fry them in a pan with a little bit of oil until they turn soft.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Zest one lime and squeeze the juice out of all three. Add both juice and zest to the pan with the onion. Add honey and olive oil. Bring to a boil and let simmer until the vinaigrette thickens slightly.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Slice the salmon as thin as you can and divide the slices onto four plates. Season with salt and pepper. Pour the warm vinaigrette on top of the raw salmon and serve right away.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">DIFFERENT WAYS TO CUT SALMON</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="italic">If you want extra thin slices, place the salmon in the freezer for a short period because this makes it easier to cut the salmon really thin. Or you can just forget the traditional way of cutting salmon diagonally and simply cut it straight down as if you were slicing bread. Just be sure it doesn’t have any skin still attached before you do.</span></p>

  <p class="h2a">63. Salmon with Warm Grapes and Capers</p>

  <p class="noindentl">I had this salmon dish with my colleague Benny at La Boqueria in Barcelona. The grapes were close to bursting. We gurgled and snacked while trying to figure this recipe out, and this is what we came up with. The grape brine with capers is also delicious when eaten chilled with some cold cuts.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">14 oz (400 g) fresh salmon fillet</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3½ tbsp olive oil</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tbsp white balsamic vinegar</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">a pinch of freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Place the onions in a warm pot with olive oil and white balsamic vinegar. Add grapes and capers and let simmer for seven minutes, until the grapes have turned soft and juicy. Cover the pot if you want to speed up the process.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Slice the salmon as thinly as possible and divide the slices onto four individual plates. Season with salt and pepper and spread out the warm grapes over the raw salmon. Serve right away.</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Making gravlax is easy, because it makes itself. It’s both fun and simple, and you really can’t go wrong. If you just make sure to roll the salmon around in the spices once in a while, keeping your hands clean and the salmon cold, you’ll be successful, I promise!</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4–6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Grind the bay leaves and white pepper in a mortar. Wash and cut the lemon into thin slices.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Mix the sugar, salt, and dill with the ground bay leaves and white pepper. Rub the salmon with the spice mix and then cover the whole fish with lemon slices. Let it rest at room temperature until the mixture begins to melt; it takes about an hour.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Place the salmon in the fridge covered in plastic wrap and preferably under a little bit of pressure. Let it rest for at least twenty-four hours.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Cut the salmon either diagonally or straight down (like a loaf of bread) into thin slices. Serve as a main dish with creamy dill potatoes (see <a href="../Text/007_Chapter003.html#page_124">page 124</a>) or at a buffet.</p>

    <p class="h2b"><span class="italic">A Net Full of Mussels—Four Fabulous Recipes</span></p>

    <p class="noindent">Blue mussels are festive, delicious, useful, and best of all, they’re cheap. They cook really quickly as well. Serve them steamed; au gratin; seasoned with chili, lime, and coconut milk; or seasoned with cinnamon and cardamom. Try a number of flavors so you can have a reason to eat mussels more often!</p>

    <p class="indent">It’s important that the mussels be alive, and you can confirm this by tapping on the open mussels. The ones that close their lids can be eaten; the ones that don’t should be thrown away. The best season for mussels is the spring, before they start their mating season. It’s said that you shouldn’t eat shellfish during months that don’t have the letter “R” in their name. Here are my favorite blue mussel recipes. So for those of you who have only cooked these in white wine, see how easy it is to vary the flavors and be inspired to try something new!</p>

  <p class="h2a">73. Spicy Ramlösa Atlantic Herring</p>

  <p class="noindentl">I created this recipe while I was working at IKEA many years ago. I don’t think I’ve ever gotten more requests for any other recipe before or since. I actually didn’t have the recipe until now.… At IKEA we measured the herring in tons, and we didn’t have a recipe for individual portions. I always make the Ramlösa herring for Christmas and bring the leftovers to our vacation home for New Year’s Eve. It tastes even better then.</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Breading the pickled herring with rye flour is my specialty, after having been in charge of the pan frying of herring at Ramlösa Tavern. Dad used to have a huge frying table that could probably fit a hundred herrings—so you had to move quickly!</p>
