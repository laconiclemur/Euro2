<h1 class="chapter">pheasant soup</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>Game birds are hunted in season in the Tuscan woods and have been a part of the diet since Etruscan days. This is full of woodsy flavour and we love the contrast of textures of the smooth soup with the crumbly chestnuts. The finished soup is thick and works brilliantly if poured into one side of a shallow bowl with the <a href="9781784881757_Split86.html#page_146">Creamy Bean Soup</a> poured into the other side (see picture opposite).</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 6–8 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil or chicken fat</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 shallot, peeled and finely chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 celery stalk, finely chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 teaspoon salt</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>300 g (10½ oz) potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 cm (½ in) dice</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>220–250 g (8–9 oz) pheasant meat leftover from making the <a href="9781784881757_Split18.html#page_35">Pheasant Stock</a>, roughly torn into bite-sized pieces</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>6 juniper berries, finely crushed in a pestle and mortar</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>100 ml (3½ fl oz/scant ½ cup) white wine</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1.5 litres (2½ pints/6½ cups) <a href="9781784881757_Split18.html#page_35">Pheasant Stock</a></b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>3 tablespoons double (heavy) cream</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>120 g (4 oz) cooked and peeled chestnuts, crumbled</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>good-quality extra-virgin olive oil, to serve</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Heat the oil or fat in a large saucepan over a low heat. Add the shallot and celery, and fry gently for about 10 minutes or until soft and translucent. Add the salt and some pepper with the diced potato, 150 g (5 oz) of the pheasant meat and the crushed juniper berries, and stir through. Fry for a few minutes, then add the wine and stock. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for around 30 minutes until the potato is soft.</p>
<p class="tx">Remove from the heat and blend with a stick blender, then add the cream, the remaining meat and the chestnuts, reserving a few for decoration.</p>
<p class="tx">Bring the soup back to a gentle simmer and taste again for seasoning. The soup should be thick and creamy. If it is too thin for your liking continue to cook and reduce it for up to 30 minutes. Serve warm with a twist of black pepper, the remaining chestnuts and a swirl of olive oil.</p>
