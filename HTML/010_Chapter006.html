    <p class="noindent1"><a id="page_243"/><span class="small">TEX-MEX IS WHAT WE CALL</span> American food that draws inspiration from Texas and Mexico. Typically this includes tortillas, fajitas, nachos, tacos, salsa, guacamole, and beans. Funnily enough, Norwegians and my native Swedes eat the most Tex-Mex of all Europeans. How did that happen?</p>

    <p class="indent">One reason might be that one of Sweden’s biggest supermarkets decided to emphasize their exotic product lines, and after about six years of heavy marketing, us Swedes were hooked. Now we appreciate the many flavors and diverse uses of corn, as well as the admirable relationship between avocado, ground beef, cumin, oregano, and peppers. Tacos are the Mexican equivalent to the Swedish smörgåsbord. Swedes love to handpick their own food for their plates, buffet-style, and we revel in the many different flavors we can choose from. But one big difference between tacos and the smörgåsbord is that up until now most people have enjoyed their tacos while wearing their sweatpants! Now it’s time to take our cherished taco dinners to a whole new level, so ditch those sweatpants and try something a bit more daring!</p>

    <p class="indent">Here is a whole plethora of updated tacos to choose from. Different meats—chicken, duck, fish, and even vegetarian—along with all kinds of sauces and toppings. Everything in this chapter is easy to make, though some of the recipes have a lengthy prep time.</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_1"><a id="page_244"/>141. Tortillas</p>

  <p class="noindentl">This might seem a little ambitious, but it’s a lot of fun to bake your own tortillas when you have some spare time. And it makes a huge difference! The tortillas are fluffy and not as compact as the ones you buy in the store, and I like the little burnt bits here and there. Try to bake it in a panini press.</p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">8 PIECES OF BREAD</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ oz (12 g) active dry yeast</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 cup (250 ml) water, room temperature</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ tsp salt</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2½ cups (600 ml) flour</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">corn oil for sautéing</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   In a bowl, dissolve the yeast in a little bit of the water. Gradually add the rest of the water with the flour and salt. Mix until the dough is smooth, and let it rise under a kitchen towel for 30 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Divide the dough into 8 small pieces and roll them into balls. Flatten them with a rolling pin until they are ¼ inch (½ cm) thick.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Pan-fry the bread in some corn oil for a few minutes per side.</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_2">142. Salsa</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Not much to mention here—salsa is a must for any classic taco! Make sure you get the seasoning right so you get the desired flavor. If you want it more spicy, just add some more cayenne pepper. Make a large batch of salsa to snack on later; it keeps in the fridge for 10–14 days and tastes better after it’s been allowed to sit for a time.</p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">APPROX. 2 CUPS (500 ML)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 shallot, thinly sliced</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3 garlic cloves, crushed</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">⅓ cup (75 ml) olive oil</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3 tbsp dried oregano</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1½ tbsp paprika powder</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tbsp ground cumin</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">¼ tsp cayenne pepper</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1½ tsp salt</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 box cherry tomatoes (approx. 9 oz [250 g])</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 can crushed tomatoes (14 oz/400 g)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ cup (100 ml) white wine vinegar</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Pan-fry the onion, garlic, and spices in half of the olive oil. Add all other ingredients and let simmer over low heat for 10–15 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Mash the salsa coarsely with a fork or mortar and pestle. If possible, let the sauce rest in the fridge for 24 hours before serving.</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_3">143. Taco Spice Mix</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Use the taco spice mix for classic tacos made of ground beef, salsa, tortillas, and sour cream. Use 2 tbsp taco spice mix per ¾–1 pound (400–500 g) of ground beef.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">APPROX. ½ (200 ML) CUP</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3 tbsp cumin</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tbsp Ancho chili powder</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tsp chili flakes</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tsp garlic powder</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3 tsp dried oregano</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3 tsp dried coriander</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ tsp cayenne pepper</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tsp salt</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tsp sugar</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Grind the spices in a mortar and pestle. Store the spice mix in a jar with a tightly closed lid.</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_4"><a id="page_247"/>144. Ground Beef, Feta, and Capers with Russian Walnut Dip</p>

  <p class="noindentl">This recipe was actually concocted by mistake. While we were sautéing the ground beef, we put the cheese to the side of the pan to make sure it wouldn’t melt—which is exactly what happened. And the dish turned out better than we could ever have imagined! Serve any extras from this dish with some leftover Moroccan rice (see <a href="../Text/009_Chapter005.html#page_236">page 236</a>), and you’ll have a whole new meal.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4–6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">14 oz (400 g) ground beef</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1½ tbsp capers</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3½ oz (100 g) feta cheese</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">⅔ cup (150 ml) walnuts</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">olive oil for sautéing</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1½ tbsp Dijon mustard</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ tsp salt</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">freshly ground white or black pepper</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">FOR SERVING:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">tortillas (see <a href="../Text/010_Chapter006.html#page_243">page 243</a>)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">Russian walnut dip (see <a href="../Text/010_Chapter006.html#page_251">page 251</a>)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">shredded carrot</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">leek, thinly sliced</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Coarsely chop the capers. Crumble the feta cheese. Finely chop the walnuts and sauté them in a frying pan with olive oil. Add ground beef, capers, feta cheese, and mustard. Season with salt and freshly ground white or black pepper. Serve the meat on tortilla bread with the shredded carrot and leeks. Top with the Russian walnut dip.</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_5">145. Pulled Pork with Hoisin Sauce and Chili-roasted Corn</p>

  <p class="noindentl">This is easiest dish in the world to make! I simply put the pot in the oven, brush my teeth, and go off to bed. By the time I’m sipping my morning coffee, the pulled pork is done. It’s a perfect dish to prepare the day before you’re expecting company. You can just heat it up right before serving. And it’s super-delicious for a lazy Friday night at home.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4–6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3⅓ lbs (1½ kg) whole pork shoulder, de-boned</span></p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_6"><a id="page_248"/>146. Chicken Thighs with Herbed Chickpeas and Green Pea Guacamole</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Another of my favorites! I love when food looks a little disorganized but has the flavor to knock your socks off. Everything in one pot, nutritious and low-maintenance to boost.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4–6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">4 chicken thighs, with skin</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Add chickpeas and spices along with the water from the chickpeas so that every-thing is almost covered. Bring to a boil and let simmer over low heat for about 2 hours. (The bouillon should have almost completely evaporated).</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Remove the chicken and pull the meat off the bones. Fold the meat into the chickpea mix and season with salt and pepper.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Serve on tortillas with green pea guacamole.</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_7">147. Roasted Duck and Radish with Hoisin Sauce on Chinese Pancakes</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Can you really serve something as fancy as duck on a pancake? You bet! Everyone will love it so much that they’ll be cartwheeling around you!</p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1⅔ cups (400 ml) flour</span></p>

Let them rest for a few minutes and then cut into slices before serving.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Mix the pancake batter and fry the pancakes in butter over low heat. They’re supposed to be pale in color and very thin.</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_8"><a id="page_249"/>148. Tempura-style Flounder with Salted Cucumber and Sour Cream</p>

  <p class="noindentl">I made this flounder once at the Torekov camp grounds for several hundred campers. The tortillas were made over an open flame. The flounder should be served straight from the fryer. Feel free to drizzle some vinegar on top when serving; it will neutralize the fatty oil.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">4 flounder fillets (approx. 4½ oz [125 g] per person)</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Whisk the egg and cornstarch until it becomes a smooth, runny batter. Dip the fish fillets in the batter.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Fry the fish until they are golden brown, for about 2–3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Serve on tortillas with pickled cucumber and sour cream.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">HOW TO DEEP FRY</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Pour the sunflower oil into a deep saucepan and heat it until it reaches a temperature of 350ºF (180ºC). Measure the temperature with a kitchen thermometer or gently place a piece of bread in the oil. If the bread turns brown within one minute, you’ve reached the right temperature. Make sure to keep a lid handy just in case the oil catches fire. NEVER try put out an oil fire with water! And don’t fry too much at a time because this will reduce the temperature of the oil. Place the fried strips on paper towels afterward to soak up any excess oil.</span></p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_9">149. White Bean Tacos with Salsa Verde and Vegetable Strips</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_10"><a id="page_252"/>150. Russian Walnut Dip</p>

  <p class="noindentl">I was inspired to make this dip after a trip to Moscow with my colleague, Benny. It’s a completely new kind of sauce to me, loaded with walnuts and a distinct cumin flavor. It’s a match made in heaven with the ground beef, feta, and capers (see <a href="../Text/010_Chapter006.html#page_246">page 246</a>). It’s also amazing with the green chicken tenders (see <a href="../Text/009_Chapter005.html#page_232">page 232</a>) and even makes a tasty dip for bread.</p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">APPROX. 2 CUPS (500 ML)</span></p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_11">151. Hoisin Sauce</p>

  <p class="noindentl">This is my homemade version of the East Asian sauce. It’s flavorful and a little syrupy, with notes of coffee, tahini, and vinegar. It’s perfect for pulled pork. This red sauce is pictured on <a href="../Text/009_Chapter005.html#page_240">page 240</a>, poured into a bottle.</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_12">152. Chili-roasted Corn with Hazelnuts</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Corn is a fun taco side dish, especially mixed with cucumber and chopped tomatoes. This tastes best when the nuts are chopped coarsely, so you can really get their full flavor with each bite. Absolutely delectable with pulled pork (see <a href="../Text/010_Chapter006.html#page_246">page 246</a>).</p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">APPROX. 1⅔ CUPS (400 ML)</span></p>

  <p class="noindentl">A favorite dip of mine. It’s also great with grilled salmon (see <a href="../Text/008_Chapter004.html#page_154">page 154</a>). The green peas give the guacamole a sweetness and freshness. It’s also a great topping on spicy sausage pizza.</p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">APPROX. 2 CUPS (500 ML)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 avocados</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 cups (500 ml) green peas</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tbsp sour cream</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tbsp olive oil</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1–2 garlic cloves</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ tsp (or less) salt</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">5 dashes of green Tabasco</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Halve the avocados. Remove the pits and scrape the avocado flesh from the skins. Coarsely mash together the peas, avocado, sour cream, and olive oil. Shred the garlic into the mixture and stir. Season with salt and Tabasco.</p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_14">154. Salted Cucumber</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Quick and easy to make. The salt makes the cucumber crunchy and with the skin peeled away it looks even prettier. Salted cucumber is also delicious in salads.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 cucumber</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ tsp salt</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Peel and core the cucumber. Slice it diagonally and put the slices into a plastic bag. Pour the salt into the bag and shake. Let it rest for 10–15 minutes before serving. You can also put the cucumber slices in a bowl and combine it that way, but this will take longer.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">WARM CUCUMBER WITH DILL</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindentl"><span class="italic">Heat the cucumber with a pat of butter and some dill and mix with steamed vegetables. Amazing what you can do with a simple cucumber!</span></p>

  <p class="h2a" id="h2a_15">155. Salsa Verde</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Salsa verde is an Italian and Spanish sauce that’s easy to overlook, but it’s great with almost anything. And that’s why you can find this recipe next to the pickled char on <a href="../Text/007_Chapter003.html#page_117">page 117</a>. It’s also great with bean tacos (see <a href="../Text/010_Chapter006.html#page_248">page 248</a>) and with smoked salmon and new potatoes, or as a salad dressing.</p>
