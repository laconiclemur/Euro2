 <p class="flush_left_large"><a id="pg_472"/>Thanks to the sunshine, Spain is blessed with so much exquisite fruit and for me it makes the best end to a meal. When I lived in Catalunya I got used to being offered <em>fruta del día</em>, fresh fruit of the day, or a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice as a simple dessert in local restaurants. A remarkably sensible burst of vitamins after a good lunch or dinner.</p>
<p class="indented_large">And what a spectrum of fruit there is to choose from, since Spanish territories span such a wide variety of climates, from the tropics of the Canaries, where you find bananas and paw paw, to the forests of central Spain, where in summer wild <em>grosellas</em> (redcurrants), <em>frambuesas</em> (raspberries), <em>moras</em> (blackberries) and <em>fresas</em> (wild strawberries) grow, and in autumn, <em>zarzamoras (</em>blackberries) and <em>arándanos</em> (blueberries). The central and eastern regions of Castilla y León, La Rioja, the Ebro valley in Navarra, Aragón and Catalunya are also famous for their orchard fruits: cherries, quinces, plums, peaches, figs, pears and apples. And in the south and in Valencia, alongside oranges, brilliant red persimmons (like sweet and fruity tomatoes) have their own PDO, and are excellent mixed with yogurt, or you can just eat them like passion fruit, digging into their juicy interior with a small spoon. Fruits such as pears and peaches are typically poached in wine, and oranges or strawberries are outstanding macerated for a few hours with some sugar and vanilla.</p>
<p class="indented_large">At one time in Catalunya it was traditional for innkeepers to ‘pay’ minstrels who performed in their establishments with a ‘musician’s dessert’ of dried fruit and nuts and a glass of sweet wine. The idea always makes me think of the children’s story of Trubloff the mouse, who ran away from his family in his village in Russia to play the balalaika with a travelling band of gypsies, performing in inns and receiving food and drink in return. I imagine Trubloff and his Catalan counterparts would enjoy the simple combination of a glass of Casta Diva Moscatel (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_190">here</a>) with some excellent Spanish pine nuts, hazelnuts, almonds, Moscatel sultanas, figs and apricots. Or, as a variation on a traditional theme, <a id="pg_473"/>the fresh combination of pine nuts, oranges, honey and mint on <a href="chapter_005.html#rec192">here</a>.</p>
<p class="indented_large">Other than fruit and nuts, the most typical weekday desserts in Spain tend to be dairy- and egg-based, not unlike our nursery puddings; for example, <em>torrijas</em> (fried milk-soaked squares of bread, see <a href="chapter_005.html#pg_480">here</a>), <em>natillas (</em>set custards), <em>cremas</em> (runny custards) and <em>leche frita</em>: cold custard, allowed to solidify, cut into squares, then fried in butter to a golden colour. Then there are the very rich egg-yolk sweetmeats which often originated in the convents of southern Spain, around the sherry-producing cities. The <em>bodegas</em> would use egg whites to clarify the sherry then give the yolks to the nuns who would use them in delicacies to sell for a little money, such as <em>tocino del cielo</em>, a ‘heavenly’ (but sinfully rich) dessert made with caramel. Or <em>yemas de Santa Teresa</em>, golden-coloured balls of creamy sweetness named after St Teresa of Ávila, founder of the Carmelite convents, which are made with sugared egg yolk, lemon juice and zest and involve a laborious method of overnight baking at a very low temperature.</p>
<p class="indented_large">In various regions of Spain, cheesecakes are popular, and I have given two recipes from the Levante, which use goat’s curd or <em>mató</em> (see <a href="chapter_006.html#pg_525">here</a>). Creamy rice pudding is also a favourite all over Spain, not cooked in the oven so that it forms a roasted brown skin in the way of the traditional British pudding, but gently simmered on the hob, infused with citrus peel and cinnamon, allowed to cool, and served chilled. I have given two versions, which might sound similar but turn out quite differently.</p>
<p class="indented_large">At weekends, when friends and family gather for big meals, there will be more elaborate almond or chocolate tarts, cakes, mousses and ice creams, perhaps made with saffron (<a href="chapter_005.html#rec208">here</a>) or <em>turrón</em> (<a href="chapter_005.html#pg_497">here</a>) depending on the region.</p>
<p class="indented_large">For the selection of recipes in this chapter I have simply homed in on my favourites and some of their many variations.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec191"><a id="pg_474"/>Fresas con vinagre PX y chocolate</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Fresh strawberries with PX vinegar and chocolate</p>
<p class="flush_left">These are fun and colourful.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g strawberries</p>
<p class="ingredients">50ml Pedro Ximénez vinegar</p>
<p class="ingredients">10g butter</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g dark chocolate (at least 70% cocoa solids), broken into squares</p>
<p class="method">Wash and carefully pat dry the strawberries, leaving them whole with the stalks still on.</p>
<p class="method">Pour the vinegar into a pan and let it bubble up until reduced by two-thirds. Take off the heat and leave to cool.</p>
<p class="method">Put the butter into a bowl over a pan of simmering water, taking care not to let the base of the bowl touch the water. Let it melt, then add the chocolate and stir as it melts into the butter. Take off the heat and dip each strawberry into the chocolate (so they are only half covered in chocolate), then place on a rack with the chocolate side upwards and put into the fridge for an hour, until the chocolate has set completely.</p>
<p class="method">Drizzle the vinegar over the strawberries and serve.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec192">Naranja fresca con menta</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Orange carpaccio with fresh mint</p>
<p class="flush_left">In season, navel oranges are excellent combined with the freshness of mint leaves and the creaminess of pine nuts. I also like the oranges simply sliced and drizzled with a dressing of olive oil, orange juice, orange liqueur and a sprinkling of sugar. Choose good Mediterranean pine nuts.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">40g pine nuts</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 ripe oranges</p>
<p class="ingredients">8 fresh mint leaves, finely sliced into strips</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 teaspoons clear neutral honey, such as ‘1000 Flowers’</p>
<p class="method">Toast the pine nuts in a dry pan and allow to cool.</p>
<p class="method">Peel the oranges and remove as much pith as you can, then slice them very finely horizontally, using a sharp knife.</p>
<p class="method">Arrange on a plate or in a bowl, then sprinkle with the mint, drizzle with honey and scatter the pine nuts over the top.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec193"><a id="pg_476"/>Peras al vino con helado de regaliz</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Pears poached in white wine with liquorice ice cream</p>
<p class="flush_left">Pear in red wine is a classic combination across Spain but we wanted a variation on the traditional, so our head chef, Leo, uses white wine to poach the fruit and adds the complementary flavour of liquorice, then serves the pears with liquorice ice cream. The flavour of liquorice reminds him of his childhood, when he and his friends would chew the sweet sticks of natural liquorice known as <em>palo duro</em> or <em>palo dulce</em>, very different to the ‘sweets’ which contain artificial colour and sweeteners. Here you can usually find these in health food shops.</p>
<p class="indented">At home in Catalunya Leo would also use the small round <em>peras de San Juan</em>, which appear in the markets in June for a short season of 30 to 40 days and are crunchy but juicy and sweet. In London we use the larger Conference pears, which work very well.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 medium Conference pears or 8 San Juan pears, peeled</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 bottle (750ml) of fruity white wine such as Albariño or Verdejo</p>
<p class="ingredients">40g sugar</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 stick of natural liquorice root</p>
<p class="ingredients">liquorice ice cream, to serve (see <a href="chapter_005.html#rec208">here</a>)</p>
<p class="method">Put the whole pears into a pan and add the wine, sugar and liquorice root, then lay a sheet of baking paper over the top to trap in all the flavours. Simmer for around 15 minutes, until the pears are tender, testing them occasionally by inserting a skewer.</p>
<p class="method">Lift out the pears, put them into a freezer container and freeze for 30 minutes to halt the cooking process, then transfer to the fridge.</p>
<p class="method">Meanwhile, continue simmering the wine until it has reduced by half, then take off the heat, transfer to a bowl and put into the fridge to cool.</p>
<p class="method">Halve each pear and put into a bowl with a scoop of liquorice ice cream and drizzle with the syrup.</p>

<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_477"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg477.jpg"/></div>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec194">Macedonia con alineo de vainilla y aceite de oliva</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Fruit salad with vanilla and olive oil dressing</p>
<p class="method">Our chef Leo likes to infuse olive oil with a vanilla pod and combine it with juice and honey to make a dressing for a selection of fruit. It makes a good, fresh and healthy finish to a meal, and the combination of olive oil and vanilla is unexpectedly luscious.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">125ml olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 vanilla pod</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 teaspoons honey</p>
<p class="ingredients">juice of 1 orange</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 peaches, cut into small pieces</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g strawberries, quartered</p>
<p class="ingredients">¼ medium melon, cut into small pieces</p>
<p class="method">Pour the oil into a small pan, then slice the vanilla pod lengthways and scrape all the seeds into the oil, as well as adding the halves of the pod. Warm the oil as gently as possible (don’t let it boil) for half an hour, ideally keeping the temperature of the oil below 65°C to prevent the aroma of the vanilla from disappearing. Take off the heat and allow to cool and continue infusing. Any surplus can be stored in a sterilised jar – leave in the vanilla pods – for a week.</p>
<p class="method">Gently heat the honey and orange juice in another small pan until the honey melts. Take off the heat and leave to cool. Mix with the reserved vanilla oil in equal proportions to make the dressing.</p>
<p class="method">Put the fruit into a bowl, pour the dressing over it and allow the flavours to develop at room temperature for an hour before serving.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec195"><a id="pg_478"/>Melocotón caramelizado con helado de Manchego</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Caramelised peach with Manchego ice cream</p>
<p class="flush_left">The perfect ripe peach for this has a beautiful aroma and is properly ripe with generous natural sugars, but still has a slight crunch. Probably the best peaches I have ever eaten have come from Spain, grown in the regions of La Rioja, the Ebro Delta or Calanda in Aragón, where the popular variety is the Amarillo Tardío. These cosseted late-harvest fruits are individually wrapped in paraffin-coated paper bags while still on the tree, to protect them from disease and abrupt climatic shifts through the summer. Out of season, you might also find preserved Calanda peaches, which you can warm through, caramelising them in their own syrup before serving with the ice cream.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 6</p>
<p class="ingredients">6 fresh peaches</p>
<p class="ingredients">300g sugar</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 cloves</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 cinnamon stick</p>
<p class="ingredients">Manchego ice cream, to serve (see <a href="chapter_005.html#rec206">here</a>)</p>
<p class="method">Peel the peaches and put into a small pan with 1 litre of water, the sugar and spices, then cover and cook over a very low heat for 20 minutes, until tender. Take off the heat and allow to cool.</p>
<p class="method">Cut each peach in half and serve with some of the cooking syrup and the ice cream.</p>


<p class="recipe-head" id="rec196"><a id="pg_479"/>Crema catalana</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Catalan burnt custard pudding</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is probably Catalunya’s most famous pudding, so it is impossible to leave it out – and besides, I am a sucker for such milk puddings, so I am always tempted to choose it from a menu.</p>
<p class="indented">It is very close to the French <em>crème brûlée</em>, except, typically of Catalan and Spanish milk-based desserts, it is not cooked in the oven, but on the hob, and as a result tends to be less set and more custardy. A homemade <em>crema catalana</em>, using excellent eggs with deep yellow yolks, and aromatised with lemon and cinnamon, is a world apart from the mass-produced ones, which can often be quite bland in flavour and slightly gelatinous in texture. We like to add vanilla, but Catalan purists wouldn’t do this, so I have made it optional.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 6–8</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 litre milk</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a cinnamon stick</p>
<p class="ingredients">grated rind of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a vanilla pod (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredients">6 large or 8 medium egg yolks</p>
<p class="ingredients">40g cornflour</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g caster sugar</p>
<p class="ingredients">about 1 tablespoon demerara sugar per person</p>
<p class="method">Put the milk into a pan with the cinnamon and lemon rind and, if using, put in the vanilla pod and scrape in the seeds. Heat until the milk starts to rise, then take the pan from the heat, cover, and leave for about 2 hours at room temperature so that the flavours infuse.</p>
<p class="method">In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks, cornflour and sugar. Strain the reserved milk through a fine sieve on to the egg mixture, whisking continuously. Pour into a pan and stir continuously over a low heat until the mixture thickens into a custard. Be careful not to overheat, as the mixture will separate if it reaches more than 80°C.</p>
<p class="method">Pour into small, individual dishes, leave to cool, then put into the fridge for 3–6 hours to set.</p>
<p class="method">Just before serving, sprinkle the top of each dish with demerara sugar and caramelise with a blowtorch or a brûlée iron. Alternatively, put under a preheated, very hot grill, very briefly, making sure the caramel doesn’t burn.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec197"><a id="pg_480"/>Torrijas</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Sugared egg-fried squares</p>
<p class="flush_left">An almost childish Castilian treat, similar to eggy bread or French toast. I made the mistake of mentioning to my chefs at Brindisa that I might not include the recipe, as it is not a usual kind of dessert in the UK, only to be met with a look of anguish on their faces! So here it is.</p>
<p class="indented">When we spent Easter with our friends Asun and Ambro in Burgos, Asun made a generous batch of these on Maundy Thursday, keeping them in the fridge to see us through to Easter, and I was surprised how delicious they were even when fried and eaten cold.</p>
<p class="indented">This is an amalgamation of Asun’s recipe and one from Nico, chef at our Tramontana restaurant. Use a stale loaf or brioche that will absorb the flavours in the milk without disintegrating.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">250ml milk</p>
<p class="ingredients">50ml double cream</p>
<p class="ingredients">80g sugar</p>
<p class="ingredients">the peel of ½ a lemon</p>
<p class="ingredients">the peel of ½ an orange</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 cinnamon stick</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 vanilla pod</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 slices of stale bread, from a tin loaf or brioche</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 eggs</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons olive oil, or 40g clarified butter</p>
<p class="ingredients">1½ tablespoons sugar, to finish</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, to finish (optional)</p>
<p class="method">Warm the milk and cream in a pan with the sugar, peel, cinnamon stick and vanilla pod (seeds scraped in). Heat gently and just before it comes to the boil, take off the heat and leave for 30 minutes to infuse.</p>
<p class="method">Arrange the slices of bread in a wide, shallow dish and pour the infused milk and cream over them. Leave for at least 10 minutes, to allow the bread to soak up the mixture.</p>
<p class="method">Break the eggs into another wide, shallow dish and beat them with a fork. Once the slices of bread are soft with milk, coat each slice on both sides in the beaten egg.</p>
<p class="method">Heat the oil or clarified butter in a large frying pan and fry the slices, no more than one or two at a time, on both sides for about 2 minutes, until they brown around the edges. Then serve, or keep in the fridge and eat when cold, sprinkled with sugar and, if you like, ground cinnamon.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec198"><a id="pg_481"/>Mousse de turrón</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead"><em>Turrón</em> mousse</p>
<p class="flush_left">Josep Carbonell created this dessert for our first tapas bar menu and it has been a signature pudding ever since. It looks good served in glass tumblers.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes 8</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g raisins</p>
<p class="ingredients">200ml good sherry, such as Pedro Ximénez</p>
<p class="ingredients">300g soft <strong><em>turrón</em></strong> (nougat), broken into pieces</p>
<p class="ingredients">300ml double cream</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 eggs, separated</p>
<p class="method">Put the raisins into a small pan with the sherry and bring to the boil, then take off the heat and leave to cool.</p>
<p class="method">Put the <em>turrón</em> into a food processor with the cream and egg yolks and mix for a minute until you have a smooth paste.</p>
<p class="method">In a bowl, whisk the egg whites until they are frothy, then gently fold into the <em>turrón</em> mixture.</p>
<p class="method">Put a heaped teaspoon of raisins along with a level teaspoon of the marinating sherry into the base of each of 8 glass tumblers – keeping back a few raisins to decorate – and fill with mousse.</p>
<p class="method">Put into the fridge for at least 2 hours to allow the mousse to set (although it will not become hard), and decorate with the reserved raisins just before serving.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec199">Horchata de piñones</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Pine nut <em>horchata</em></p>

<p class="flush_left">Our head chef, Leo, is a genius with sweet things and one summer’s day he put this simple dessert on the menu. It’s a recipe that dates back to his time working in a restaurant in Arenys de Mar on the Catalan coast, when he and his colleagues were looking for lighter ways to use local ingredients.</p>
<p class="indented">Like all <em>horchatas</em> (nut milks), it has a consistency that is slightly thicker than regular milk, but it is meant to be drunk, rather than spooned – though if you are using whole berries, or large slices of berry, these can be scooped out with a spoon.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 2</p>
<p class="ingredients">75g sugar</p>
<p class="ingredients">125g Spanish pine nuts</p>
<p class="ingredients">50g wild strawberries or small slices of cultivated strawberries, to decorate</p>
<p class="method">Put the sugar into a pan with 500ml of water and heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Just as the water starts to boil, remove from the heat and add 100g of the pine nuts.</p>
<p class="method">Leave to cool, and then blend with a hand blender. Put into the fridge to chill for 12 hours, or overnight.</p>
<p class="method">Strain the liquid (which will now be a milky colour) through a fine sieve or muslin.</p>
<p class="method">Toast the remaining 25g of pine nuts in a dry pan until golden.</p>
<p class="method">Pour into small glasses and decorate with the toasted pine nuts and strawberries.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_483"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg483.jpg"/></div>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec200"><a id="pg_482"/>Quesada la bauma con confitura de tomate</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Goat’s curd cheesecake with sweet tomato jam</p>
<p class="flush_left">On a visit to Toni Chueca, who supplies us with Garrotxa goat’s cheese from his La Bauma dairy in Berguedà, he gave me some goat’s curd to try, explaining that he sells it to Catalan chefs for sauces and puddings. It was so delicious – delicate and sweet, with almost no acidity – that I decided we must bring some to London, and Leo developed this recipe around it for Casa Brindisa. Our chefs, who have the benefit of large ovens, bake the cake in long-handled metal frying pans, but at home you can use a more conventional cake tin.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes a large cake, serving around 12</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g goat’s curd</p>
<p class="ingredients">8 eggs</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g caster sugar</p>
<p class="ingredients">750ml double cream</p>
<p class="ingredients">icing sugar and ground cinnamon, to decorate</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 tablespoons sweet tomato jam (see <a href="chapter_006.html#pg_533">here</a>), to serve</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 140°C/ gas 1.</p>
<p class="method">Slowly combine the goat’s curd, eggs, sugar and double cream in a bowl.</p>
<p class="method">Line a 22cm, 6cm high ceramic dish or cake tin with foil, making sure you leave no gaps in order to avoid any leakage, and spoon in the mixture.</p>
<p class="method">Place the dish or tin in a deep roasting pan. Pour in enough boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the pan and put into the preheated oven for 1¼ hours until, if you shake it gently, it has a more solid jelly-like texture. Switch the oven off and leave in the oven for another 45 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Remove and allow to cool fully for another 30 minutes before putting into the fridge to chill for around 12 hours (or overnight). To turn out, place a plate over the top of the tin and turn both over together so that the cheesecake is sitting on the plate.</p>
<p class="method">Dust the top with sugar and cinnamon and serve with the tomato jam.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec201"><a id="pg_484"/>Flaó d’Eivissa</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Ibizan cheesecake</p>
<p class="method">We opened our Tramontana restaurant with this Ibizan cheesecake on the menu. The addition of mint to cheesecakes and almond tarts is a refreshing touch typical of the Balearic Islands. This cake pairs really well with a sweet Moscatel wine or a Malvasia from Sitges.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes 1 x 30cm cheesecake</p>
<p class="ingredients">6 mint leaves</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 eggs</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g caster sugar</p>
<p class="ingredients">600g fresh goat’s curd or ricotta</p>
<p class="ingredients">icing sugar, to finish</p>
<p class="forhead">For the pastry</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g plain flour, plus a little extra for preparing the tart tin</p>
<p class="ingredients">a pinch of salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">¼ teaspoon baking powder</p>
<p class="ingredients">50g caster sugar</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon anise seeds</p>
<p class="ingredients">65g unsalted butter, softened, plus a little extra for preparing the tart tin</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 egg</p>
<p class="ingredients">zest of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="ingredients">25ml anise liqueur</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 170°C/gas 3.</p>
<p class="method">To make the pastry, combine the flour, salt, baking powder, sugar and anise seeds in a bowl. Add the softened butter, the egg, lemon zest and liqueur and mix until the dough comes together in a ball. Wrap in clingfilm and put into the fridge for 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Prepare a 30cm tart tin with a removable base by greasing with a little butter and then dusting with flour, turning the tin to make sure that it is fully coated, and tipping out any excess flour.</p>
<p class="method">Lightly flour a clean work surface and roll out the pastry into a circle around 5mm thick and large enough to line the tin. Roll the pastry around your rolling pin, then lift it up and unroll it into the prepared tart tin. Line with baking paper and baking beans and put into the oven for 5 minutes, so that it is only lightly coloured and not browned. Remove from the oven and trim any overlapping edges.</p>
<p class="method">For the filling, tear the mint into small pieces and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">In a bowl, beat the eggs and caster sugar briefly.</p>
<p class="method">In a separate bowl, mix the curd or ricotta with the mint (keep back a few pieces to decorate the top of the cheesecake), then fold into the eggs and sugar until you have a smooth mixture.</p>
<p class="method">Spoon into the pastry case and decorate with some extra mint leaves, if you like. Put into the oven for 35 minutes, making sure that the top of the cheesecake doesn’t brown.</p>
<p class="method">Turn off the oven and leave the tart in until it has cooled to room temperature. Remove and chill in the fridge before serving, dusted with icing sugar.</p>


<p class="recipe-head" id="rec202"><a id="pg_485"/>Brindisa arroz con leche</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Brindisa rice pudding</p>

<p class="flush_left">This is a big favourite in the Brindisa tapas bars and restaurants. We make it with medium-grain rice (we use a Balilla x Sollana cross, see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_341">here</a>) grown in Calasparra, and although the pudding is quite loose-textured, the grains of rice retain their feel and shape within it.</p>
<p class="indented">When the pudding is first taken off the heat it will be more liquid than you might expect, if you are used to more sturdy British rice puddings. It will look more like a <em>caldoso</em> – the soupy savoury rice dish (see <a href="chapter_004.html#rec137">here</a>), but as it cools down the rice will absorb more of the citrusy milk and become creamier, although it will never be as thick as the British version. You need the peel from one orange and one lemon – half of the peel from each fruit is cut into large strips to go into the pudding, and the rest is cut into thinner, more elegant strips for decorating the top.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 litre whole milk</p>
<p class="ingredients">the peel of ½ a lemon and ½ an orange, cut into large strips</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 cinnamon stick</p>
<p class="ingredients">125g medium-grain rice, such as that from Calasparra</p>
<p class="ingredients">50g caster sugar</p>
<p class="ingredients">ground cinnamon, to decorate (optional)</p>
<p class="forhead">For the citrus peel confit</p>
<p class="ingredients">the rind of ½ a lemon and ½ an orange, cut into long, thin strips</p>
<p class="ingredients">50g granulated sugar</p>
<p class="method">First make the confit to decorate the dish. Blanch the thin strips of peel in a small pan of boiling water for 1 minute, just to remove their bitterness, then drain and refresh under the cold water tap.</p>
<p class="method">Put the sugar into a heavy-bottomed pan with 200ml of water over a low heat until the sugar dissolves, then add the blanched peel and simmer for about 20 minutes, until the syrup reduces and thickens. Remove from the heat and leave to cool.</p>
<p class="method">Put the milk, the large strips of orange and lemon peel and the cinnamon stick into a separate pan and bring to the boil, then take off the heat, add the rice and sugar and stir well.</p>
<p class="method">Put back on the hob over a medium heat for 5 minutes, stirring and watching carefully to make sure that the milk doesn’t boil over or burn. After 5 minutes, turn down to low and cook for 20 minutes, stirring often, and constantly towards the end.</p>
<p class="method">The texture of the rice pudding will be quite liquid at this stage, but will thicken as it cools (see <a href="chapter_005.html#pg_485">here</a>). Spoon into a serving dish or individual dishes, cover with clingfilm to prevent a skin from forming, then put into the fridge for at least 3 hours, preferably 24 hours.</p>
<p class="method">Before serving, remove the peel and cinnamon stick, decorate the bowl or bowls with the confit citrus strips and sprinkle, if you like, with a little cinnamon.</p>

<p class="quote">‘an incredible concentration of aromatic, essential oils’</p>
<p class="flush_left">One of the most exciting additions to the fresh produce we bring in from Spain is the limited production of fabulous organic moon lemons sent to us by the writer Paul Richardson and his Spanish partner Nacho.</p>
<p class="indented">They gather them from small family farms and trees planted in the backyards and <em>huertas</em> (vegetable gardens) of the stone houses in the village of Hoyos in Sierra de Gata, Extremadura, where he and Nacho live and make their own olive oil, grow their own vegetables and keep pigs to make hams and sausages.</p>
<p class="indented">The lemons are an ancient, heritage variety whose name comes from the fact that they flower once a month instead of once or twice a year.</p>
<p class="indented">The trees are planted behind stone walls to protect them from frosts, since this area is only just below the northern limit for growing citrus fruit and the temperature changes dramatically between day and night. However, it is this special microclimate that helps to develop the intense flavour of the rough-skinned lemons and the incredible concentration of aromatic, essential oils in the zest.</p>
<p class="indented">When Paul first moved to the village 16 years ago, he was astounded at the way the villagers took the lemons for granted, often not even bothering to harvest them, so that the fruit was left to rot on the ground. He made it his mission to knock on the doors of neighbours and villagers asking to buy the lemons in order to bring over boxes of them to show off in London.</p>
<p class="indented">They are truly amazing in puddings such as <em>arroz con leche</em> (<a href="chapter_005.html#pg_485">here</a>), and in the restaurants we also grill them and serve them with fish; we use them in cocktails and gin and tonics, and they are excellent for the <em>limonada</em> and Easter lemons see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_159">here</a>.</p>

<p class="recipe-subhead">Ana’s slow-cooked sweet orange infused rice</p>
<p class="flush_left">This version of rice pudding given to me by Ana Barrera (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_442">here</a>) is made with pure Bomba rice (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_341">here</a>), and is exceptionally creamy, thanks to the absorption capacity of the rice and the long, slow cooking that reduces the milk to the consistency of double cream, fusing it with the rice grains to give a concentrated flavour and a texture similar to risotto. It is such a simple thing to make: all it needs is steady stirring, a watchful eye and patience.</p>
<p class="indented">Ana serves it at room temperature, not chilled, and, if you want to be really indulgent, she advises that it is very good paired with a dark chocolate pudding; however, we like it simply decorated with citrus confit (see <a href="chapter_005.html#pg_485">here</a>). As Ana uses only orange peel in the cooking of the rice, you can echo this by making the confit with just the peel of one orange, rather than that of half an orange and half a lemon, if you prefer.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">1.5 litres full-fat milk</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g Bomba rice</p>
<p class="ingredients">75g caster sugar, plus a little extra if necessary</p>
<p class="ingredients">rind of an orange (in one or more big pieces)</p>
<p class="ingredients">a small piece (about 1.5cm) of a vanilla pod</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 cinnamon stick</p>
<p class="ingredients">citrus peel confit (see <a href="chapter_005.html#pg_485">here</a>), to decorate</p>
<p class="ingredients">a little ground cinnamon, to decorate (optional)</p>
<p class="method">Put a litre of the milk into a pan and add the rice, sugar, orange rind, vanilla pod (and seeds) and cinnamon stick. Bring to just under a simmer, then keep at this very low heat for about 2 hours, adding the balance of the milk a little at a time, waiting until the rice absorbs each addition before adding more, and stirring regularly to make sure the mixture doesn’t stick. Taste and add more sugar if necessary, as the rice cooks.</p>
<p class="method">The pudding is ready when the milk has reduced right down and is thick and creamy, almost like double cream, and the rice is plump. Leave to cool down to room temperature, then remove the vanilla pod, orange rind and cinnamon stick.</p>
<p class="method">Serve, decorated with the citrus confit, and a little ground cinnamon, if you like.</p>

<p class="panel-title"><a id="pg_490"/>Almond Confections</p>
<p class="flush_left">I really don’t know where the Spanish would be without the almonds that the Moors first introduced in the eighth century. In the autumn on city streets, alongside the chestnut roasters, you will see vendors of <em>garrapiñadas</em>: beautiful warm, coppery-coloured, sugared almonds in white paper cones.</p>
<p class="indented">If I am lucky, in November a little blue box will arrive from our friend Pilar Sapena (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_190">here</a>) and underneath a delicate lace doily will be a collection of tiny, exquisite <em>panellets</em>, dusted with cinnamon and white icing sugar. These are the little sweetmeats typical of Catalunya and all of the Levante region, made in a similar way to marzipan, but with the addition of eggs. Pilar’s are dainty, half-moon-shaped parcels fondly known as <em>panellets de aire</em>, since their almond and sweet potato filling is so incredibly light. Traditionally, <em>panellets</em> were made to celebrate All Souls’ and All Saints’ Day on 1 and 2 November, but luckily for addicts like me, these days you can also buy them all year round. Most typically they are encrusted with pine nuts, but you can also find them flavoured with coffee, chocolate and other ingredients, which also lend their own colours – they are a lovely way to finish a meal.</p>
<p class="indented">Then, as the season edges towards Christmas, the shops will be filled with all kinds of almond confections, from whole roasted nuts set in bars with caramel or within large rice-paper discs, to soft, egg-rich bars of <em>mazapán</em> (marzipan), praline chocolate bars, large <em>pan de Cádiz</em> – almond loaves with confit orange rounds set in the centre – and dozens of different <em>turrones</em> (nougats). The most famous of these are the soft blocks of <em>turrón de Jijona,</em> which resemble the Middle Eastern <em>halva,</em> but are made with ground and nibbed almonds crushed together with honey.</p>
<p class="indented">In particular, almonds form the basis of so many sweet tarts which, as they often don’t have pastry bases, are more like cakes. The most famous is probably the <em>tarta de Santiago</em> from Galicia, which has its origins in medieval times when pilgrims first made the journey (which is still followed) to the cathedral at Santiago de Compostela, where the remains of St James are buried. It is made only with almonds, sugar and eggs, and traditionally a stencil of the cross of the order of the saint is laid on the top of the cooled tart before it is dusted heavily with icing sugar, so that when the stencil is lifted the shape of the cross stands out boldly.</p>
<p class="indented"><a id="pg_491"/>Personally, I have never been able to resist any kind of almond cake or pudding, and throughout the Levante and the islands of Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza and Formentera I have also enjoyed many local versions of the almond tart/cake, some of which do have pastry bases and some have the inspired addition of fruit as well as spice. Often in the islands the filling is aromatised with mint in a similar way to the cheesecake see <a href="chapter_005.html#pg_484">here</a>. So rather than include the usual <em>tarta de Santiago</em> in this chapter I have chosen a couple of favourite variations.</p>
<p class="indented">While the details of the recipes may differ, the key to success is always the quality of the almonds. We always use Marcona almonds (see <a href="chapter_003.html#p90a">here</a>), as although they are expensive, they are wonderfully creamy, with a high oil content.</p>
<p class="indented">Different cooks have their own preferences as to how to work with them, whether to choose blanched almonds or ones with the skins left on to add more colour, or whether to grind them rather than blitz them, to give the tart more texture. Ultimately, it is up to you to experiment and find the method you like best.</p>

<p class="recipe-subhead">Orange and almond cake</p>
<p class="flush_left">This recipe from Ana Barrera’s Madrid restaurant is in a class of its own: moist, flour-free and citrussy. Ana recommends serving the tart with vanilla ice cream and a glass of Moscatel wine or PX sherry.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 8–12</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 medium oranges</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons orange liqueur</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">300g caster sugar</p>
<p class="ingredients">300g almonds, preferably blanched Marcona</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 teaspoons baking powder</p>
<p class="ingredients">6 large eggs</p>
<p class="ingredients">300g butter, well softened, plus a little extra for greasing</p>
<p class="ingredients">icing sugar and/or slivers of toasted almonds</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas 4. Grease and line a 25cm round cake tin with a removable base.</p>
<p class="method">Grate the zest of 1 orange into a large mixing bowl. Peel the orange, cut into slices, discarding any pips, and add to the zest. Add the juice of the second orange to the bowl along with the orange liqueur, olive oil and 4 tablespoons of the sugar and leave to one side.</p>
<p class="method">In a food processor, grind the almonds with the remaining sugar and the baking powder until very fine in texture, almost like flour.</p>
<p class="method">In a separate bowl, beat the eggs until they are lighter in colour and very creamy.</p>
<p class="method">Transfer the orange mixture to a blender and blend until very smooth, then blend in the butter a piece at a time and return the mixture to the mixing bowl. Whisk in the beaten eggs until smooth, then gently but thoroughly stir in the ground almond mixture</p>
<p class="method">Spoon this batter into the prepared cake tin, then put into the preheated oven for about 1 hour, until the cake is set and the sides are pulling away from the tin. It should be a rich, deep golden colour.</p>
<p class="method">Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely in the tin before lifting out.</p>
<p class="method">Dust with icing sugar and/or slivers of toasted almonds.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec205"><a id="pg_494"/>Torta de almendra</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Airy almond cake</p>
<p class="flush_left">In the Casta Diva wine estate kitchen in Parxent, in northern Alicante (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_190">here</a>), Pilar Sapena makes this very light sponge cake with unpeeled raw almonds, which she puts through a manual grinder attached to her table. The nuts come through in short worm-like forms speckled with dots of brown almond skin. Pilar says that the grinds, being larger and more uniform than anything she can achieve with a blender, give the cake a more interesting texture. You could also pulse-chop the nuts or put them into a freezer bag and crush them with a rolling pin – though you will end up with quite a high proportion of finely ground almonds as well as rough-chopped. When I made the cake with my daughter, we pulse-chopped the nuts and then sieved off the finer grounds – a bit laborious but worth it. If you prefer less skin, you could substitute half the quantity of almonds with crushed, blanched Marconas.</p>
<p class="indented">Although I suggest using a cake tin, Pilar makes her cake in a mould with slanted edges, so that when it is turned out and sprinkled with icing sugar, the sides, rather charmingly, resemble gentle ski slopes.</p>
<p class="indented">I must admit I like a little addition of spice in an almond cake, especially as it gives an amazing aroma during baking – so as well as dusting the cake with cinnamon, you could also try the variation that our head chef, Leo, makes at the South Kensington restaurant, replacing the lemon zest with two teaspoons of ground cinnamon and two teaspoons of ground star anise, added with the flour.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 10–14</p>
<p class="ingredients">12 eggs, separated</p>
<p class="ingredients">480g caster sugar, plus ½ teaspoon</p>
<p class="ingredients">grated zest of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 level tablespoons strong white flour</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon baking powder</p>
<p class="ingredients">tiniest pinch of salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">500g ground almonds, skin on (preferably grind your own, see <a href="chapter_005.html#pg_494">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">icing sugar and ground cinnamon, for dusting</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas 4.</p>
<p class="method">Line the base and sides of a loose-bottomed or release-spring cake tin (30cm in diameter and 6cm deep) with baking paper.</p>
<p class="method">In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks with the caster sugar and lemon zest until they are quite light in colour.</p>
<p class="method">In a separate bowl, whip the egg whites until they form snowy peaks, then add the ½ teaspoon of sugar slowly, continuing to whip, until firm and glossy.</p>
<p class="method">Gently fold the egg whites into the egg yolk mixture. Sift in the flour, baking powder and salt, and fold in, together with the almonds.</p>
<p class="method">Spoon into the prepared cake tin and smooth the top. Bake for around 45 minutes, then turn up the heat to 200°C/gas 6 for a further 15 minutes, until golden and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean (the cake will probably colour quite early during baking, so be sure to use a skewer to check so that you know it is ready).</p>
<p class="method">Turn out and leave to cool on a rack, then dust with icing sugar and a little cinnamon.</p>

<p class="recipe-panel-sub">Ice creams</p>
<p class="flush_left">Spanish-inspired ice creams made with British milk and cream are heavenly, and ever since Rupert and I were given an ice-cream churner as a present, they have become a big feature of our summers at home.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec206">Helado de Manchego</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Manchego cheese ice cream</p>
<p class="flush_left">Esperanza Añonuevo Heys originally created this recipe for our London Bridge tapas bar and now we serve it at our Brindisa Food Rooms. Although Manchego cheese sounds an unlikely ingredient in ice cream, it works beautifully, especially if you choose a young, creamy-textured one.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes 800ml</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g semi-cured or young Manchego cheese, finely grated</p>
<p class="ingredients">300ml full-fat milk</p>
<p class="ingredients">5 egg yolks (from large eggs)</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g caster sugar</p>
<p class="ingredients">150ml single cream</p>
<p class="method">Put the grated cheese into a mixing bowl.</p>
<p class="method">Pour half the milk into a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Remove from the heat and stir into the cheese. Keep the saucepan to one side.</p>
<p class="method">In a second mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks with the sugar until thick and creamy. Whisk in the remaining milk and the single cream.</p>
<p class="method">Pour this mixture into the saucepan and heat gently, stirring all the time until you have a smooth custard.</p>
<p class="method">Take off the heat and stir into the cheese and milk mixture, combining well. Allow the mixture to cool, then cover with clingfilm and put into the fridge for 2 hours.</p>

Since I have always adored liquorice sweets I happily embraced this recipe. It is best to use a good-quality liquorice candy of the kind you would find at a health food shop or market stall (such as the Calabrian stall at Borough Market).</p>

<p class="flush_left">When our former Brindisa chef Esperanza worked in the London Bridge kitchen we had fun one day making saffron ice cream with both Iranian and La Mancha saffron and comparing the results. Both were excellent, but the La Mancha saffron had the edge, particularly in terms of the wonderful aroma it gave to the ice cream. So I would say La Mancha saffron is the ideal, but otherwise use whichever you happen to have; just make sure that the threads are not too old or they will have lost some of their power.</p>
