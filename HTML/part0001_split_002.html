			<p class="rec-intro">A classic recipe from the Alsace region of France, beer soup is also popular in Germany, Holland and Belgium. It is absolutely delicious I promise you, and even non-beer drinkers will be won over. Traditional lager works well, but you can use any beer you particularly enjoy, including fruit-based beers. The little brochettes are a perfect accompaniment to the soup or can be served as a snack or with a salad as a light lunch.</p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 4</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 tbsp unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 onion, peeled and chopped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">120g fresh white breadcrumbs</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">330ml good-quality lager</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">500ml chicken stock (see <a href="part0010_split_002.html#chicken-stock" class="calibre4">here</a>)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 tsp brown sugar</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 tbsp crème fraiche</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">freshly grated nutmeg</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">salt</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">black pepper</p>
			<p class="for-the">Petites brochettes à la Suissesse</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">8 slices of good-quality air-dried ham (not too thin)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">200g Gruyère cheese, sliced 1cm thick</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 tbsp plain flour</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 tbsp breadcrumbs </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 free-range egg</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">vegetable oil, for deep-frying</p>
		</div>
		<div class="basic-text-frame">
			<p class="body">Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the onion and cook until soft. When the onion is just starting to take on a little colour, add the breadcrumbs and the lager. Bring to the boil and cook for 3 minutes, then pour in the stock and continue to simmer for 20 minutes. Season with the sugar, salt and pepper.</p>
			<p class="body">Blend the soup in a food processor until smooth, then tip it back into the pan and whisk in the crème fraiche. Sprinkle with a little grated nutmeg before serving with the cheese and ham brochettes.</p>
			<p class="for-the">brochettes</p>
			<p class="body">Cut each slice of ham in half and cut the cheese into oblongs measuring about 4cm x 1cm. Wrap a piece of ham around each piece of cheese and thread them on to little bamboo skewers or decorative metal ones.</p>
			<p class="body">Spread the flour and breadcrumbs on separate plates and beat the egg in a bowl. Dust each brochette with flour, dip it into the egg and finally coat with breadcrumbs. Half fill a heavy saucepan or deep-fat fryer with oil and heat to 180°C, then cook the brochettes until they are golden and crispy. Drain them on kitchen paper before serving. Always take care when deep-frying food and never leave hot oil unattended. </p>
