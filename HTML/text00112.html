 CHEESE SCONES WITH CHIVE BUTTER</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_lavd" id="nad0000292">
<em>However you like to pronounce them, scones were one of the first things that I ever baked. I think they are still a staple in teaching kids how to bake, as my nephew came home with these beauties a few years ago when he started to cook at school. I have made so many variations on the classic and there is a good reason for that: they are simple, easy and so versatile. These cheese ones are perfect to start or end a meal with. See, I told you they were versatile. Now all I have to do is find a way of making them acceptable to keep in my gym bag.</em>

<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Preheat the oven to 220°C/200°C fan/gas 7. Line a baking tray with baking paper.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000306">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Put the flours, onion salt and butter into a large bowl. Rub the butter in with your fingertips until it has mixed in well and created a breadcrumb texture.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000307">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Add the cheese and mix through. Make a well in the centre and add the milk. Mix with a palette knife, then use your hands to bring the dough together. Be careful not to knead, or the dough will become tough.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000308">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Dust your worktop with flour and push the dough out to a thickness of about 2cm.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000309">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Using a 5cm cutter, using one downward motion, cut out the scones and lay them on the tray. Bring the offcuts together, being careful not to knead. Cut out as many circles as you can until you run out of dough.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000310">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Brush the tops with milk and bake for 12–15 minutes, until the scones are golden and well risen.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000311">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 To make the chive butter, mix the softened butter with the salt and chives. Lay out a piece of cling film and tip out the butter on to it. Tease the cling film so the butter makes a sausage shape. Wrap and twist the ends, then refrigerate and serve in slices with the scones.</p>
