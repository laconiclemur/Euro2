<h2 class="h2b">MOSAIQUE DE VOLAILLES</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Duck and Chicken Terrine</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>This recipe is based on a terrine that I learned while working with Raymond Blanc. Although minus the foie gras he so loves, and slightly less extravagant than his, it still makes for a very elegant dish. The terrine is also extremely practical as it really should be made a few days in advance and will keep well in the fridge for up to five days. Serve with something sharp such as a few pickled vegetables or a well-dressed salad and some grilled bread. You need a small terrine mould of about 15cm (6in)</em>.</p>
<div class="hang0">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 6–8</span><br/>
2 large chicken breasts (about 175g/6oz each)<br/>
1 large duck breast<br/>
100g (3½ oz) chicken livers, trimmed, well rinsed and dried<br/>
50ml (2fl oz) Cognac<br/>
1 large sprig fresh rosemary, leaves picked from the stalks, finely chopped<br/>
1 bay leaf<br/>
2 strips dried orange zest (<em><a href="chapter_006j.html#page173">see here</a></em>), ground<br/>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>
Vegetable oil for greasing<br/>
10–12 pork back fat rashers to line the dish</p>
</div>
<div class="hang00">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">MOUSSE</span><br/>
100ml (3½ fl oz) ruby port<br/>
50ml (2fl oz) Cognac<br/>
1 large shallot, peeled and finely chopped<br/>
2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped<br/>
100g (3½ oz) chicken livers, trimmed, well rinsed and dried<br/>
1 egg, beaten<br/>
60g (2¼ oz) unsalted butter, melted</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 150°C/300°F/Gas 2.</p>
<p class="normala">Remove all sinews from the chicken breasts and just the top layer of fat from the duck. Slice each chicken breast into two and the duck breast into four. Remove any traces of green from the chicken livers and mix everything together with the Cognac, rosemary, bay leaf, orange zest and 1 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Leave to marinate at room temperature while you prepare the rest.</p>
<p class="normala">Brush your terrine mould with a little oil and line first of all with a double layer of non PVC clingfilm, followed by the back fat, making sure that you leave enough of both overhanging to wrap the terrine afterwards. Set aside.</p>
<p class="normala">For the mousse, in a small saucepan, reduce the port and Cognac together with the chopped shallot and garlic until almost dry. Purée this, then add the chicken livers and process until the mixture is completely smooth. Add the egg and butter, purée for a few more minutes until smooth and light and then strain the mousse mixture through a sieve. Season well and keep at room temperature.</p>
<p class="normala">Pat the duck, chicken and livers dry with a little kitchen paper. Build the terrine by putting in first a ladleful of the mousse to cover the bottom of the dish. Then place on top one piece each of chicken and duck. Cover with another ladleful of mousse, then another piece each of chicken and duck. Cover with mousse again, then all the chicken livers. Layer up with the remaining chicken, duck and mousse, alternating the position of the dark and light meats each time to create a mosaic effect.</p>
<p class="normala">Finish with the last of the mousse then fold first the back fat then the clingfilm over the top. Cover with foil and cook and weight down exactly as for the <em>terrine de campagne</em> <a href="chapter_006n.html#page176">here</a>.</p>
