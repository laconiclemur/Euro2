<h1 class="chapter">swordfish alla livornese</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>Livorno is a port on the west coast of Tuscany. It might not be an obvious destination while holidaying in Tuscany but it has a fabulous, huge market not only for fish but everything else you could imagine. We love going there to sample and buy all sorts of ingredients to bring home. We often seem to be the only tourists and I love to watch all the locals buying their fresh seafood. Cooking fish <i>alla Livornese</i> means to fry the fish first, then serve it with a tomato and garlic sauce. The potatoes are optional but do help to fill up our hungry teenage boys.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 4 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>400 g (14 oz) potatoes, peeled and cut into approx. 2 cm (¾ in) dice (optional)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 garlic cloves, peeled</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>10 g (½ oz) parsley, hard stems removed, plus a little extra, roughly chopped, to serve</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>fresh red chilli, to taste, or ¼ teaspoon dried chilli flakes</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt, to taste</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>250 g (9 oz) <a href="9781784881757_Split22.html#page_40">Homemade Tomato Sauce</a> or <a href="9781784881757_Split23.html#page_41">Fresh Tomato Passata</a></b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>200 ml (7 fl oz/generous ¾ cup) warm water</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 tablespoon capers, rinsed</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>small handful of black olives (stones in)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>approx. 4 swordfish steaks around 2 cm (¾ in) thick (about 125 g/4 oz per steak)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>‘00’ or plain (all-purpose) flour, for dredging</b></p>
<p class="tx3">If you’re serving the fish with potatoes, put them in a pan of salted water, bring to the boil, and cook until just tender. Drain and set aside.</p>
<p class="tx">Make a <i>battuto</i> by finely chopping together one of the garlic cloves with the 10 g (½ oz) parsley, the chilli and a good pinch of salt (see <a href="9781784881757_Split13.html#page_29a">battuto</a>). Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat and add the <i>battuto</i>. Fry for 2–3 minutes. Add the tomato sauce or passata and water and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and cook for 10 minutes. Add the capers and the olives, heat through and taste for seasoning.</p>
<p class="tx">Meanwhile, season the fish steaks on both sides and dust them all over with flour. Heat the remaining oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat and sear the fish steaks for 2–3 minutes on each side. Using tongs, gently remove the swordfish from the pan and add it to the sauce. Cook for around 10 minutes. Take the fish out of the pan with tongs and set aside on a warm plate.</p>
<p class="tx">Add the potatoes to the pan, with a little more hot water if the sauce is very thick. Cook the potatoes for five minutes and then put the fish back into the pan. When the sauce is bubbling hot, serve straight away with the extra parsley on top.</p>
