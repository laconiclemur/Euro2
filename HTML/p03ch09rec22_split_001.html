<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">Mercedes Garcia, who lives in the Andalusian village of Frailes, gave me a rabbit trap made with wire, one that her father made for a living. Rabbit was a staple of the rural population in all of Spain. It was also used as currency to pay the doctor. In</span> Corpus de la Cuina Catalana <span class="italic">(see page 105), I found what seemed like a hundred Catalan ways of cooking it: grilled, roasted, and braised with onions, or tomatoes, or mushrooms, bell peppers, snails, prawns, whole heads of garlic, olives, prunes, pine nuts, and with vinegar and sugar, red wine, or white wine—and it goes on. Later I found this recipe written by hand in Spanish, and I cannot remember who it was from.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 rabbit (2¼ to 2½ pounds), cut into 6 pieces</p>
<p class="qun">5 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">1 large onion, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="qun">1 head of garlic, cloves separated and peeled</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">2 cups dry sherry or white wine</p>
<p class="qun">3 thyme or oregano sprigs</p>
<p class="qun">2 bay leaves</p>
<p class="qun">8 black peppercorns</p>
<p class="qun1">1 to 2 teaspoons sugar (to taste)</p>
<p class="recsum">Ask the butcher to cut the rabbit into 6 pieces. If you have to do that yourself, here is how: Trim and discard any flaps of skin and the tips of the forelegs. Using a heavy knife or cleaver, cut the rabbit crosswise into 3 parts—back legs, back and rib cage, and forelegs. Cut between the back legs to separate them. Cut the front part into 2 pieces to separate the forelegs. Cut the back crosswise in half, giving you a total of 6 pieces.</p>
<p class="summary">Heat the olive oil in a large casserole, add the onion and garlic, and sauté over low heat, stirring occasionally, until soft. Put in the rabbit pieces, season with salt, and cook, turning the rabbit occasionally, until the pieces are lightly browned and the onion begins to color.</p>
<p class="summary">Add the white wine or sherry, herb sprigs, bay leaves, peppercorns, and sugar and bring to a boil, then simmer, covered, for about 35 minutes, or until the rabbit feels tender when you cut into a thigh with a pointed knife; turn the rabbit pieces occasionally. Uncover the pot for the last 10 minutes. The sauce should be reduced and a little syrupy. Do not overcook, or the rabbit will be stringy.</p>
