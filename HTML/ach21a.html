<h3 class="h3b"><a id="page_40"/>mushroom and white asparagus salad</h3>
<p class="author1"><span class="txit">insalata di funghi e asparagi bianchi</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Gianni grew up near Bassano del Grappa, a town in northeastern Italy that is renowned for its white asparagus. “It’s the best in the world,” claims Gianni. “They are abundant from the end of April through the end of May. During that season every restaurant, trattoria, and osteria serves white asparagus.” As Gianni explains it, the procedure for eating this local dish is almost like a religious ceremony. “Each person is served a plate on which are placed several very soft, warm asparagus, hard-boiled eggs, and some good olive oil. The eggs are crushed with the back of a fork and mixed with the oil and some salt and pepper to make a dressing. The asparagus (which is always eaten by hand) is dipped into the egg dressing and then consumed in one long bite. If you have never eaten asparagus this way,” says Gianni “you must!”</p>
<p class="indentb">This version of the recipe includes mushrooms and a delicate salad. It may be prepared with white or green asparagus. Pencil-thin asparagus do not need to be peeled.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">16 white asparagus</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 medium-size cremini or porcini mushrooms</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">3</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> pound purslane, mâche, or a mixture of lettuce greens</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons hot water</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup coarsely chopped toasted hazelnuts (see note)</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Cut 1 inch of tough stalk off the bottom of each asparagus spear. Use a vegetable peeler to remove a thin layer of tough outer stalk from the lower third of the asparagus. Blanch the asparagus in the water until slightly tender, about 1 minute. Drain and run under very cold water to cool. Cut the asparagus on a sharp bias into 4-inch lengths and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_41"/><span class="red">3.</span> Remove and discard the mushroom stems. If the variety you are using has soft brown gills on the underside of the mushroom cap, trim them away and discard. Cut the mushroom caps into very thin slices. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Place the salad greens in a large bowl along with half the sliced mushrooms.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> In a bowl, whisk together the vinegar and salt and pepper to taste. Add the mustard and whisk until smooth. Whisk in the olive oil and the water, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating to produce a smooth, emulsified dressing.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">6.</span> Pour the dressing over the salad and toss to coat evenly. Distribute the salad among four serving plates. Arrange the remaining mushrooms on top of each portion. Top with the asparagus. Sprinkle with the hazelnuts and serve.</p>
<p class="serves"><span class="smallcaps">— SERVES 4 —</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">WINE PAIRING</span>:</span> Sparkling, light white, and light red</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATIONS</span>:</span> As an addition to the basic recipe, 1 large portobello mushroom, with the stem removed, may be very thinly sliced, dusted in flour, and fried in 2 cups of hot but not smoking peanut or canola oil. Drain on paper towels before serving as a garnish on top of the salad.</p>
<p class="noindenta">In place of the hazelnuts, long, thin slices of aged ricotta salata or aged goat cheese may be arranged on top of the salad. I recommend using a vegetable peeler to create these slices (or you can simply grate the cheese).</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">NOTE</span>:</span> To toast the hazelnuts, preheat the oven to 300° F. Spread the nuts evenly in a small baking sheet or cake pan. Toast in the oven, stirring once or twice, until the nuts turn light gold and release their aroma, about 5 minutes. Allow to cool before chopping and sprinkling on the salad.</p>
