  <p class="center-para"><a id="page_15" class="calibre1"></a>For me, soup is the ultimate comfort food. There is nothing so warming as returning home on cold winter evenings to a steaming bowl of homemade soup. Or at the weekend, after a walk in the woods, knowing you have a welcoming pot of soup waiting for you. You can make soup out of anything you like and it is an excellent way of using up leftovers. It can be made in advance and heated up when required, or made in large quantities and frozen in batches to be enjoyed when you have less time to cook. It is one of the simplest of foods, but always one of the most satisfying and pleasurable.</p>

  <p class="center-para">In Italy, soup – whether delicate or hearty – is popular and is sometimes served as a <em class="calibre4">primo</em> (first course) in place of pasta or risotto. Lunches in Italy are often substantial, so in the evening a lighter meal is preferred, and this is often just a broth made from homemade vegetable, chicken or beef stock with the addition of <em class="calibre4">pastina</em> (small pasta shapes).</p>

  <p class="center-para">I love making meat stock or broth: all the ingredients go into one large pot and cook slowly until the meat is tender; the resulting stock can be served as a soup or used as the basis for another soup or stew. The tender meat is ready to eat as a main course, or can be made into other dishes such as salads or meatballs. It’s a great way to make the most of economical cuts of meat.</p>

  <p class="center-para">My favourite soups have always been hearty and substantial; beans, pulses and thickly sliced vegetables left gently bubbling on the stove, served with a slice of toasted country bread, a drizzle of good extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkling of grated Parmesan – heaven on a plate!</p>
