<p class="summary"><span class="bi">A Castilian adage, “Vaca y carnero, olla de caballero”</span> (<span class="bi">“Cow and ram,</span> gentleman’s stew”), is a reminder that meat was for centuries the food of the nobility. There was a time when most of the population in Spain only ate fresh meat at festivals or at weddings and funerals, and the everyday meat usually consisted of tiny bits of home-cured ham or chorizo in their stews. But today Spain is a country of carnivores.</p>
<p class="summary"><span>Lamb is the most common meat. In the Middle Ages, it was the meat of the Muslims and Jews, who could not eat pork, and of the old Spanish nobility who raised sheep for their wool. Pork is ubiquitous in its cured form, but it is still rarely eaten fresh, except in the areas where pig rearing is an industry, such as in parts of Andalusia and Extremadura. Cattle were in the past bred for dairy. The males were slaughtered young to be eaten as veal or were castrated for work in the fields, while fighting bulls were bred for the bullring. But veal was only for feast days or for the rich. Spanish veal,</span> <span class="italic">ternera,</span> <span>is not the pale pink veal of milk-fed calves; it is the darker meat of animals that have been slaughtered when they are between nine and twelve months old. But generally Spaniards love their meats very young. The high points of Spanish gastronomy are roast suckling pig, baby lamb, and baby kid, traditionally cooked in a bread oven.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span>Beef was rarely eaten until a couple of decades ago. The change came about when agriculture was mechanized and the oxen, or</span> <span class="italic">buey,</span> <span>castrated males that pulled the plow (some as old as twenty), became redundant. Then it was discovered that when they were no longer working, their muscle turned to fat and their mature dark, intricately marbled meat, if well hung, had a magnificent rich taste and a silky tenderness. The first</span> <span class="italic">asador</span> <span>(roaster) to serve ox steaks cooked over coals was Julián Rivas in the Basque town of Tolosa in 1961. The fashion for grilled ox steak swept through the cider houses of the Basque Country and eventually through cattle-raising northern Spain and the entire country. Now that Spain has run out of the old plow oxen and finds it hard to sell its milk because the European Union has milk mountains, it has turned to rearing the indigenous cattle that were spurned in favor of better milk producers during Franco’s time. The meat from these mature cows, which are fattened for several months before slaughter, is of a very high quality.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span>In the past, offal—tripe, heads, brains, ears, tongues, feet, tails—was not appreciated by the social elites. They only ate it on days of abstinence, as it was not considered to be meat. Foreign visitors noted with surprise that despite Church rules of abstention for Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, Spaniards ate offal on these days. The working-class poor in the cities got it cheap from slaughterhouses and specialty butchers. Nowadays offal is available in every market, and offal dishes are much-loved regional specialties.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span>You will find other main dishes with meat in the chapters on rice and on substantial dishes.</span></p>
