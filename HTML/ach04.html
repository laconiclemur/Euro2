<p class="author1"><span class="txit">mozzarella in carrozza</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This recipe is Nonna Tucci’s variation on the classic Italian sandwich, which I remember my grandmother preparing for me with fresh mozzarella on slices of round or long Italian bread—if you can’t find Italian bread in your market, look for a loaf with a crisp crust and a soft, spongy inside perfect for sopping up olive oil or sauce. Following her example, my father now makes this simple but tasty sandwich for my children using the freshest handmade mozzarella that he buys at local cheese or gourmet stores. Serve it for lunch with a light salad, or cut into squares to serve with drinks before dinner. When properly cooked and bitten into, the mozzarella in this “Italian grilled cheese” will produce long strings (the kids love competing to see who can pull the longest strings). These sandwiches may be prepared one hour in advance. Before serving, reheat in an oven at 350° F.</p>

In a large sauté pan large enough to hold both sandwiches, warm the olive oil over medium-high heat. Dip the sandwiches in the egg mixture, and when the oil is hot but not smoking, add them to the pan. Cook until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. You may also brown the edges of the bread by using tongs to hold the sandwich upright in the pan.</p>
