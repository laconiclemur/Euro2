<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Like nearly all Spanish words that begin in <em>al</em>, the origin of <em>alcachofa</em> is Arabic, in this case from the Arabic <em>al-harsuf</em>. Artichokes were one of the key products introduced into Spain from North Africa during the Moorish rule of the country. Today, Spain is the world’s second largest producer of artichokes (after Italy), and these thistle-like plants are widely farmed in Alicante, Murcia, Granada, south of Barcelona, and Navarra. The <em>alcachofa blanca de Tudela</em>—literally “white artichoke from Tudela,” after a town in Navarra—is the one almost exclusively sold in local Spanish markets. (Other varieties are grown for export.) Medium-small, roundish, and compact, with green leaves, its season begins in October and winds down in spring, with the winter months marking its peak.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 LEMON</li>
<li>4 MEDIUM ARTICHOKES, ABOUT 2 POUNDS/910 G TOTAL</li>
<li>6 TABLESPOONS EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL</li>
<li>7 EGGS</li>
<li>SALT</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Fill a large bowl with cool water. Cut the lemon into wedges, squeeze them into the water, and then drop them into the bowl. Trim the artichokes following the directions on <a href="243-chapter179.html#page_339">page 339</a>, making sure the tough outer leaves have been stripped away. Cut the artichokes into eighths or even a bit smaller. Leave in the lemon water to keep from darkening until ready to cook.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a large skillet or sauté pan, heat 4 tablespoons of the olive oil over high heat and add the artichokes. Cover and cook, stirring frequently, until golden and tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes to soften a touch more. Lift out with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> In a large bowl, beat the eggs thoroughly with a hand whisk until frothy. Season with salt. Pour the artichokes into the egg. Gently push down to cover with egg. Let sit and absorb for 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> In an 8-inch/20-cm nonstick skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over high heat. Pour in the egg mixture. Immediately turn the heat to low and swirl the pan in a circular motion for a few seconds to keep the egg from sticking. Cook until the bottom is golden and the tortilla set, about 6 minutes.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Wearing an oven mitt, place a flat, tight-fitting plate over the tortilla. Firmly pressing the plate against the pan, carefully and quickly turn the tortilla over onto the plate, and then slide the tortilla off the plate and back into the pan. Swirl the pan in a circular motion to settle the tortilla and keep it from sticking. Tuck any edges down with a spatula. Cook for another 4 to 5 minutes, until firm but still moist in the center.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">6.</span> Flip the tortilla onto a clean plate. Dab off any excess oil with a paper towel. Let cool before slicing it into fat wedges to serve.</p>
