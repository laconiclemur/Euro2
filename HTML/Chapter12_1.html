<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">B</span><small>ECAUSE WE DIDN’T</small> have a lot of money growing up, my mom, sister, and I would make cookies for family members for the holidays. Although my sister didn’t like to cook, she loved to bake, so it was an activity we could all do together. We made a lot of different kinds of cookies and cakes, but the one I remember most was Rainbow Cookies—you know, the ones that look like the Italian flag: red, white, and green. We made them every Christmas Eve day. They were easy to make with almond paste, flour, butter, and food coloring, layered with jam, and topped with chocolate.</p>
<p class="indent">One Christmas Day when we were driving to my aunt’s house, my mom kept hearing the crinkle of plastic wrap in the backseat of the car and asked, “What’s going on back there?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Nothin’,” I’d reply, my mouth full of cookies. When we got to my aunt’s house and mom presented her with this beautiful tray of cookies as a gift, I’m sure she noticed the big spaces where all the rainbow cookies once were and the chocolate icing in the corners of my mouth. But no one said a word.</p>
<p class="indent">These days, I like desserts that play salt off sweet. I also like desserts with aromatics, like rosemary and juniper. In my kitchens, I encourage my chefs and cooks to come up with desserts that are inventive and creative, but that mean something. I want the last thing you eat before leaving my restaurant to be just as good and exciting as the first bite you took.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>My parents got divorced when I was three years old. When I was six or seven, I sometimes got to go into Manhattan with my dad. So, I’d get dressed up in my little dress pants and a tie and go into the city with him. We’d walk down the halls of his office together, and I felt like such a cool tough guy. He’d take me out to lunch, and afterward we’d go to this street cart where they made these little skinny waffle cones called pizzelles. The guy would press the batter on the thin waffle iron, then bend it around to make a fresh cone. You’d smell it a block away.</i></p>
<p class="indent"><i>While the cone was still warm, he put in this big scoop of pistachio gelato . . . and so the gelato started to melt, and it dripped all over my dress shirt and good pants, but it didn’t matter because it tasted so good and I was there with my dad. That memory has stuck with me for thirty years.</i></p>
<p class="indent"><i>When I think back on it, there were probably other gelato flavors I could’ve had—chocolate, vanilla, strawberry—but I chose pistachio because it was green and I thought that was cool. Eating that dessert—sticky, sweet, and so fragrant—is just something I’ll never forget.</i></p>

<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>3.</b></span> In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and baking soda. Slowly add the flour mixture to the mixer on the lowest speed setting. Mix all ingredients for 2 minutes, stopping halfway through to scrape down the inside of the mixing bowl to incorporate all the ingredients.

<p class="noindent"><i>Every summer, the carnival came to town. They set up the rides, games, and concessions on the baseball field across the street from my house in Little Ferry, New Jersey. You could smell them heating up the oil for the zeppole in the afternoon, and it was all I could think about. Sporting a mullet and my finest Mötley Crüe T-shirt, I’d head over to the carnival to meet my friends and start the night with a brown paper bag of zeppole tossed with powdered sugar. My friends and I would walk around and try to get girls to pay attention to us—oblivious to the powdered sugar all over our black T-shirts. At the end of the night, we’d each get another bag for the walk home.</i></p>
<p class="indent"><i>At the time, zeppole felt like a special treat: you only got to eat them one week out of the year. Now that I can make them whenever I want, I like to play around with different kinds of flavored sugar to toss them in. You can make them, too. And you don’t need to break out your Guns N’ Roses T-shirt to complete the experience.</i></p>
