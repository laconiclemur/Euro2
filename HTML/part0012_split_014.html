  <p class="chap-para">When I cook roasted meat or poultry, I like to make a tray of roasted vegetables as an accompaniment. I usually put in whatever vegetables are lying around, toss them with some extra virgin olive oil, seasoning and herbs and slow-roast them in the wood-fired oven. I tend not to peel vegetables like potatoes and carrots because a lot of essential nutrients are in the skin, but I leave it to you. You can use whatever root vegetables you like: if you don’t have celeriac, for example, use extra carrots or parsnips. In warmer months, I use vegetables such as peppers, courgettes (zucchini), aubergines (eggplants) and baby new potatoes.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 large potatoes, scrubbed and cut into quarters</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 large carrots, scrubbed and cut in half lengthways</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 parsnips, peeled and cut in half lengthways</p>

  <p class="ing1">300g/10½oz celeriac (celery root), peeled and cut into large chunks</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 fennel bulbs, halved or quartered depending on size</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 red onions, peeled, halved or quartered depending on size</p>

  <p class="ing1">8 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 sprigs of rosemary</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 sprigs of thyme</p>

  <p class="ing2">2 bay leaves</p>

  <p class="para">Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6.</p>

  <p class="para">Put all the vegetables in a large roasting tin, toss with extra virgin olive oil, salt, pepper and the herbs. Cover with foil and place in the hot oven for 1 hour. Remove the foil and put back in the oven for about 20 minutes, until all the vegetables are cooked through.</p>
