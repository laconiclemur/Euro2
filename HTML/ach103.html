<p class="author1"><span class="txit">risotto con gamberetti</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">My father’s family emigrated from Italy to Vermont, where they would gather wild mushrooms to use when preparing risotto. That recipe became a family staple that has now been passed down through three generations of Tuccis. My mother created this variation using delicate shrimp, which beautifully accent the pearly white Arborio rice.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 pound medium-size shrimp, peeled and deveined, shells reserved</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 medium-size onion, quartered</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 celery stalk, cut into thirds</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 carrot (optional), peeled and cut into thirds</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 sprigs fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">5 cups water</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 tablespoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 clove garlic, chopped</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons butter</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup chopped onions</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup Arborio rice</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup dry white wine</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 fresh or canned plum tomato, peeled, seeded, and diced</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup finely grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> In a large saucepan, combine the shrimp shells, quartered onion, celery, carrot, if using, parsley, salt to taste, and water. Bring to a boil, then simmer gently, with the lid slightly askew, for 15 to 20 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve. Discard the shells and vegetables. When you are ready to prepare the risotto, warm the broth to a gentle simmer.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Warm 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large high-sided sauté pan set over medium heat. Add the garlic and sauté lightly but do not brown, about 1 minute. Add the shrimp and cook until they turn light pink, about 4 minutes. Remove the shrimp from the pan to a plate and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_203"/><span class="red">3.</span> Add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 tablespoon of the butter, and the chopped onions to the sauté pan. Cook over medium-high heat until the onions have softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add the rice, stirring to coat it with the olive oil. Stir in 1 cup of the simmering broth. When the rice has absorbed the broth, add the wine and tomato and stir until the wine has been absorbed by the rice. Add the remaining broth, <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup at a time, stirring frequently and allowing the rice to absorb the liquid after each addition, until the rice is al dente, 15 to 20 minutes. Add the reserved shrimp along with the last ladleful of broth and any juices that may have accumulated on the plate.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> The rice should have a slight resistance to the bite. If it seems too hard, add a little more liquid and continue cooking for another minute or two. Remove the rice from the heat and briskly stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and the Parmesan, if using. Serve immediately.</p>
