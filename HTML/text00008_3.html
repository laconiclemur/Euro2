<p class="first_paragraph" id="nad0000339">I often wonder who first came up with certain words to label the eating path of a day, and why each name was invented. All I can say is, thank you! I’m grateful for the breaks in our day that are dictated by the time on the clock and the rumble of our bellies. Especially the first meal of the morning. As a child, I loved breakfast – for me, it was all about the latest cereal advert on the telly, followed by a continual badgering of my dad as we walked the supermarket aisles. Not much has changed, and no matter how much I try to resist, I can still be taken in by the gimmicks of an all-singing, all-dancing, cereal-eating tiger. But breakfasts themselves have changed. They have kind of merged into elevenses, stuck their toes into brunch, walked into lunch and taken a nosedive into dinner! Some days I don’t know where breakfast starts or where it ends; we can eat it pretty much all day without even realizing it. I like to think that’s why we give it so many names. This chapter is a collection of my earlier-in-the-day recipes that regularly satisfy the bellies of my brood and prepare them for the day ahead.</p>
