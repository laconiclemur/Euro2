  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">I</span> received this recipe from Olga Cavaleiro, owner of O Afonso, a small pastry shop in the tiny town of Tentúgal, in Beira Litoral, famous for its egg desserts. These loaves are dense, with a thick, crackly crust. Olga uses a mix of approximately half cornmeal and half wheat flour, but she says it’s possible to increase the proportion of cornmeal for a denser, more crumbly bread. Serve this with any of the heartier soups, poultry, or meat dishes in this book.</p>

  <ol class="arabic">
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Dissolve the yeast in the warm water in a small bowl and let stand until the liquid is foamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in 1½ cups of the bread flour, cover with plastic wrap, and place in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Dump the fine cornmeal and salt into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Pour in the boiling water and mix on medium speed until a firm dough clumps together, about 3 minutes. Let sit until the yeast mixture is ready.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Switch to the mixer’s dough hook, scoop in the remaining 2 cups of bread flour and the yeast mixture, and knead on low, adding more flour, a bit at a time if needed, until the mixture comes together into a firm, elastic dough that cleans the sides of the bowl, about 7 minutes.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Line a 13-by-18-inch rimmed baking sheet with parchment and sprinkle with coarse cornmeal; set aside. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead a few times. If the dough is sticking, sprinkle with a bit of flour. Cut it in half and shape each piece into a ball. Cup one ball in both hands and stretch the sides of the dough down and under, making an oval, then turn 90 degrees and repeat, creating a smooth round with a tight surface. Securely pinch the seams closed underneath and turn seam side down. Repeat with the second ball of dough. Dust the loaves heavily with bread flour. Transfer to the baking sheet, cover with a tea towel, and let rise in a warm, draft-free spot until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent"><a id="page189"></a>Position a rack in the middle of the oven. Place a heavy-bottomed skillet on the floor of the oven, and crank up the heat to 475°F.</p>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Uncover the loaves and slide the baking sheet into the oven, then lean back and pour 1½ cups of water into the skillet. Close the door quickly. (The steam will create a lovely crispy crust.) Wait for 5 minutes, and repeat. Bake until the loaves are golden brown and crackly—charred in spots isn’t a bad thing—and sound hollow when thwacked on the bottom, 35 to 45 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool until just warm. These are best devoured the same day.</p>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Prick the sweet potato all over with a fork, pop it into the microwave, and zap on high until softened, about 5 minutes. Alternatively, place the potato on a foil-lined baking sheet and roast in a 400°F oven until soft, about 40 minutes.

Slip one hand under the towel, turn a dough circle onto your other hand, and slide it onto the griddle. Cook, pressing down lightly with a spatula to create a golden-brown underside, about 4 minutes. Flip and brown the second side for 2 to 3 minutes. Slip the <em>bolo</em> onto a baking sheet and repeat with the remaining circles of dough.</p>

  <p class="center"><strong><span class="small">SERVES 6 TO 8</span></strong></p>

  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">I</span> grew up eating bowls of <em>recheio,</em> literally “stuffing.” My grandmother made it, and no one, but no one, could match her. It was a moist bread concoction studded with chouriço and bacon. While living in Portugal, I found that none of my friends had ever heard of <em>recheio.</em> And no wonder. The mainlanders have their own word for it: <em>migas.</em> In their honor, I’ve changed the name of this recipe.</p>

  <p class="indent">Serve this alongside beef, pork, roasted chicken, or Thanksgiving turkey.</p>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Heat a Dutch oven over medium-low heat. Add the bacon and cook, stirring often, until the fat has rendered and the meaty bits are crisp, 12 to 15 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels. Pour off all but a thin film of fat from the pot into a cup and reserve. Bump up the heat to medium-high, add the chouriço, and cook, stirring often, until lightly browned, about 7 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the sausage to a bowl. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of fat, adding it to the bacon fat. If the pan is dry, add 2 tablespoons of oil.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Lower the heat to medium, add the onions, and cook until soft, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and pepper flakes and cook for 1 minute more. Splash in the wine, add the red pepper paste and tomato paste, scrape up any stuck-on bits, then let burble for a few minutes to cook the mixture.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Turn the heat to low, add the bread and the reserved bacon and chouriço fats, and pour in just enough of the stock-water combination, beating well with a spoon, to make the mixture moist. If you use all the liquid and the pot is still dry, add water as necessary. Fold in the bacon and chouriço and continue beating to lighten the mixture. Take a taste and season with salt and pepper if needed. Scoop the dressing into a bowl and speckle with the parsley.</p>

  <p class="center"><span class="big"><em>massa sovada</em></span></p>

  <p class="center"><strong><span class="small">MAKES ONE 9-INCH ROUND LOAF</span></strong></p>

  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">M</span>y grandmother Leite and aunts Irena, Exaltina, and Lourdes would have marathon assembly-line baking sessions in which they’d make dozens of loaves of <em>massa sovada</em> for the family. These weren’t the mini loaves you see in Portuguese markets today—they were huge affairs, fifteen inches in diameter.</p>

  <p class="indent">This slightly sweet bread, with just a hint of cinnamon and lemon, is perfect breakfast and snack fare. I also like to let it stale a bit and make <em>fatias douradas,</em> similar to French toast (see the Variação).</p>

  <ol class="arabic">
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Heat the milk, butter, the ⅔ cup of sugar, and the salt in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, just until steam begins to curl up and bubbles form around the edges, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool to lukewarm.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Meanwhile, dissolve the yeast and the remaining 1 teaspoon of sugar in the warm water in a small bowl, and let sit until the liquid is foamy, about 10 minutes.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Plop 2 of the eggs and the yolk into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, and beat until frothy and light, about 1 minute. With the mixer on low, slowly pour in the milk-butter mixture. Switch to the dough hook, dump in the flour, cinnamon, and zest, and pour in the yeast mixture. Mix on medium-low until the dough is supple, 8 to 10 minutes, scraping down the hook and the bowl and adding more flour if needed.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and shape into a ball. Place it in a large lightly buttered bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm, draft-free spot until doubled in size, about 2 hours.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Generously butter a 1½-quart round baking dish (6¾ inches in diameter, 3 inches high). Set aside. Punch down the dough, knead several times, and form it into a ball. Cup the ball in both hands and stretch the sides of the <a id="page200"></a>dough down and under, making an oval, then turn 90 degrees and repeat, creating a smooth round with a tight surface. Securely pinch the seams closed underneath, and place seam side down in the baking dish. Let rise, covered with a tea towel, in a warm, draft-free spot until doubled in size and well domed, 2 to 3 hours.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Position a rack in the lower third of the oven (remove any racks above to give the bread head room) and crank up the heat to 350°F.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">With a very sharp knife, make a shallow slash across the top of the loaf. Beat the remaining egg and brush it generously over the top. Bake until the bread is a deep mahogany and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the middle registers 190°F, 40 to 50 minutes. Watch closely; overbaking will cause the loaf to be dry. For a shiny crust, brush on more of the beaten egg about 15 minutes before the bread is done. Transfer to a rack to cool for 20 minutes. Remove the bread from the dish, and let cool completely. The loaf will last for 2 or 3 days wrapped well in plastic.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Beat 5 large eggs, 1 cup whole milk, and a pinch of salt in a shallow baking dish. Heat 2 tablespoons corn oil or unsalted butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cut the day-old sweet bread into 1-inch-thick slices and soak them in the egg mixture, then fry until golden and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Sprinkle the slices with confectioners’ sugar or cinnamon, or drizzle with honey. Serve for breakfast or, as a nod to tradition, on Christmas Eve as dessert.<a id="page201"></a></p>
