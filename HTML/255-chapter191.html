<h3><a id="glolev20"/><span class="red">CUTTING A CHICKEN INTO 8 OR 10 PIECES</span></h3>
</div>
<p class="method_txt">Place the chicken breast-side up on a cutting board. Using poultry shears, cut the neck as close to the body as possible. Remove the wings. Cut away the legs by slicing through the skin, loosening, and then bending at the joint; cut through the joint at the ball and socket, and then cut away the leg, keeping the blade against the backbone. Separate the legs into drumsticks and thighs by cutting through the joint between them. Cut the ribs from the backbone. Separate the breastbone lengthwise into two parts. There should be eight serving pieces (plus the backbone). To get ten serving pieces, halve each of the breasts crosswise at an angle so that they are about even-sized pieces.</p>
