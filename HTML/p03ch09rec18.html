<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">Young domesticated pigeons, or squab, are an old delicacy of Castile. You see curious ancient clay and straw dovecotes (</span>palomares) <span class="italic">in wheat fields where the grain was once the ready feed for thousands of birds. At one time, pigeon rearing was a major agricultural activity, and the meat was often pickled or preserved in fat. Squab are birds killed when they are one month old, before they have learned to fly (until then they are fed by their parents). There is little meat on a squab, and most of it is on the breast; it is dark red and very tender and moist. The flavor is fine and delicate, quite different from the tough gamy flesh of wild wood pigeons (</span>palomas<span class="italic">). It is fashionable now to roast or grill farmed squab and to serve the meat medium-rare, but the traditional way of braising it in a red wine and brandy sauce also suits the delicate meat. Serve them with large slices of fried or toasted bread. Sautéed mushrooms make a good accompaniment.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4</span></p>
<p class="qun">4 garlic cloves</p>
<p class="qun">4 tablespoons (½ stick) butter</p>
<p class="qun">4 squab (about 12 ounces each)</p>
<p class="qun">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">1 medium onion, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">1 leek, trimmed, washed, and chopped</p>
<p class="qun">1 carrot, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">2¼ cups dry red wine</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup brandy</p>
<p class="qun">1 bay leaf</p>
<p class="qun">1 sprig of thyme</p>
<p class="qun1">1 cup chicken stock (or 1 cup water plus ½ bouillon cube)</p>
<p class="recsum">Put a garlic clove and a small piece of butter inside each squab. Heat the remaining butter with the oil in a wide casserole or skillet over medium heat. Brown the birds on all sides, sprinkling them with salt and pepper; then take them out.</p>
<p class="summary">Put the chopped onion, leek, and carrot in the casserole and sauté over low heat, stirring occasionally, until soft and beginning to brown. Add the wine, brandy, bay leaf, and thyme, and cook for 15 minutes. Add the stock (or water and bouillon cube), season with salt and pepper, and put in the birds. Cook, covered, turning the squab a few times, for 15 minutes, or until they are cooked. To test if they are done, pull one of the legs; it should move easily.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATIONS</span></p>
<p class="bl-first">• Sauté 1 Golden Delicious apple, peeled, cored, and chopped, with the vegetables.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• A Catalan version adds 1 tablespoon grated bittersweet chocolate to the sauce at the end.</p>
<p class="bl-last">• Sauté 4 ounces chopped <span class="italic">jamón serrano</span> or prosciutto with the vegetables.</p>
