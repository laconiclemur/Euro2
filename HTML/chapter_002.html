<p class="flush_left_large"><a id="pg_24"/>Among all the pleasures of eating in Spain, the many snacks of doughnuts, small cakes, pastries and biscuits that are popular in the morning (<em>desayuno</em>) or afternoon (<em>merienda</em>) are some of the greatest for me. I love them so much that I really have to hold back, otherwise I could happily munch my way through a mound of buns and pastries with a coffee or hot chocolate – possibly because although most of these snacks are sweet (though I have included some savoury recipes too), they tend not to be overly sugary, with their sweetness typically coming from the dough or sponge, rather than elaborate icing or pastry cream. Even so, mindful of the concern over eating too much sugar in the UK, I have often asked Spanish friends whether they would think of adapting a recipe to include less, but their answer is absolutely not, as a certain ratio of ingredients is needed to produce the right result. And since, in general, the Spanish still cook far more with fresh ingredients, rather than buying sugar-heavy processed food, a sweet mid-morning bun or pastry is considered much less of an issue.</p>
<p class="indented_large">Mallorcan <em>ensaimadas</em>, silky, soft coils of dough (see <a href="chapter_002.html#rec10">here</a>), are my absolute favourite treat, although <em>churros,</em> the long, ridged, deep-fried doughnuts that originated in Madrid, are probably the most famous (see <a href="chapter_002.html#rec2">here</a>) and other regions have their own versions, from the halo-shaped Manchegan <em>rosquillas</em> to the little round Catalan <em>buñuelos</em> (see <a href="chapter_002.html#rec1">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented_large">In Seville <em>desayuno</em> might be coffee accompanied by a <em>torta de aceite</em> – one of the famous thin round biscuits, made with extra virgin olive oil and a hint of anise, shaped by hand so each one is slightly different, and individually wrapped in waxy paper. And everyone I know who has moved to the UK from Cantabria, in the north of Spain, pines for the speciality sponge and cheese cakes of the region that are sold in every baker’s shop for <em>desayuno</em> or <em>merienda</em>. Cantabria really is the land of milk and butter, where herds of dairy cattle feed on the lush pastures, and the people all seem to have rosy cheeks, smiles and a contented, well-nourished look about them. Some of the <a id="pg_25"/>most appealing cakes are <em>sobaos</em>: charming, deep yellow, buttery sponge oblongs with toasted orange-coloured tops that sit glistening in their waxed white paper origami cases in the bakers’ shops.</p>
<p class="indented_large">In the Balearic Islands, in particular, many people celebrate afternoon teatime in a similar way to the British tradition, since the British occupied the islands in the eighteenth century. Whenever we visit our cheese suppliers and <em>afinadores</em> (maturers), Nicolás Cardona Enrich and Rosa Gornés Vinent, on a family holiday we are always treated to an indulgent late-afternoon array of goodies at La Palma, their country farmstead. Inevitably this will include flower-shaped <em>pastissets</em> (see <a href="chapter_002.html#rec5">here</a>) and star-shaped <em>flaons crespells</em>, mellow cheesy ‘buns’ that are a little reminiscent of cheese scones, but involve yeasty pastry pressed around balls of cheese mixed with egg and olive oil. Traditionally they were made for Christmas, Carnival, Easter and local festivals, but nowadays many bakeries offer them every day. Rosa and her mother make their own with young Mahón cheese in a quite elaborate process, which involves putting it through an old-fashioned nut grinder to grate it into loose ‘crumbs’ the night before baking so that it dries out a little. When the puffy golden- brown <em>flaons</em> emerge from the oven the cheesy filling has risen up through crosses in the pastry lids, giving a volcano effect, and they are delicious eaten warm, especially drizzled with a little honey.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec1"><a id="pg_27"/>Buñuelos de Viento</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Sugared brioche fritters</p>
<p class="flush_left">You will find variations of <em>buñuelos</em> all over Spain: doughnuts about the size of a new potato. In the Empordà area of Catalunya, they are typically rolled in sugar and anisette (anise liqueur) and are also known as Lenten doughnuts. Eggs were banned during Lent in the Middle Ages, but when they later became permitted, the doughnuts were traditionally made in the run-up to Easter. In Valencia similar <em>buñuelos</em> are made with pumpkin added to the dough.</p>
<p class="indented">These are the ones favoured by the family of our head chef at Brindisa, Leo Rivera, and I love them, as they are much lighter than most: beautiful airy little fritters, crispy on the outside and hollow inside; so light in fact that their name translates as ‘puffs of wind’. Leo rather sweetly calls them ‘intelligent’ because they flip themselves over in the hot oil as they fry so that they become golden brown all over.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes enough for a big plateful (around 30) of bite-sized puffs</p>
<p class="ingredients">250ml milk or water</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g butter</p>
<p class="ingredients">150g plain flour</p>
<p class="ingredients">approx 4 eggs</p>
<p class="ingredients">caster sugar, for coating</p>
<p class="ingredients">vegetable oil, for deep-frying</p>
<p class="method">Bring the milk (or water) and the butter to the boil, then take the pan off the heat, add all the flour at once and work into a soft dough with a spatula, until the mixture comes away from the sides of the pan. Put back on a low heat for about 2 minutes, stirring to keep the mixture moving around. Take off the heat, then add the eggs one at a time, working them in with a whisk. Don’t add the next egg until the previous one is completely absorbed into the dough. Four eggs is usually enough, but you may need 1 or 2 more to give you a loose mixture (similar to that of a sponge cake).</p>
<p class="method">Have ready plenty of caster sugar in a shallow bowl.</p>
<p class="method">Pour some vegetable oil into a deep pan – it should not come more than a third of the way up – then heat to 170ºC (or, if you don’t have a thermometer, test by dropping in a little of the mixture – it should sizzle). Taking 2 lightly oiled teaspoons, make ‘quenelles’ by scooping some of the mixture on to 1 spoon, then on to the other so that the mixture is smooth and egg-shaped, then use one of the spoons to ease the mixture from the other into the hot oil. Repeat, frying in batches, so that the mixture doesn’t lower the temperature of the oil.</p>
<p class="method">As the <em>buñuelos</em> fry, they puff up to double their size, and as if by magic they do a little somersault in the oil, thanks to the expansion of air inside. As soon as they are golden brown all over, lift them out carefully and dip them straight into the bowl of sugar, coating them well.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec2"><a id="pg_28"/>Churros</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Long fritters</p>
<p class="flush_left">One of my most memorable <em>churros</em> experiences was in the walled town of Benavente in Castilla y León, where Rupert and I were staying one New Year. It is an area that often gets neglected by visitors, as it is so isolated, with its quite stark, flat meadowland, dotted with round <em>palomares</em> (dovecotes): squat, circular houses, with red-tiled roofs and portholes around the top. When we woke up on New Year’s Day the temperature had dropped to sub-zero and the mist had come down so thickly we could only see a few metres ahead of us, but we headed for the only bar that was open. It was a perfect old-fashioned snug, lined with dark brown wood, a cross between an Irish bar and a Rennie Mackintosh café from the 1890s, where they were serving steaming hot chocolate that was thick and beautiful, perfect for dunking the sugary <em>churros</em>.</p>
<p class="indented">Originally these little ridged tubes of doughnut were a speciality of Madrid cafés and specialist <em>churro</em> bars. Here, big circles of batter are extruded into hot oil through a metal pipe, using a revolving handle, and deep-fried until crispy, then they are cut into lengths and sprinkled with sugar. They do a roaring trade in the early hours, satisfying the all-night clubbers’ need for a surge of sugar and oil on their way home, before gearing up for office workers, mothers and children buying their <em>churros</em> on the way to school, then the mid-morning wave of people coming in for a snack.</p>
<p class="indented">Though <em>churros</em> are an irresistible café and street snack, they are rarely made at home, since the batter is quite solid and hard to push out into tubes thick enough to sizzle for a while in the oil without burning. Some committed mothers do make their own, and this recipe is from the mum of our head chef Leo Rivera. He says that when he was growing up she would spoon the <em>churro</em> mixture into a funnel, holding her finger over the narrow opening and then releasing it when she wanted the mixture to flow into the hot oil – that is real dedication.</p>
<p class="indented"><a id="pg_30"/>At a push, you could use a piping bag with a wide, ridged nozzle (about the size of a £1 coin), but to be honest, it is very hard work, and you are better off buying a dedicated <em>churrera</em>. These are similar to the kind of pumps sometimes used for piping icing, and you can find them in some kitchen shops and online. If you prefer an easier, oil-free alternative, try the baked <em>melindros</em> (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_31">here</a>).</p>
<p class="makes">Makes about 6 coils</p>
<p class="ingredients">around 100g caster sugar for finishing, mixed with a little ground cinnamon (about a heaped teaspoon), if you like</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">a strip of lemon peel</p>
<p class="ingredients">about 2.5cm of a vanilla pod</p>
<p class="ingredients">25g butter</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g plain flour</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda</p>
<p class="ingredients">500ml sunflower oil, for deep-frying</p>
<p class="method">Have ready a big plate of caster sugar (and cinnamon, if using).</p>
<p class="method">Pour 500ml of water into a pan with the salt, lemon peel, vanilla pod and butter and heat until the water starts to break into a boil. Take out the lemon peel and the vanilla, take the pan off the heat, add the flour and bicarbonate of soda all in one go, and whisk it in as fast as you can until you have a smooth paste. The heat in the pan will cook the flour a little.</p>
<p class="method">Spoon the mixture into a <em>churrera</em> or piping bag.</p>
<p class="method">Pour the sunflower oil into a deep pan – it should not come more than a third of the way up – then heat to 180ºC (if you don’t have a thermometer, test by dropping in a little of the mixture – it should sizzle gently).</p>
<p class="method">Carefully pipe about a sixth of the <em>churro</em> mixture into the oil, forming it round and round in a big coil. Repeat this with the rest of the mixture. There should be enough for about 6 coils, and depending on the size of your pan, you will probably need to fry them in batches. Fry each coil for around 2–3 minutes, until rich golden brown.</p>
<p class="method">Lift out the <em>churro</em> coils, quickly cut them into lengths of about 10cm, then press each piece into the sugar so that it is well coated, turning it over to coat the other side. Serve with hot chocolate for dunking (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_32">here</a>).</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec3"><a id="pg_31"/>Melindros</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Catalan lady fingers</p>
<p class="flush_left">The first time I ate <em>melindros</em> was a great moment for me, as I had been looking for an alternative to <em>churros</em> that would be easier to make at home. And these are as simple as baking a tray of biscuits.</p>
<p class="indented">They are typical of Catalunya, where the pairing with hot chocolate is known as <em>melindros amb xocolata</em>. There is a café and chocolate shop in Barcelona called Cacao Sampaka, where they serve them in a very sweet way. They leave them attached to the strip of baking paper on which they were baked, which they roll up, so that when you unroll it you discover the <em>melindros</em> lined up like little soldiers inside.</p>
<p class="indented">This is another family recipe from Leo Rivera.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes 24–30</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 eggs, separated</p>
<p class="ingredients">125g caster sugar</p>
<p class="ingredients">125g plain flour</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon baking powder</p>
<p class="ingredients">caster sugar, for dusting</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 200°C/gas 6. Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper or use a silicone mat.</p>
<p class="method">Whisk the egg yolks, adding half the sugar a little at a time, until double in volume.</p>
<p class="method">In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until they form snowy peaks, then carefully fold in the rest of the sugar. Take half of this and mix into the yolk mixture. Combine the flour and baking powder and fold in, bit by bit, using a spatula.</p>
<p class="method">Finally, fold in the rest of the whisked egg white, taking care not to over-mix, as you want the mixture to be as light as possible.</p>
<p class="method">Spoon into a piping bag (we use a freezer bag with the corner cut off) with a nozzle about 1cm in diameter, and squeeze out lengths of the mixture (7–8cm long) on to the lined tray. Sprinkle well with caster sugar – you want this to form a crust – then put the tray into the preheated oven and bake for around 6–8 minutes, until light golden (the colour of a sponge finger). Don’t over-bake, as the <em>melindros</em> need to be a little tender inside, like a macaroon. Try to wait for them to cool a little before you eat them!</p>

<p class="square-subhead">‘an agent of sorcerers’</p>
<p class="flush_left">Thick, dark and substantial, like a liquid mousse, Spanish chocolate is a world away from the rather tame milky drink we are more used to in the UK. It was first brought to Spain from Mexico in 1528 by the conquistadors, led by Hernán Cortés, much earlier than it appeared in northern Europe. At that time chocolate was always made into a drink, and while the northern Europeans later started adding milk to it, there was no tradition of milk in Spain, so the Spanish made their hot chocolate thick and dark like the Aztecs, simply by roasting the beans, grinding them coarsely and adding cornmeal and hot water and sometimes spices such as cinnamon and chilli. At first it was such an expensive luxury that the drink was reserved for the Spanish court and the political figures of power and wealth who were concentrated in central Castilla and Extremadura (the seat of the <em>Reyes Católicos</em>, the Catholic Kings).</p>
<p class="indented">It was prepared to secret recipes by monks (who later sometimes added sugar), despite the fact that the church denounced chocolate as an agent of sorcerers – an association with wickedness that it has never entirely lost, and which only increased its allure. In 1580 the first factories for grinding cocoa were set up, and by the seventeenth century Spain was monopolising cocoa production in Venezuela, and the drink became more widely available, though the earliest commercial chocolate houses were naturally Castilian.</p>
<p class="indented">These days hot chocolate in Spanish cafés is more often made with milk, but it is headily rich and dark. There is a famous old bar in Barcelona, Granja M. Viader on Xuclà Street, one of the narrow little streets near the Boqueria market, where they have been serving hot chocolate in the same way for a century. <em>Granja</em> means dairy farm, and the café began as a milk shop back in 1870, with cows kept outside at the rear of the shop, which must have been quite a sight at a time when Barcelona was emerging as a busy new commercial and industrial city.</p>
<p class="indented">In the early twentieth century it was taken over by Marc Viader, the M. Viader in the ‘farm’s’ name. He had a big family, and he and his sons and daughters started exploring and developing <em>derivados de leche</em>, different ways to consume milk and cream. So they began offering <em>mató</em> (fresh cheese), which they still serve with honey and almonds, as well as yogurt and, perhaps most famously, hot chocolate drinks. In 1931 they developed the chocolate drink Cacaolat, which is popular all over Spain.</p>
<p class="indented">People would stop and have breakfast or snacks in the little bar – apparently the likes of Picasso would drop in for a <em>xicra</em> (the old Catalan name for the measure, or special cup, used for hot chocolate). The place still has the same <a id="pg_34"/>marble tables, old tiles and fixtures, and of course hot dark chocolate and <em>suizos</em> (chocolate with whipped cream on top).</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_33"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg033.jpg"/></div>
<p class="indented">Real, traditional Spanish drinking chocolate can be wonderful, when made by serious makers of solid chocolate. The two examples that we chose for Brindisa are vastly different in terms of their background and approach, but they share a total commitment to quality and individualism. At one end of the spectrum are the traditional makers, the Sánchez García family from Navatejares, a municipality close to El Barco de Ávila in Castilla y León; and at the other, the modern artist, our good friend Enric Rovira, the chocolate ‘sculptor’ from Castellbell i el Vilar in Catalunya.</p>
<p class="indented">El Barco is a town that was well known to me from the very early Brindisa years, as I first travelled there to meet Julián Sánchez García, our supplier of beans (see <a href="chapter_004.html#box12">here</a>) – and ended up discovering that his family have been making sweets and chocolate since the end of the nineteenth century. Their business, which was officially founded in 1905 by Julián’s great-grandfather, has evolved on the site of an old mill that was built at that time, with a wood-burning stove for roasting, and a series of wheels made with poles that were turned with leather belts and which powered the separator and grinders. Julián, who now runs the operation, selects and grinds all his own cocoa beans, and is hoping to renovate the old mill into a workshop that will pay tribute to the arrival of cocoa in Spain and his own family’s extensive history of working with it.</p>
<p class="indented">Enric Rovira’s philosophy couldn’t be more different. Along with the likes of Ferran Adrià, who used his chocolate at El Bulli, Enric is one of the <em>vanguardistas</em> of experimental Spanish food. When he shows our children around his <em>atelier</em> in Barcelona they are just mesmerised. He is a magic box of a person, intellectual and intense, buzzing with ideas. There is something quite extraordinary about the way he can sculpt and flavour chocolate that seems to owe something to <em>el duende</em>, a Spanish expression that is hard to translate, but that flamenco dancers often talk about, as the spiritual invocation they need in order to perform the ultimate dance.</p>
<p class="indented">Enric’s beautiful carved Easter eggs have been much copied – and many of his innovative flavour combinations have now become accepted in the wider chocolate world. He was the first to put the special Cabernet Sauvignon and balsamic vinegars produced by Forum in Tarragona in Catalunya into chocolates, in the way of traditional liqueurs. He has made chocolates inspired by Gaudí and encapsulated aromas inside chocolates that look like lipsticks.</p>
<p class="indented">Enric’s commitment to the finest chocolate is total, and he has been working with a small cocoa producer, Claudio Corallo, on the island of Príncipe, off the west coast of Africa. Corallo has been restoring and cultivating derelict plantations of the first variety of cocoa that was introduced from Brazil by Portuguese sailors around 1822, so the trees have never been hybridised and the beans have the pure flavours of the original fruit.</p>
<h4 class="c_head" id="p34a">How to choose and use drinking chocolate</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Drinking chocolate can vary as much as solid chocolate. In Spain it is so popular that in supermarkets you can buy it in every shape or form, from chunky blocks to be melted in hot water or milk, to flakes and powders. In most Spanish cafés and households children will have chocolate drinks at breakfast time, particularly in winter.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">Some of the best drinking chocolate is made with chocolate flakes or ‘vermicelli’ rather than powder, to give a rich, creamier taste.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">The main thing to decide, when you buy, is how you want to drink it: straight, as a milky drink, or thicker, for dipping <em>churros</em> or <em>melindros</em> into (see <a href="chapter_002.html#rec2">here</a> and <a href="chapter_002.html#rec3">here</a>). Also remember that when cocoa is the first ingredient listed on the label, as opposed to sugar, the chocolate will have a deeper, possibly more bitter flavour.</p>
<h4 class="c_head"><a id="pg_35"/>A la taza</h4>
<p class="flush_left">This essentially means ‘in a cup’, but this is dunking chocolate, thickened with cornflour and designed to be mixed with milk, so that it is almost sauce-like: perfect with <em>churros</em> – or my favourite <em>melindros</em> (see <a href="chapter_002.html#rec3">here</a>) – to dip into it. Sometimes it is sold as ‘vermicelli’ (flakes), sometimes powder. It can be <em>amargo</em>, which means bitter, and contains 66 per cent cocoa solids; or <em>tradicional</em>, which is less strong, containing 42 per cent cocoa solids.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">A la piedra</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Chocolate as the ancient Mexicans would have recognised it: a dark, solid block with a high cocoa content and unrefined sugar glistening through it. It may also have chilli added. You grate it, and then add milk and water according to taste – for the real authentic Aztec experience water is best, in which case it makes a dark, dark brown drink. It is quite bitter, so it is an acquired taste, but it has a dedicated following because it is considered to be pure and healthy. Dark chocolate contains a good level of iron, in particular, which the addition of milk counteracts.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Cacao desayuno</h4>
<p class="flush_left">This tends to be sweeter, with a higher ratio of sugar to chocolate, and is aimed at a younger audience, typically for breakfast.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_36"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg036.jpg"/></div>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec4"><a id="pg_37"/>Carquinyols</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Hard-baked almond biscuits</p>
<p class="flush_left">These twice-baked biscuits, similar to the Italian <em>cantuccini</em>, are famous in Catalunya, especially in the mountain village of Rupit, about half an hour’s drive from Vic, in the region of Ausona. When I lived in Catalunya I often used to visit Rupit, with its feisty river running through it and its stone streets, where the shops do a roaring trade in freshly baked <em>carquinyols</em>. Athough mostly people buy, rather than make, the biscuits, my friend Núria Montiel bakes her own, and this is her recipe. She uses whole almonds with the skin still on, so that when she adds the nuts to the dough before baking, it sticks to them. Mellow rather than sweet, and very crunchy, the biscuits are excellent with a mid-morning coffee, or a sweet aged sherry or Moscatel wine after dinner.</p>
<p class="indented">The trick is to get the timing right so that the dough, when baked the first time round, is not so hard that you can’t slice it into rounds for the second baking.</p>
<p class="indented">They keep well, up to 4 weeks in an airtight container, so Núria makes them in big batches.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes around 60</p>
<p class="ingredients">400g plain flour</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon baking powder</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 eggs</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g caster sugar</p>
<p class="ingredients">grated zest of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 teaspoons Grand Marnier, Cointreau or Triple Sec</p>
<p class="ingredients">175g whole almonds, skin-on, preferably Marcona</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas 4. Line a baking tray with baking paper.</p>
<p class="method">Place all the ingredients, except the almonds, in a bowl and mix to a dough, then add the almonds.</p>
<p class="method">Moisten your hands and divide the dough into three. Shape each piece into a <em>ciabatta</em> shape about 3cm wide and with a curved top, and lay on the lined baking tray.</p>
<p class="method">Bake in the middle of the preheated oven for 20–25 minutes, until the tops are golden.</p>
<p class="method">Take the tray out and turn the oven off. Leave to cool for about 12 minutes, then cut each piece horizontally into slices about 1cm wide. Put these back on to the lined baking tray – laying them flat – and return it to the cooling oven for around 12 minutes, turning once halfway through, until the biscuits have dried out and are crunchy.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec5"><a id="pg_38"/>Pastissets</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Menorcan flower biscuits</p>
<p class="flush_left">These pretty flower-shaped biscuits are one of the highlights we have enjoyed with our friends Rosa and Nicolás in Menorca (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_25">here</a>). I haven’t seen <em>pastissets</em> anywhere else in Spain, and their similarity to shortbread may be a hangover from the two British occupations of the islands in the eighteenth century. Our daughter Daniela loves to tuck into these, as they aren’t overly sweet, but mildly spiced, quite rich and crumbly. The traditional recipe uses lard, which in Spain is far superior to the British equivalent (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_40">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">In Menorca you can buy special <em>pastisset</em> cutters which come in different sizes, but you could use any flower-shaped cutter. I use some that are around 4.5cm in diameter. However, if you don’t have any you can just make round biscuits, or any shape you like. Daniela likes to shape them like little people.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes around 30</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 egg yolks</p>
<p class="ingredients">125g caster sugar</p>
<p class="ingredients">125g Spanish pork lard (ideally Ibérico, see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_40">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">¼ teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
<p class="ingredients">¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g plain flour, plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="ingredients">icing sugar, for dusting</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 165°C/gas 3.</p>
<p class="method">Put all the ingredients, except the flour and icing sugar, into a bowl and mix into a paste with your hands. Add the flour and work in until you have a supple dough – like a shortbread dough.</p>
<p class="method">Lightly flour your work surface and roll out the dough to about 7mm.</p>
<p class="method">Lay the dough on a sheet of greaseproof paper, then cut out using a flower-shaped or round cutter (about 4.5cm diameter) and put on to a baking tray.</p>
<p class="method">Bake in the preheated oven for about 20 minutes, keeping an eye on the biscuits to make sure they don’t burn. They should still be pale, like shortbread.</p>
<p class="method">Remove from the oven, cool, then dust the biscuits well with icing sugar – as if they have been in a light snowfall.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec6"><a id="pg_39"/>Galletas de almendra</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Almond puffs</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is a recipe devised by Scott Boden, who was my co-director during the nineties at Brindisa along with my brother, Mark. Scott is a dedicated gourmet who loves to cook and is always tinkering away intelligently in the kitchen, refining his ideas relentlessly with great attention to detail until he has a recipe just as he wants it. He was constantly looking for ways in which to use favourite ingredients such as Ibérico pork lard and Marcona almonds, both of which come together in this recipe. The puffs store very well in an airtight tin.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes 48</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g salted almonds, preferably Marcona</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g plain flour</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</p>
<p class="ingredients">150g Spanish pork lard (ideally Ibérico, see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_40">here</a>), at room temperature</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g icing sugar</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 175°C/gas 4.</p>
<p class="method">Line 2 baking sheets with baking paper.</p>
<p class="method">Put the almonds, flour and cinnamon into the bowl of a food processor and process until the nuts are very finely chopped.</p>
<p class="method">Put the pork lard and half the icing sugar into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle beater and mix on medium speed until fluffy (about 3 minutes), then mix in the vanilla extract.</p>
<p class="method">Scrape down any mixture from the side of the bowl, add the chopped almond mixture and mix on low speed until just combined into a dough.</p>
<p class="method">Form the dough into 48 balls about 2.5cm in diameter and arrange them on the baking sheets 3cm apart.</p>
<p class="method">Bake in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes, swapping the baking sheets over and turning them around halfway through, until the biscuits are very lightly browned around the edges.</p>
<p class="method">Remove from the oven and place the baking sheets on cooling racks until the biscuits are cool enough to handle.</p>
<p class="method">Put the remaining icing sugar in a bowl and gently roll the warm biscuits in it, then place them on the cooling rack for about 15 minutes, roll them in icing sugar a second time and return them to the rack to cool fully.</p>
<p class="method">Store in an airtight container. Note: the biscuits improve for a day or two after baking.</p>

<p class="square-subhead">‘a pronounced taste’</p>
<p class="flush_left">At one time most home baking in Spain was done with pork lard (<em>manteca</em>) rather than butter (<em>mantequilla</em>). This was partly because there was no proliferation of cows, as in the UK or France, and in the countryside most people would have kept a pig instead; and partly because, before refrigeration, butter would go off too quickly. As a result, recipes such as <em>ensaimada</em> (see <a href="chapter_002.html#rec10">here</a>) and many <em>coques</em> (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_70">here</a>) and biscuits rely on lard for texture and flavour. It is produced from all breeds of pigs but, if you can find it, it is worth choosing the more expensive Ibérico lard as it can be sweeter, and has a wonderful distinctive flavour and aroma – that said, I am aware that in the UK, where our own lard is completely different and relatively tasteless, its pronounced taste is not everyone’s cup of tea.</p>
<p class="indented">In the old pre-fridge days lard had an additional use: cured meats would be put inside earthenware pots and covered in the lard, which would keep the meat in good condition. Many of the old jars that we have collected on our travels were used in this way: one in particular still has a slight tackiness where the lard has penetrated the terracotta.</p>
<p class="indented">Some cheese-makers smear the rinds of their cheeses with <em>manteca</em>, either to help any further coatings such as spices or cereals to stick, or as a way of protecting them, allowing them to be cured for longer. Hams can also be coated with it as they cure, in order to seal any cracks in the leg, and all hams are lard-coated as they leave their curing chambers to be sold.</p>
<p class="indented"><em>Manteca</em> is made by rendering down cuts of bacon or <em>panceta</em> until you have a liquid, which then solidifies as lard. It is naturally white in colour; however, there is also a particularly fine Andalusian <em>manteca colorá</em> or <em>colorada</em>, which is seasoned, coloured bright red-orange with <em>pimentón</em> (paprika), and sometimes has pieces of meat or offal added to it. It might also be flavoured with oregano, bay and orange peel. Served on bread or toast, it is a popular tapa in the mountain villages of the south.</p>
<p class="indented">The residual hard pieces of rind that don’t liquefy are known as <em>chicharrones</em>, which are an equally vital ingredient in the traditional Spanish kitchen. Unlikely as it might seem, they are widely combined with sweet ingredients. In Catalunya they go into the square-shaped <em>coca de llardons,</em> a popular breakfast or teatime snack that is also traditional for Mardi Gras. Two sheets of puff pastry are studded with <em>chicharrones</em> that have been smashed into small pieces with a rolling pin, then baked, sprinkled with sugar and pine nuts, cut into pieces and eaten with goat’s cheese and fig jam.</p>
<p class="indented"><em>Chicharrones</em> can also be ground into a powder that can vary in colour between a mottled golden yellow and a chestnut brown, <a id="pg_42"/>and is used in traditional crumbly ‘sand’ cakes, known as <em>mantecados</em> and <em>polvorones.</em></p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_41"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg041.jpg"/></div>
<p class="indented">When I ate at El Bulli, one of chef Ferran Adrià’s famous dishes (a version of which has since been repeated at his brother Albert’s ‘tapas’ bar, Tickets, in Barcelona) consisted of wafer-thin <em>tacos</em> (slices) of raw tuna belly, which he had painted with Ibérico lard. Of course, the deep red tuna belly streaked with fat and laid out on waxed paper looked just like Ibérico ham, and the <em>manteca</em> disguised the aroma of the fish and replaced it with the sweet, complex, meaty aroma that is characteristic of the best acorn-fed Ibérico ham. So you were fooled into thinking it was meat. Then you tasted it, and there was a burst of tuna flavour. I can just imagine the fun they must have had in the El Bulli development sessions, deciding how to delude and delight the diner by fusing and confusing these two favourite Spanish ingredients.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec7"><a id="pg_43"/>Bollo de limón y nueces</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Light lemon and walnut muffins</p>
<p class="flush_left">This recipe comes from our friends Mercedes and Pepe (see <a href="chapter_002.html#box3">here</a>). As the muffins are not too rich or sweet, they are a mainstay of their children’s lunchboxes and light snacking at their house. Many of the recipes I have collected from friends in Spain use coffee cups or glasses as convenient measures in the way that was typical of Spanish households before everyone had kitchen scales, and Mercedes told me that at one time when she was making cakes, after she had broken the first egg, she would use half an egg shell (<em>cascarón</em>) to measure out the rest of the ingredients.</p>
<p class="indented">This recipe uses yogurt pots in a similar way. I think it is a great idea, but I have given the quantities in more conventional weights and measures too.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes 12</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 lemon yogurt (125g)</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 eggs</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 yogurt pot measures of caster sugar (285g)</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 yogurt pot measures of plain flour (255g)</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon baking powder</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a yogurt pot measure of vegetable oil (75ml)</p>
<p class="ingredients">50g chopped walnuts</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas 4.</p>
<p class="method">Line two 6-hole muffin trays with paper cases.</p>
<p class="method">Pour the yogurt into a bowl, then wash out the pot and dry it. Break the eggs into a separate bowl, then use the yogurt pot to measure out the sugar, add it to the eggs and beat together. Stir this mixture into the yogurt.</p>
<p class="method">Fill the yogurt pot with flour. Add this to the yogurt mixture and continue to beat.</p>
<p class="method">Add a second yogurt potful of flour together with the baking powder and stir in with a wooden spoon. Add the last yogurt potful of flour, then half-fill the pot with oil and mix in until smooth. Lastly, add the walnuts.</p>
<p class="method">Pour the mixture into the paper cases and bake in the preheated oven for around 25 minutes, until risen and golden.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec8"><a id="pg_44"/>Horchata de chufa</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Tiger nut milk</p>
<p class="flush_left"><em>Horchatas</em> are nut milks, and this refreshing, sustaining and healthy one made with <em>chufas</em> (tiger nuts) is one of my husband Rupert’s favourite drinks. So much so that he has a dream of setting up a machine to make <em>horchata de chufa</em> in our shop at Borough Market.</p>
<p class="indented"><em>Chufas</em> resemble wrinkled brown chickpeas and are the tubers of a species of sedge that above ground looks like a grass with long, flat, quite fibrous leaves. They are an ancient food that was first introduced by the Arabs to the area of Alboraia, just north of Valencia. Sorting the harvested, mud-covered nuts from the pebbles in the fields of Valencia was one of the unusual agricultural holiday jobs that Rupert took up when he was a teenager in Madrid (where his family lived at the time) to escape the boredom of the city and connect with the land.</p>
<p class="indented">The <em>chufas</em> have a tough, woody texture and milky, earthy flavours, and though you see them prepared as a snack at fairs, they are mainly pressed for their almond-like milk, which is a favourite served chilled during the hot summers in Valencia in particular, where the drink is known by its local name, <em>orxata de xufa</em>. The tradition there is to serve it with <em>fartons</em>, sponge fingers dusted in sugar, for dunking into it – something I find quite odd, as it is such a lovely, thirst-quenching drink, why pair it with something so dry and sugary? We like it just on its own, and whenever we are in Spain and find a bar selling it we always taste and compare, since the quality and especially the sweetness can vary enormously. Most often you find that it is not actually made from scratch on the premises, but from pre-prepared concentrate. The best we have found so far was actually not in Valencia, but in Mahón in Menorca, where in the heat of the summer we would knock back huge glasses of the homemade drink in a little café-bar that specialised in <em>horchata</em> and ice cream.</p>
<p class="indented">Because they are so small, the <em>chufas</em> consist mainly of skin, but what flesh there is, is bullet hard, white and as fibrous as a coconut, so you need to soak them for about 12 hours or overnight before using them.</p>
<p class="indented">How much sugar, if any, you add to the drink is really an individual thing. We often make batches to which we don’t add sugar at all.</p>
<p class="indented">Once you have experimented, you might find you prefer a stronger flavour. In which case reduce the water added to the chopped nuts to 600ml and you will end up with around 400ml of a more concentrated drink.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes about 800ml</p>
<p class="ingredients">500g <strong><em>chufas</em></strong> (tiger nuts)</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g caster sugar, or more to taste</p>
<p class="method">Wash the <em>chufas</em> well, a number of times, and put them to soak in 1 litre of water for 12 hours. Wash them again and drain well. They will increase a little in weight after soaking.</p>
<p class="method">Pulse-chop in a blender, until the nuts are the texture of desiccated coconut – it will take about 5 minutes, but it really is best to pulse-chop, as even when the nuts are soaked they are very hard, and could easily burn out your blender if you left the motor running.</p>
<p class="method">Add another litre of water and leave for 3 hours to rest, but no more or the nuts will ferment (I once left them overnight, and in the morning it was as if there was a beer monster in the kitchen!).</p>
<p class="method">Using muslin or a clean tea towel, strain well into a bowl or wide-mouthed jug, twisting the muslin or tea towel around the <em>chufa</em> mulch so that you push as much liquid out of the <em>chufas</em> as you can manage.</p>
<p class="method">Add the sugar to taste, and put into the fridge to chill before drinking.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec9"><a id="pg_46"/>Coca bamba de Menorca</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Raised dough spiral</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is related to the <em>ensaimada</em> that follows, in that it is a similar coiled shape, but it rises in a different way and is more cake-like, similar to an Italian <em>panettone</em>.</p>
<p class="indented">For the islanders a <em>coca bamba</em> any time is special, but it is also the typical treat during the summer horse festival when crowds fill the streets to see the horse-races, jousting, and the spectacular <em>jaleo</em>, in which the majestic, pure black Menorcan horses, guided by skilled riders in black tailcoats, jump and dance on their hind legs to music.</p>
<p class="indented">The recipe was given to me by Rosa Gornés Vinent, wife of our cheese supplier on Menorca, Nicolás Cardona Enrich. She is a wonderful, generous, cheery and affectionate woman, and as soon as I asked her for some recipes she told me she was racing home to go through a bunch of them with her mother, who cooks lunch for the family during the week and often gets up at dawn to bake. Then, at weekends, they cook together. Her mother is an authority on traditional recipes and handed-down wisdom in the kitchen and knows all about the best ingredients and where to seek them out.</p>
<p class="indented">A little like the <em>coca tovada</em> on <a href="chapter_002.html#rec17">here</a>, the dough contains potato, but, as Rosa explains, in spite of this it is meant to be sweet and airy, so her mother’s trick is to add some saccharine to the potato water, and then use some of this to make the potato purée. This allows her to get sweetness into the dough without weighing it down with lots of sugar, so it rises well and stays light.</p>
<p class="indented">To get the timing of the rising of the dough right, she swears by putting a walnut-sized piece of leftover dough in a glass of water. When it rises she knows that she will need to rest the dough for 30 more minutes before baking!</p>
<p class="makes">Makes 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">170g peeled potatoes</p>
<p class="ingredients">5 saccharine tablets</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 eggs, beaten</p>
<p class="ingredients">175g caster sugar</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g strong white bread flour</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g plain flour</p>
<p class="ingredients">50g fresh yeast</p>
<p class="ingredients">75g white pork lard, cut in pieces, plus a little extra for greasing your hands</p>
<p class="ingredients">75g butter, melted plus a little extra for greasing the tray</p>
<p class="ingredients">40g icing sugar</p>
<p class="method">Boil the potatoes in unsalted water until soft and drain into a bowl, so that you reserve the water.</p>
<p class="method">Dissolve the saccharine tablets in a tablespoon of the potato water, then add this to the rest of the water.</p>
<p class="method">Put the potatoes into a separate bowl and mash them, adding 85ml of the potato and saccharine water, then leave to cool.</p>
<p class="method">When the potato purée is cold, stir in 2 of the eggs, then add the sugar and mix well. Sift the flours together and work into the mixture.</p>
<p class="method">In a small bowl or cup, mix the remaining egg and the yeast well, using a fork. Pour this on to the potato mixture, and with your hands mix it in, adding the pieces of lard and melted butter as you go, until you have a homogeneous paste. Cover the bowl with a clean cloth, then put a large freezer bag over the top to keep in the moisture, and leave overnight in ambient temperature.</p>
<p class="method">By morning the dough should have risen, so that if you gently move the bowl, the dough trembles. If this doesn’t happen, leave it a little longer.</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 170°C/gas 3. Grease a baking tray with butter.</p>
<p class="method">Grease your hands with a little lard, then divide the dough into 4 pieces and roll them into long cylinders about 3cm in diameter and 75cm long. Try not to handle the dough too much, so that you don’t interrupt the fermentation process. Coil each cylinder into a tight snail and place on the greased baking tray. Leave to rest, uncovered, for 45 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Sprinkle each coil of dough with 2 teaspoons of icing sugar, then put into the preheated oven and bake for about 30 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.</p>
<p class="method">Remove from the oven, sprinkle each coil with another 2 teaspoons of icing sugar, then leave to cool and enjoy with a hot chocolate (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_32">here</a>) or <em>café con leche</em>.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec10"><a id="pg_48"/>Ensaimada</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Soft dough spiral</p>
<p class="flush_left">A really properly-made <em>ensaimada</em> is my absolute favourite breakfast. Sometimes we rent a <em>boyera</em> (converted barn) in Menorca, and early in the morning I escape to the fish market in Mahón, where I watch and learn from the expert local shoppers as they select the best of the catch. Once I have bought my fish, I slip down to the port, where in the cafés and bars they serve the lightest, squidgiest <em>ensaimadas</em>: coiled buns of airy, yeasty dough, dusted with icing sugar, that you can tear into soft strands to eat with your coffee while you sit and watch the people coming and going in their yachts.</p>
<p class="indented"><em>Ensaimadas</em> were originally a speciality of Mallorca and the ones made there are still considered the ultimate, even though you can find them everywhere nowadays. I like <em>ensaimadas</em> plain, but often they are split and filled with a confit of pumpkin or spaghetti squash, or custard.</p>
<p class="indented">The locals claim it is the damp atmosphere surrounding the islands that makes the dough more moist, so the finished buns stay soft for longer, and they insist that you can’t make them properly anywhere else. They are made with pork lard (<em>saim</em> in Mallorquín means lard), which gives a silky texture to the dough. Made with a different fat they tend to be puffy and don’t melt in the mouth in the same way. We use a fantastic Ibérico lard (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_40">here</a>), which is very different from British lard, and you really do need its ultra-silkiness in order to stretch the dough – if you can’t find it you could try substituting it with English lard blended with some olive oil.</p>
<p class="indented">You do have to do quite a lot of kneading, and much of the finished result depends on how thinly you stretch the dough – it should be almost transparent. It is actually quite astonishing how the addition of the pork lard enables you to stretch a tennis-ball-sized piece into a sheer sheet of dough that will take up most of your kitchen table or work surface. What this size and thinness does is allow you to create more layers as you roll it up, and the more layers you have, the lighter and softer the finished <em>ensaimada</em> will be.</p>
<p class="indented"><a id="pg_49"/>This recipe comes from Rosa María Company Bauza, who is the partner of our Spanish cheese adviser, José Luís Martín. They live on the island of Mallorca with their son, and some of the other recipes in this book, such as the <em>coca</em> bases (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_70">here</a>), are also from her family’s repertoire.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes 6 small <strong><em>ensaimadas</em></strong> or 2 large ones</p>
<p class="ingredients">50g fresh yeast</p>
<p class="ingredients">500g strong white flour, plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="ingredients">150g caster sugar</p>
<p class="ingredients">15g salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 large eggs</p>
<p class="ingredients">olive oil, for greasing your work surface</p>
<p class="ingredients">about 150g pork lard (white or Ibérico), at room temperature, for smearing the dough</p>
<p class="ingredients">icing sugar, for dredging</p>
<p class="method">To start, you need to make a ‘mother’. Melt the yeast in 3 tablespoons of warm water, add 200g of the flour plus enough water to bring the mixture together into a soft dough, and shape into a ball. Put into a bowl and leave to rest for 30 minutes, covered with a damp cloth (don’t let this touch the dough) until doubled in size.</p>
<p class="method">Lift the dough out. Put the sugar, the rest of the flour, the salt and the eggs (unbeaten) into the bowl and mix together. Then return the dough to the bowl and work it into the flour, salt and egg mixture with your hands – you may need to add a little water or extra flour to help it form a smooth, workable dough.</p>
<p class="method">Flour your work surface, turn out the dough and knead it for 30–45 minutes, until it is glossy, silky and extremely elastic. Once you have reached this point, roll it into a ball again and leave it on your work surface, covered with a clean tea towel, for 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Divide the dough into 6 (if you are making small <em>ensaimadas</em>) or 2 (if making large ones) and roll each piece into a rough ball.</p>
<p class="method">Lightly oil the surface on which you will be working – you need a large work area. Also grease a tray or trays with lard.</p>
<p class="method">Roll out each ball individually in one direction only, so that it resembles a long tongue of dough – it should be as long and thin as possible (preferably about 2mm).</p>
<p class="method">With your hand, smear the surface of the dough generously with lard (this will help you to stretch it more easily), then with your fingertips pull and stretch it in all directions, but particularly widthways, as this will allow you to make more turns once you start to roll up the dough). Keep stretching as much as you can, until the dough is almost translucent. This is the fun bit – you will be surprised how much the lard allows the dough to stretch! It will be a bit uneven and wavy around the edge – this doesn’t matter at all – and don’t be scared of making little tears or holes. This doesn’t matter either, as they will mend themselves when the dough rises overnight.</p>
<p class="method">Fold over the long edge by about 1cm to give you a good grip on the dough, then roll it up into a long, thin, snake-like sausage.</p>
<p class="method">Now loosely coil each sausage into a spiral shape on your greased tray or trays, making sure that the edges of the sausage don’t touch each other as you wind them around – you need to leave a gap of 2–3cm, as you are going to let the dough rise again overnight, and it will spread out. If you don’t leave this gap you will lose the definition of the spiral shape as the dough rises.</p>
<p class="method">Put the trays into a closed, switched-off oven overnight (you don’t want any heat, just to keep the air out). By morning the dough will have risen and the gaps in the spirals will have filled up.</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 170°C/gas 3 and bake for around 12 minutes for small <em>ensaimadas</em> or 15 minutes for large ones, until light golden, with a soft-baked top. Dredge with icing sugar.</p>
<h2 class="box-head" id="box2"><a id="pg_50"/>A Tale of Two Jam-makers</h2>
<p class="flush_left">Over the last two decades I have enjoyed so many stunning jams made by Spanish friends and artisan suppliers, as wherever you have fertile land and sunshine, you have glorious fruit, and everyone wants to capture its flavour in a jar – but two people stand out above the crowd.</p>
<p class="indented">I first met Juana Cerezo at a market in Madrid. I was searching the stalls trying to spot a particular cheese-maker when this dark-copper-skinned woman with a long pony-tail insisted that I taste her jams, which are truly stunning. Juana lives in the tiny village of Herguijuela de la Sierra in the middle of nowhere in the province of Salamanca. She comes from a family of twelve siblings and her surname means ‘cherry tree’ (Salamanca is an area famous for cherries). A captivating woman with an infectious energy and un-compromising standards, she has studied to be a teacher and is involved in rural development and community issues.</p>
<p class="indented">The valley in which she lives has a very privileged alpine climate, situated as it is in the national park of Las Batuecas in the Sierra de Francia mountain range, and she uses wild fruits from the woodland and valley as well as her own orchard fruits (cherry, pear, apple, quince, plum, olive, peach, fig and chestnut) and strawberries, raspberries, pumpkins and onions from her garden. Then she puts them together in interesting combinations, such as chestnut and chocolate, coconut and nutmeg, green tomato and apple, and an amazingly deep orange pumpkin with almond.</p>
<p class="indented">It was May time when I first visited her at her home, where she keeps chickens and a goat called Lola, and the surrounding countryside was covered in flowers and fruit blossom. She makes her jams and seasonal <em>membrillo</em> (quince, see <a href="chapter_006.html#pg_511">here</a>) at a little work-station with her daughter, who has helped her pack the jars since she was very small. I very badly wanted to sell her jams at Brindisa, but her production is tiny and her recipes so instinctive that I couldn’t even coax her to write them down for this book.</p>
<p class="indented">I did, however, succeed in collecting some wonderful recipes from Teresa Cotorruela Rodríguez, another of the finest jam-makers I have come across. Teresa makes her jams in the remote area of Sayago in Zamora, only a few miles from Los Arribes del Duero (the canyons of the Duero river), which cross over the border into Portugal. She uses local fruit and calls her little business <a id="pg_51"/><em>Oh Saúco</em> – <em>saúco</em> means elderberry. In the jam-making room of her beautiful low, stone cottage with its walled garden, she has a collection of ports and homemade cherry liqueurs that she adds to many of her jams, which, by their very local nature, can only be made in relatively small batches.</p>
<p class="indented">The three recipes that I have included on <a href="chapter_002.html#p52a">here</a> are my favourites – remember, though, that the ultimate secret of great jam-making is to do as Teresa does, and only use the very best fruit, in season.</p>
<p class="recipe-head2" id="reca1"><a id="pg_52"/>JAMS</p>
<p class="flush_left1">The combination of <em>tostada</em> (toasted white bread) with preserves is as popular in Spain as it is in Britain. The Spanish love jams, but as in Italy or France they tend to be much looser, more runny and made with less sugar than ‘set’ British jams, so the flavour of the fruit comes through more strongly.</p>
<h4 class="c_head" id="p52a">To prepare and fill the jars</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Always use new jars and lids.</p>
<p class="indented">For home consumption Teresa Cotorruela Rodríguez, whose recipes follow, prefers to sterilise her jars before filling them, either by boiling them in a metal pan for ten minutes or putting them through a dishwasher cycle. Then she fills them right up to the top with jam while it is still hot, closes the lid and gives a gentle twist to seal it tightly. She then turns the jars upside down, so they create a vacuum, and leaves them like this until the jam cools. At this point they are ready to eat, but will last for up to three years unopened.</p>
<p class="indented">The alternative, more conventional, way is to use the <em>baño maría</em> (bain-marie) method. Fill the sterilised jars to within a centimetre of the top, put the lids on and then place the jars upright on a small rack or tea towel in a large pan of water, so that the jars are not resting directly on the base of the pan. Wedge a tea towel in between the jars to stop them from bumping into each other. Bring the water to the boil for ten minutes, then lift the jars out carefully, using tongs. The important thing with this method is not to over-fill the jars, or the seal can leak as the contents expand. Check that the domed lid has been pulled down tightly. If it springs back, this shows that the seal has not worked, in which case you can cool the jar, keep it chilled in the fridge and eat the jam within a month.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec11">Mermelada de guindas</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Cherry jam</p>
<p class="flush_left">It is up to you whether you put in the cherry liqueur at the end – but it is an excellent addition.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes around 900g</p>
<p class="ingredients">1kg stoned cherries</p>
<p class="ingredients">450g sugar (half granulated, half caster)</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 cinnamon stick</p>
<p class="ingredients">juice of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="ingredients">cherry liqueur (optional)</p>
<p class="method">Put a plate into the fridge to chill, ready to test whether the jam is set, and prepare your jars (see <a href="chapter_002.html#p52a">here</a>).</p>
<p class="method">Put the cherries into a preserving pan and add the sugar and cinnamon stick plus about 200ml of water – enough to keep the fruit from sticking to the pan. Stir constantly over a low heat and once a small amount of the juice has evaporated, turn up the heat to its highest, add the lemon juice and stir without stopping until the jam reaches its setting point, then take off the heat.</p>
<p class="method">The time this takes can vary, but begin to test when the jam starts thickening. Spoon a teaspoonful on to your chilled plate. Put it back into the fridge for a minute, then push the jam with your finger. If it forms a crinkly skin, it is ready. If not, continue to boil and test again.</p>
<p class="method">Remove the cinnamon stick and then, using a hand whisk, squash the cherries so that they are half ‘chopped’. If you prefer the jam to be smoother you could blend them instead. If you want to add a small amount of cherry liqueur, this is the moment.</p>
<p class="method">Leave to rest for 5 minutes, then fill the prepared jars (see <a href="chapter_002.html#p52a">here</a>).</p>

<p class="method">Wash the lavender sprigs, dry them with kitchen paper, then tie them in muslin.</p>
<p class="method">Once the sugar has completely dissolved and formed a syrup, put the pan over a low heat, add the lavender parcel and stir occasionally. Once the syrup has evaporated enough – it will thicken, become brighter, and come away from the sides of the pan – add the lemon juice and zest, turn up the heat to its highest and stir constantly with a long wooden spoon, to avoid burning, until the jam reaches its setting point, then take off the heat.</p>
<p class="method">The time this takes can vary, but start testing when the jam becomes shiny and thickens. Spoon a teaspoonful on to your chilled plate. Put it back into the fridge for a minute, then push the jam with your finger. If it forms a crinkly skin, it is ready. If not, continue to boil and test again.</p>
<p class="method">Remove the lavender parcel and leave the jam to rest for 5 minutes, then fill the prepared jars (see <a href="chapter_002.html#p52a">here</a>).</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec13">Mermelada de fresas al oporto</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Strawberry jam with port</p>
<p class="flush_left">I know we are all familiar with strawberry jam, but the addition of port makes it very special – the area of Sayago where Teresa lives is only a few miles from the Portuguese border, so port is a very familiar drink locally. Sometimes she uses lemon instead of port but we decided to try it using both, and found it worked really well.</p>
<p class="indented">This is a silky, rich jam, especially if you are using over-ripe fruit, but if you prefer a firmer texture you could add a little more lemon juice. As well as serving it in conventional ways, it is also delicious with pâté.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes about 700g</p>
<p class="ingredients">1kg ripe strawberries</p>
<p class="ingredients">450g sugar (half granulated, half caster)</p>
<p class="ingredients">zest and juice of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="ingredients">65ml good-quality port</p>
<p class="method">Put a plate into the fridge to chill, ready to test whether the jam is set, and prepare your jars (see <a href="chapter_002.html#p52a">here</a>).</p>
<p class="method">Put the fruit into a large preserving pan with the sugar and allow to macerate for about 30 minutes, until the fruit has released its juices.</p>
<p class="method">Stir over a low heat to release more juice and once most of this has evaporated (about forty minutes), add the lemon juice and zest. Increase the heat to its highest and boil until it reaches its setting point. The time this takes can vary, but should be about 15–20 minutes, so start testing after ten minutes. Spoon a teaspoonful on to your chilled plate. Put it back into the fridge for a minute, then push the jam with your finger. If it forms a crinkly skin, it is ready. If not, continue to boil and test again a few minutes later – but be careful not to let the jam begin to burn on the bottom of the pan, or the colour will become dark and the taste more caramel-like.</p>
<p class="method">At this point, add the port, stir briefly and turn off the heat. Leave to rest for 5 minutes, then fill the prepared jars (see <a href="chapter_002.html#p52a">here</a>).</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec14"><a id="pg_54"/>Crema de almendras marcona</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Almond butter</p>
<p class="flush_left">Not traditionally Spanish, perhaps, but made with beautiful Spanish almonds and olive oil, this is gorgeous on toast, and even better with some orange blossom honey (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_56">here</a>) drizzled over the top. This is another recipe from Scott Boden. I guess being Anglo-American, his mission was to make an equivalent to peanut butter using a Spanish almond (and at home we also use it in any way you might use peanut butter or tahini, in a satay-style sauce, in cookies, even a spoonful added to a bean or vegetable stew or curry). Scott made various versions with different varieties of nut, which we compared and decided that, although expensive, the Marcona delivered the richest, most pronounced almondy flavour. Any of the butter that you don’t use immediately will keep in a cool larder (or a fridge in summer) for 3 months – but Scott recommends you just eat it all straight away.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes about 500g</p>
<p class="ingredients">500g good blanched almonds, preferably Marcona</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon good olive oil, such as Arbequina</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon vegetable oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon bittersweet smoked paprika (<strong><em>pimentón agridulce</em></strong>)</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 150°C/gas 2.</p>
<p class="method">Spread out the almonds on a large shallow tray and toast for 10–12 minutes until lightly golden brown, turning them once halfway through.</p>
<p class="method">While the almonds are still warm from the oven, combine half of them with the other ingredients in a food processor. Process until very smooth and runny (approximately 4–5 minutes).</p>
<p class="method">Add the remaining almonds and process for about 45 seconds, or longer if you prefer a smooth rather than crunchy texture.</p>
<p class="method">Smear thickly on toasted country bread.</p>

<p class="square-subhead">‘from flowers, woodland trees or mountain shrubs’</p>
<p class="flush_left">Spanish artisan honey can be amazing since the bees have such a vast expanse of unspoilt countryside to forage on, from forest and wilderness to hills and meadows filled with a whole range of aromatic flowers, shrubs and trees. The honeys truly reflect the countryside in which they are collected, unlike those made by large-scale commercial companies which combine honeys from different sources. Where producers situate their hives in areas of mixed flora, their honey is labelled as ‘diverse’, while honeys that come from regions where one particular flower, herb or tree dominates can be labelled as ‘single varietals’, and will have an especially distinctive flavour.</p>
<p class="indented">In the early days of Moro restaurant our friends Sam and Sam Clark served their homemade yogurt with three of these very special honeys: the almost-black <em>madroño</em> (strawberry tree), the copper-coloured <em>castaño</em> (chestnut) and the golden <em>azahar</em> (orange blossom). It was such a lovely, simple way to highlight their flavours and very different hues, which showed beautifully against the bright white of the yogurt.</p>
<p class="indented">Honey is a food with a long history and ancient importance in Spain. There is a famous painting in the Cuevas de la Araña, the Spider Caves, near Bicorp in Valencia, which is around 8,000 years old and shows a figure, known as the ‘Man of Bicorp’, climbing high up to raid <em>miel de</em> <em>serrania</em> (wild honey) from a nest of bees.</p>
<p class="indented">We select our honey from Ferran Alemany and his family, who live up in the hills of the province of Lleida outside Barcelona in the foothills of the Pyrenees, a place full of almond groves and horses, and quite magical when the trees are in blossom and there are young foals gambolling around. Ferran’s grandfather, Miquel Alemany, began collecting honey back in 1929, and every year the production builds up to a crescendo when they make their beautiful <em>turrón</em> (nougat) with honey and almonds in time for the Christmas season.</p>
<p class="indented">In addition to their own honeys, they also collect diverse and single varietals from other producers around Spain. Some, such as the heather honeys, are processed ‘raw’, i.e. they are extracted from the comb without any pasteurisation or heat treatment, only enough warmth to allow the honey to move. They are not filtered either, so may contain small amounts of pollen, then they are simply jarred and settled. As a result they are very different from fully pasteurised honeys, which may have been heated to as high as 85°C and then chilled down fast to about 25°C. This harsh treatment can cause the honey to lose nutritional value and much of its complexity: caramel and vanilla notes will fade, floral and herbal aromas will evaporate, and the <a id="pg_58"/>quality will be short-lived. By contrast, a gently handled, artisan honey will retain its natural, individual flavour – more aromatic than sweet – its high mineral and protein content, and the energy-giving and antiseptic properties that country people have long valued in tonics and natural remedies.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_57"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg057.jpg"/></div>
<h4 class="c_head">How to choose honeys</h4>
<p class="flush_left">As a general rule, tree honeys are darker than the more golden flower ones, partly because there is a higher protein content in their nectar. This, combined with the natural sugars, creates a darker pigment and a toasted aroma, which makes the honeys excellent for homemade granola and nut-based recipes.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">The most distinctive tree honey comes from the <em>castaño</em> (chestnut), which blooms in larger forests around Galicia and Asturias, and in smaller quantities in the Montseny mountains of Catalunya. It produces dark greeny-amber- coloured, slightly malty, aromatic honey with a strong dry-wood intensity and a mild, bitter finish.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">The evergreen holm oak produces a honey that is very viscous, almost black in colour, but with a mild flavour, in Aragón, Salamanca and Catalunya.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">Then there is <em>madroño</em>, from the strawberry tree, which has no relation to the fruit as we know it, but does produce little berries that are not dissimilar in appearance to the wild strawberry. The tree is so well known in Spain that the coat of arms of the city of Madrid actually shows a bear reaching up for the berries. The honey produced from <em>madroño</em> pollen is the darkest of all, and has an unusual, especially bitter flavour that is good with yogurt.</p>
<p class="flush_left1"><em>Eucalipto</em> (eucalyptus) honey tastes almost like good medicine, and its balsamic properties give a strong soothing finish that nurses the back of your throat.</p>
<p class="flush_left1"><em>Brezo</em> (heather) is a plant we associate more with Scotland, but it can be found in a certified organic area of the Cantabrian mountains, where the hives are positioned 1,100 metres above sea level in areas of mixed woodland and meadow. The honey is collected from five different varieties of heather and has a unique thick, jelly-caramel-like texture that is similar to the famous manuka honey from New Zealand. It has an exceptionally high protein content – close to 2 per cent, compared to 0.5 per cent for most honeys.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">The lavender (<em>espliego</em>) plant, with its grey-greenish leaves, strong camphor aroma and violet flowers, blooms in the summer around La Mancha, and the honey is light amber and very aromatic, wonderful for making cakes or spreading on toasted bread.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">Rosemary (<em>romero</em>) honey comes from Catalunya, Aragón and Valencia, and has a mild sweetness with a touch of acidity and definite bitter tones.</p>
<p class="flush_left1"><em>Azahar</em> (orange blossom) honey from Valencia and Tarragona is beautiful with fresh cheeses such as Mató and young goat’s cheeses.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">Royal jelly is sometimes added to the honey, but be aware that 90 per cent of this is sourced in China. If you find a honey made with local Spanish royal jelly this will add quite a bit to its price.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">The Canary Islands produce some excellent honeys, and here you may also come across <em>guarapa</em>, or ‘<em>miel de palma</em>’, which is not bee honey but the sap of the Canary palm tree, more like maple syrup (you have to tap the tree for it in the same way). However, it is used just like honey, especially with junkets, fresh white cheeses and <em>gofio</em> (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_60">here</a>). Like honey, too, it is high in mineral content and is often used in remedies.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec15"><a id="pg_59"/>Coca de yogur</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Yogurt cake</p>
<p class="method">This recipe is from a friend of Àngel Puigsellosas, who makes our <em>coca</em> breads in Catalunya (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_70">here</a>), and in this case, as is typical in his region, he also uses the word <em>coca</em> to describe a cake. Although the ingredients are similar to those in the recipe for muffins (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_43">here</a>) the texture is much lighter and fluffier, almost pillowy, thanks to the addition of meringue. Again, the idea is to use a 125g/150ml yogurt pot for measuring, but I have also given the equivalent standard weights and measures.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes 1 cake, around 32cm x 22cm</p>
<p class="ingredients">a little butter, for greasing the tin</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 large eggs or 4 small ones</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 yogurt pot measures of caster sugar (285g)</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 natural yogurt (125g)</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 yogurt pot measure of olive oil (150ml)</p>
<p class="ingredients">a dash of vanilla extract</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 yogurt pot measures of plain flour (225g), plus a little extra, for dusting the tin</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon baking powder</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas 4.</p>
<p class="method">Grease and flour a cake tin (roughly 32cm x 22cm).</p>
<p class="method">Separate the eggs and beat the whites until you have soft peaks, then beat in the sugar until you have a quite stiff meringue.</p>
<p class="method">Mix in the yolks, then incorporate the yogurt, olive oil and vanilla extract.</p>
<p class="method">Finally, fold in the flour and baking powder and spoon into the tin, levelling the top.</p>
<p class="method">Bake in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Leave in the tin for a few minutes until cool enough to handle, then turn out and cool on a rack.</p>

<p class="square-subhead">‘vital and sustaining’</p>
<p class="flush_left"><em>Gofio</em> is maize flour that has been toasted so that it is almost caramelised. Occasionally you find it in recipes in mainland Spain, but there its presence is quite limited. In the Canary Islands, however, it is a vital and sustaining carbohydrate, the rough equivalent of mealie meal in many African nations (in fact, much <em>gofio</em> is sold to Africa), and is similar in taste and texture to <em>tsampa</em> from Tibet.</p>
<p class="indented">In times gone by, if you were a shepherd out with the goats in the hills you might have some cheese in your pocket and some <em>gofio</em> to mix into a paste with water, and that is how you would get by. At one time you might even have eaten it from a leaf, in the African way. And when villagers went off to work in the banana or tobacco plantations they would take with them a nourishing mid-morning drink of <em>gofio</em> and honey or sugar, mixed into goat’s milk, along with dried figs and nuts.</p>
<p class="indented">Most children grow up eating <em>gofio</em> porridge, perhaps mixed with honey and bananas; but it is also added to soups or stews as a thickener; mixed with water, nuts, rum or olive oil and kneaded into a loaf-shaped dough (<em>pella de gofio</em>), which is sliced, rather like polenta (though not baked); or used like fine breadcrumbs or flour for coating fish before frying. On one visit to Gran Canaria, farmer and cheese-maker Juan Alonso took me up into the hills to see the sheep, goats and the few cattle he farmed. His wife worked the night shift in the local hospital and so when he came home after working the land all day, he told me that for a quick supper he would make <em>agua hervida</em>, which basically means ‘boiled water’, with a bit of thyme or <em>hierba luisa</em>, lemon verbena from the garden, then he would throw in some <em>gofio</em> to thicken the liquid into a kind of soupy paste.</p>
<p class="indented">However, <em>gofio</em> is also being re-invented in ever more interesting and experimental ways in contemporary restaurant cooking, where it is appearing in <a id="_idTextAnchor000"/><em>tortillas</em>, mousses, meringues, ice creams, milkshakes, savoury purées and fish and vegetable dishes. At one island restaurant I was served <em>gofio</em> mixed with meat stock, parsley and spices to make a dip called <em>gofio escaldón</em>, which is similar to the traditional <em>gachas</em> (pastes) you find in La Mancha. I was given a big slice of raw, sweet Spanish onion to scoop up the dip, so the crunchy, juicy, clean onion flavoured the relatively flavourless paste. At the end of another meal I also tried <em>mousse de</em> <em>gofio</em>, in which the toasted <em>gofio</em> was mixed with whipping cream, egg whites, sugar, ground almonds and cinnamon to make a light nutty mousse which was quite sweet and really delicious – it reminded me of Horlicks or the inside of a Malteser.</p>
<p class="indented">The tradition of <em>gofio</em> in the islands goes way back to the times when the Canarian aborigines, the Guanches, inhabited the islands, living in the <a id="pg_62"/>volcanic caves. They were said to have been tall and blue-eyed, possibly a mixed race of Berbers from North Africa and Vikings. In the museum in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria you can see the old utensils they used for making and eating <em>gofio</em>: storage containers, roasters for toasting the grain, large <em>tinajas</em>, or jars, with wooden lids for storing it once it was pounded, and ceramic <em>ganigos</em> (flat bowls for making stews).</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_61"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg061.jpg"/></div>
<p class="indented">When you wander through the hills of Gran Canaria, you can often see small, stunningly beautiful patterns made up of geometric lines and shapes marking the rock over doorways that lead into old caves where the islanders once kept their stores of <em>gofio</em> and sometimes cheese. Each clan created their own little emblem and would make stamps, called <em>pintaderas,</em> out of baked clay or sometimes wood, into which they cut the geometric patterns. The stamps were dipped in dye and were also used to brand animals and any other treasures the people owned. The designs are so central to Canarian history that you often see them reproduced on T-shirts for selling to holidaymakers.</p>
<p class="indented">These days many of the old caves have a chimney poking through, because a popular thing to do here, as in mountainous areas of mainland Spain, is convert them into dens for big family gatherings on Sundays and holidays. People put in a grill for barbecuing, a long table and chairs and maybe even a little wine store.</p>
<p class="indented">Over the years <em>gofio</em> has been made from many different grains and sometimes legumes such as dried <em>arvejas</em> and <em>chicharos</em> (types of pea) and <em>habas</em> (broad beans). <em>Trigo</em> (wheat) and <em>millo</em> (maize/corn, which has arrived more recently from America) are the most popular these days. In general, <em>gofio de trigo</em> is lighter in colour and finer, so is more suited to breakfast porridge made with milk, while the heavier <em>gofio de millo</em> is often used for making a paste, and for adding to stews and soups.</p>
<p class="indented">Many local mills now provide a full bespoke service of stone milling and toasting the grains to individual requirements. Outsiders to the islands might find it difficult to understand why the Canarian people are so particular about a certain variety or grade of <em>gofio</em>, but once you have tasted a few, you begin to understand the difference and develop a preference.</p>
<p class="indented">Juan was very insistent about which <em>gofio</em> I should bring home with me. The one he recommended, Buen Lugar, was a <em>gofio de millo</em> made from Argentino (an Argentinian strain of corn) and it was a revelation to me: a beautiful soft beige/golden colour with a taste full of all those Horlicks flavours with hints of toffee. We mix it with porridge or make it into a paste with water and add it to yogurt. We have even used it to make brunch pancakes – not typically Canarian, but just making good use of a very typical ingredient.</p>
<p class="indented"><em>Gofio</em> isn’t easy to find in the UK, but if you come across it, try these childhood favourites of a former Canarian colleague, Eduardo.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Breakfast shake</h4>
<p class="flush_left">This also makes a great after-gym drink. For one person blend 2 dessertspoons of <em>gofio</em> (no more as it thickens the drink very quickly) with 1–2 teaspoons of muscovado sugar or organic honey, 1 sliced banana (or half an avocado or a wedge of fresh coconut, chopped), a handful of blanched almonds and 200–300ml of milk, until smooth. Substitute almond milk, coconut or soya milk, as you like.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Gofio amasado</h4>
<p class="flush_left">These are little rounds of <em>gofio</em>, fruit and nuts, a favourite childhood snack for days out with the family in the countryside. For enough for 4 people, infuse 3 cloves in 300ml water for 15 minutes, remove the cloves and mix 4 tablespoons of honey into the water. Put 500–700g <em>gofio</em> in a bowl and slowly add enough honeyed water to work into a firm but sticky dough. Mix in 2 handfuls each of chopped nuts and dried fruit of your choice, form into little balls and then dust in a little more <em>gofio</em>.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec16"><a id="pg_63"/>Pan perdido de Adolfo</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Adolfo’s ‘lost’ spiced loaf</p>
<p class="method">Adolfo Zuazua Iglesias and María Valdés García have a ‘vegetarian casa rural’ in Cabo de Gata in Almería in Andalucía – an unrenovated eighteenth-century farmhouse, where the ceiling is made from woven bamboo, and swallows fly freely through the house. The whole place smells of the rosemary and orange blossom which grows all around and the wild scenery is mind-blowing.</p>
<p class="indented">The couple have a simple, healthy philosophy when it comes to eating: use the best-quality ingredients that cause little or no harm to the environment and combine them with <em>mucho amor</em>.</p>
<p class="indented">When Rupert and I stayed there, Adolfo, who does most of the cooking and baking, was delighted to give me the recipe for this loaf made with ginger, spice and dried fruit. He calls this the lost loaf because he always keeps back a little of each loaf he bakes, which might otherwise get left over or ‘lost’, and then uses it as the stale bread required to make the next one. It is an ancient habit that our generation, with our wasteful kitchen habits, would perhaps do well to follow. As well as being thrifty, the stale bread adds that extra little bit of flavour to the new loaf. It is especially delicious toasted and spread with goat’s curd or crème fraîche.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes 1 loaf</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g stale wholemeal bread, torn into chunks</p>
<p class="ingredients">275ml milk</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 cloves</p>
<p class="ingredients">a little oil or butter, for greasing the tin</p>
<p class="ingredients">a little flour, for dusting the tin</p>
<p class="ingredients">130g strong bread flour</p>
<p class="ingredients">150ml olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 eggs, beaten</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g apricot jam</p>
<p class="ingredients">¼ teaspoon baking powder</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</p>
<p class="ingredients">1½ teaspoons ground ginger</p>
<p class="ingredients">70g chopped dried prunes</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 good eating apple, peeled, cored and chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">70g mixed raisins/sultanas and dried berries, such as blueberries, cranberries, sour cherries, blackcurrants, etc.</p>
<p class="ingredients">50g blanched almonds, preferably Marcona</p>
<p class="method">Soak the dry bread in the milk with the cloves for 1–2 hours until it is pliable, then drain off the milk and keep to one side, removing the cloves. Squeeze out the bread.</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 200°C/gas 6. Grease a 21cm loaf tin with oil or butter and dust with flour.</p>
<p class="method">Put the soaked, squeezed bread in a bowl and mix in the flour, oil, beaten eggs and the jam. Beat, adding as much of the drained milk as necessary, until you have a light dough/batter.</p>
<p class="method">Add the baking powder and the rest of the ingredients. Leave to rest for 10–15 minutes, until the dough has risen a little.</p>
<p class="method">Spoon the dough/batter into the prepared tins. Put into the preheated oven and bake for 10 minutes, then lower the temperature to 180°C/gas 4 for about 25 minutes. The loaf will be solid, with a bread pudding-like texture. Leave to cool in the tin for about 15 minutes, then turn out and finish cooling on a wire rack.</p>

<p class="flush_left">This is a savoury-sweet <em>coca</em> (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_70">here</a>) from Mallorca, made from a potato dough with pieces of <em>sobrasada</em> (soft <em>chorizo</em>) – spelled <em>sobrassada</em> in the local Mallorquín dialect – pushed into it, along with fresh fruit. It is astonishingly light despite the quantity of potato, lard and egg, and makes a great weekend brunch when you might have a little more time on your hands, as it does require a bit of work.</p>
<p class="indented">You really need to eat it on the day you make it, as it will become stale quite quickly – but actually it is so good, that is not difficult!</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 6–8</p>
<p class="ingredients">300g floury potatoes</p>
<p class="ingredients">30g fresh yeast</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 medium eggs</p>
<p class="ingredients">175g caster sugar</p>
<p class="ingredients">150g lard</p>
<p class="ingredients">pinch of sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">500–600g strong flour</p>
<p class="ingredients">150g <strong><em>sobrasada,</em></strong> ideally <strong><em>de Mallorca</em></strong>, broken up</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 fresh plums or apricots, sliced (skin on)</p>
<p class="method">Boil the potatoes in their skins until they are tender and the skins are splitting, then drain and leave in a colander to steam. Once the potatoes have cooled enough to handle comfortably, peel off their skins, remove any ‘eyes’ or discoloured parts, and keep the potatoes to one side.</p>
<p class="method">In a cup, dissolve the yeast in 1½ tablespoons of warm water.</p>
<p class="method">Break the eggs into a large mixing bowl, add 150g of the sugar and beat together.</p>
<p class="method">Put the lard into a pan and heat gently to melt it, then add to the eggs and sugar. Stir in the dissolved yeast. Next add the salt and the warm boiled potatoes, breaking them up with your fingers as you put them in, and mix all together well with a wooden spoon. It doesn’t matter at this stage if the potatoes are still lumpy.</p>
<p class="method">Weigh out 500g of strong flour initially, and with one hand add it slowly to the mixture while you work the dough with the fingers of the other hand. Keep adding handfuls of flour until you have a soft dough – you may need to add a little more flour.</p>
<p class="method">Turn out the dough on to a floured surface and knead for 5 minutes, again adding extra flour if the dough feels too sticky.</p>
<p class="method">Line a deep baking tray with baking paper and press the dough out over the surface. Arrange the pieces of <em>sobrasada</em> and plum or apricot over the dough, alternating them in a chequerboard fashion (or as decoratively as you like), and leave to rise in a warm place for 2 hours.</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 200°C/gas 6.</p>
<p class="method">Mix the remaining sugar with a tablespoon of water and brush over the top. Put into the preheated oven, then lower the temperature to 180°C/gas 4 and bake for around 30 minutes, until risen and the crust is golden. The paprika-soaked fat will have run out of the <em>sobrasada</em> and down the sides of the <em>coca</em>. Take out of the oven and lift from the tray using the baking paper; leave to cool on a rack.</p>

<p class="recipe-subhead"><em>Sobrasada</em> pastry horns</p>
<p class="flush_left">A speciality of Menorca, <em>banyeta</em> is Menorquín (a dialect of Catalan) for ‘little horn’, which refers to the shape of the pastry and also to a children’s storybook character of the same name who sometimes appears as a puppet and looks like a little devil with horns. The soft, spreading <em>chorizo</em> <em>sobrasada</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#p260a">here</a>) is a great ingredient for baking, and can be used in the same way as sausage meat.</p>
<p class="indented">This recipe makes a lot of <em>banyetes</em>, but once made up, you can freeze what you don’t need immediately, then just defrost and bake them.</p>
<p class="indented">You could also make an alternative ‘pinwheel’ version, which is a little easier to shape, and which Scott Boden came up with when experimenting with this recipe. He suggests rolling out the dough into one rectangle, 2–3mm thick, then turning it so that the short side is facing you and spreading the <em>sobrasada</em> over half the dough. Sprinkle with some dried oregano, then roll up firmly like a Swiss roll, slice into rounds of 1–1.5cm thick, using a sharp knife, and bake as in the recipe here.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes around 65</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g <strong><em>sobrasada</em></strong></p>
<p class="ingredients">125ml olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">125ml <strong><em>fino</em></strong> sherry</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon caster sugar</p>
<p class="ingredients">425g plain flour, plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 egg, beaten</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 170ºC/Gas 3.</p>
<p class="method">Roll the <em>sobrasada</em> into a thin sausage, about 2cm in diameter, and with a sharp knife cut into rounds about 8mm thick. Keep to one side. Mix all the ingredients, except the <em>sobrasada</em> and beaten egg, into a firm dough, then roll out on a floured surface to 2–3mm thick.</p>
<p class="method">Use a cutter or small glass (about 5cm in diameter) to stamp out circles. Place a disc of <em>sobrasada</em> on each circle, just to one side of the centre, damp all around the edge with a little water, then fold the dough over to make half-moon shapes. Press all around the edges to seal, then take each end between your fingertips and twist and pinch them, curving them inwards to create the ‘little horns’. Place on a baking tray, or trays, and brush with beaten egg.</p>
<p class="method">Bake in the preheated oven for about 18 minutes, until light golden. Leave the <em>banyetas</em> to cool on the tray before lifting them off.</p>

<p class="recipe-subhead">Hot grilled <em>chorizo</em> rolls</p>
<p class="flush_left">At our Chorizo Grill outside the Borough Market shop, we have been making <em>bollos de chorizo a la parrilla</em> – hot rolls with sizzling grilled <em>chorizo</em> and <em>piquillo</em> peppers (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_275a">here</a>) – from mid-morning to lunchtime for over fifteen years and they are one of the most popular things we sell: world famous in fact, since, amazingly, they have even featured in newspaper articles in America, Italy and Japan. For each person, you need a bread roll, cut in half, a cooking <em>chorizo,</em> cut in half lengthways, a <em>piquillo</em> pepper from a jar and a handful of rocket leaves.</p>
<p class="indented">Preheat the grill, then toast the bread. Grill the <em>chorizo</em> halves for about 3 minutes, turning halfway through (if you have a griddle pan, you can get a nice criss-crossing effect as you do this). Sandwich the bread around the rocket leaves, pepper and <em>chorizo</em> and eat immediately.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec20">Panecillos de mantequilla</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Mini butter rolls</p>
<p class="flush_left">Pilar, of the Gutiérrez de la Vega winery in Valencia (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_190">here</a>), makes these rich little rolls with a touch of sugar, which are a perfect foil for <em>foie gras</em> topped with her Moscatel jelly. They are also excellent with Ibérico ham, pâtés and blue cheeses.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes around 25</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 large eggs</p>
<p class="ingredients">500g strong white flour</p>
<p class="ingredients">50g fresh yeast</p>
<p class="ingredients">50g caster sugar</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">about 275ml milk</p>
<p class="ingredients">10g unsalted butter, softened</p>
<p class="method">Beat one of the eggs. Place the flour in a bowl, make a well in the centre and put in the yeast, sugar, salt and the beaten egg. Warm the milk to tepid – don’t overheat it, or the heat will kill the yeast – and add it slowly to the flour mixture, mixing to a soft dough that you can knead easily (you may need more or less milk).</p>
<p class="method">Transfer the dough to a bowl. Cover with a clean cloth and leave in a warm place for 30 minutes, until doubled in size.</p>
<p class="method">Now add half the softened butter, working it into the dough, then knead it again, put it back into the bowl, and rest it, covered as before, for another 15 minutes, until it doubles in size again.</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas 4.</p>
<p class="method">Work the remaining butter into the dough, knead it again and put it back into the bowl. Cover with the cloth and this time leave the dough to rise for 30–45 minutes, until its size has increased by half again (i.e. it is now three times its original size). Take walnut-sized pieces of the dough and form them into rounds. Place on a greased baking tray. Beat the remaining egg and brush lightly over each round, then bake in the preheated oven for about 20 minutes, until a rich golden brown.</p>

<p class="square-subhead">‘ it can be a revelation’</p>
<p class="flush_left">Often it is hard to discover the true diversity of Spanish breads, hidden as they tend to be by more standardised loaves. Since Franco’s time many traditional varieties of grain have been supplanted by newer more ‘productive’ ones, and modern factory techniques dominate, so local, handed-down recipes are sometimes hard to find outside the home or small bakeries, and some have been forgotten completely, or are only made on special saints’ days. However, many do still exist, and when you come across a real regional <em>pan artesano</em> (artisan bread) it can be a revelation. I am thinking particularly of the beautiful <em>pan de coca</em> of Catalunya; or, in Castilla, the golden <em>pan sobado</em> with its distinctive patterns marked in the crust, and a tight, absorbent texture that is perfect for the typical garlic and bread soup of this part of Spain, <em>sopa castellana</em>. Here too you find the light and airy <em>pan de hogaza</em>, and <em>torta de aceite</em>. Not to be confused with the thin Andalusian biscuit of the same name, this <em>torta</em> is a flat, bronze-coloured spongy loaf about 5cm high, which can either be round or long. It is similar to an Italian <em>focaccia</em>, as it is made with olive oil in the dough, then coated with more oil before baking, to give it an attractive gleam.</p>
<p class="indented">At one time, in every region the style of bread would have been dictated by the variety of cereal that was traditionally grown there. Wheat was often supplemented by barley (<em>cebada</em>), rye (<em>centeno</em>), which was popular in the high mountains of the north; oats (<em>avena</em>), millet (<em>mijo</em>), or maize (<em>maíz</em>), which was introduced from central America in the sixteenth century, particularly into the green land of Galicia with its abundant rain. And on the north coast flour would often be made from chestnuts from the forests, as well as with grains.</p>
<p class="indented">The Galicians, Castilians and Levantines were particularly known for their speciality breads, and the regions are still dotted with mills – originally wind-driven in La Mancha, and water-driven in Galicia and most other areas. In Galicia many of the old breads, including corn bread and potato bread, still survive, and they boast the only Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) bread in Spain, a country-style loaf with a thick crust called <em>pan de Cea</em>, made with one of the many local varieties of wheat. Cea is a little village in the province of Ourense, and the bread has a documented history stretching back to the thirteenth century.</p>
<p class="indented">The province of Zamora in Castilla y León was especially renowned for its exceptional wheat and flour, and this is possibly why one area is called Tierra del Pan, ‘the land of bread’. Until around 30–40 years ago the variety of wheat grown throughout Castilla y León was the local and historic <em>candeal</em>, which produced high-quality, very fine white flour that made very close-textured, dense, bright-white bread capable of lasting a good 10–15 days. However, in recent years the bread-making industry has designed more productive strains and crosses and it has become harder for farmers to justify growing <em>candeal</em>, which works out at around 30 per cent more expensive to use. So it has reduced considerably in cultivation and will only increase again if it can gain more recognition in specialist breads such as <em>pan sobado</em>.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_69"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg069.jpg"/></div>
<p class="indented">In the old days wood-fired baking ovens were sometimes owned communally, or by the local baker, who would take in the trays of dough made by each family and bake the bread for an entire village. On Saturday night you might also take along a lamb or suckling pig to be roasted in the wood-fired oven. In some places you can still do this. My brother, Mark, had his wedding meal of roasted local lamb baked in this way in the bakers’ oven in Santa Maria d’Oló in Moianès in Catalunya.</p>
<p class="recipe-head"><a id="pg_70"/>Coca</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Flatbread or ‘cake’</p>
<p class="flush_left1"><em>Coca</em> is a broad term given to a host of different flatbreads made to many recipes along the whole of the Levantine coast, from the French border to south of Alicante, and reaching inland to Lleida.</p>
<p class="indented">Some are very simple, some quite complex, some are made with savoury toppings, like pizza, others are sweet, perfect with coffee mid-morning, and might be flavoured with anise and/or slender, creamy Mediterranean pine nuts (<em>coca de pinyons)</em>. Often in bakeries a <em>coca de pinyons</em> will be in the form of one long, doughy piece, shaped a little like a tongue, so known as <em>una lengua</em>, which will be cut into pieces for you, whatever size you want – and you will be charged by the weight. A popular variation is to add an extra layer of dough to the base to create a slim pocket filled with <em>crema catalana</em> (custard). Or, especially in Catalunya, you see more brittle versions that snap like <em>langues de chat</em> biscuits. Sometimes they are sprayed lightly with anisette before baking, which gives a lovely refreshing edge to the flavour.</p>
<p class="indented">Our friend Pilar, of the Gutiérrez de la Vega winery in Alicante, makes <em>coca de mollitas</em>, a local variation in which the base is spread with melted chocolate and a crumble-type topping flavoured with white wine.</p>
<p class="indented">Other <em>coques</em> are more cakey in texture – in fact, in parts of Spain the word <em>coca</em> applies to some kinds of cake (see <a href="chapter_002.html#rec15">here</a>, <em>coca de yogur</em>). And there are often special ones for celebrating a saint’s day, such as the <em>coca de San Joan</em>, made with a puffy, round, brioche-like dough, pine nuts and sugared fruit.</p>
<p class="indented">However, you can also find the plain bread, <em>pan de coca</em>, which is shaped like an elongated espadrille and is usually made with a yeasty ‘starter culture’ or ‘mother’, so it puffs up quite thickly. For a while it was a somewhat forgotten bread, much harder to find than its sweet or pizza-like counterparts, but a handful of artisan bakers are spearheading its revival, notably one unrelenting perfectionist, who is the baker and <em>coquero</em> (<em>coca</em> maker) in the village of Folgueroles near Vic. Since a good <em>pan de coca</em> is quite the most heavenly bread I have ever eaten it is very appropriate that his name is Àngel!</p>
<p class="indented">Àngel Puigsellosas makes his <em>pan de coca</em> a full metre long. Soft and delicate, yet typically crispy-crunchy on the outside, it is sweet yet salty, somewhere between a <em>focaccia</em> and a <em>ciabatta</em> in texture, but really a bread that has a character all of its own. It is perfect for tomato bread (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_72">here</a>) because it is so long-lasting – especially if you keep it in the fridge, and because it freezes beautifully, Àngel is able to send us his breads all the way to Brindisa. You can slice the bread widthways along its full length if you are really skilled, or cut it into 15cm slices and then split it and toast it ready for painting with tomato and extra virgin olive oil.</p>
<p class="indented">Àngel comes from a long line of <em>panaderos</em> but has really pioneered his own signature <em>coca</em>, made with his special bespoke mix of cake flour with a blend of sugars and salts. The dough is <a id="pg_71"/>mixed slowly and gently, using purified water at a specific temperature. Àngel likes to employ women in the bakery, as he believes they have a softer touch; and his philosophy is also that the well-being of the baker is reflected in the bread, so everyone works a more sociable eight-hour day, while still baking two batches of bread, rather than the extreme hours that bakers are often required to keep.</p>
<p class="indented">Once the dough is mixed and portioned for the first fermentation stage, the room becomes quite magical and silent, with a special whiteness about it from the flour dusted over the work surfaces and the white light filtering through the blinds. Next, the characteristic <em>rombo</em> marking is pressed into the top of each loaf, then these are rested again before being carefully stretched to more than double their original length. This is the most delicate stage of the process, as any heavy-handed touch could cause the bread to lose the air that gives it its special texture, and damage the creation of that firm but light crust.</p>
<p class="indented">Once stretched, the breads are rested again and at last the quiet of the bakery is broken by the sound of the <em>dosificadora</em> machine sprinkling them with olive oil ready for baking.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Leftover bread</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Many recipes in Spanish cooking were originally designed to use up dried-out bread, as, especially in rural areas, it wasn’t possible to buy fresh loaves every day, so they would be eked out. Tomato bread (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_72">here</a>), <em>gazpacho</em> and <em>salmorejo</em> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#reca4">here</a> and <a href="chapter_003.html#rec56">here</a>) are all based on using up bread that is a few days old, as is <em>torrijas de leche,</em> in which the slices are soaked in cinnamon and lemon-scented milk until soft, then drained, coated with beaten egg, deep-fried in olive oil and sprinkled with sugar.</p>
<p class="indented">Stale bread is also important for making breadcrumbs (<em>migas</em>, see <a href="chapter_002.html#rec22">here</a>), and there is even a word, <em>rebozados</em>, which describes something that is coated in breadcrumbs and fried, such as <em>croquetas</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#recb6">here</a>).</p>
<div class="diamond-image"><a id="pg_72"/><img alt="image" class="width50" src="../images/pg072.jpg"/></div>
<p class="square-subhead">‘a universal food’</p>
<p class="flush_left">If there is such a thing as a universal breakfast and any-time snack, it has to be <em>pan con tomate</em>: tomato bread, or <em>pa amb tomaquet</em> as it is called in Catalunya and <em>pamboli amb tomàtiga</em> in the Balearics. Originally the addition of tomato to bread and oil was the choice of the north, but over the years it has become fashionable in homes all over the country, where each morning families are busily rubbing toasted bread with halved tomatoes and olive oil before going off to work or school. Then later in the day in the tapas bars and restaurants it will appear again, topped with the likes of anchovies, cured ham or grilled meats and vegetables (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_131">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">You might think that not much variation is possible, given so few ingredients are involved, but inevitably everyone in every region has a different view on how to make tomato bread. Sometimes the bread is toasted, sometimes not. I prefer the tomatoes to be squashed into the bread, but in some regions the tomato might be grated or puréed and then treated as a spread, and if you ask for <em>pan con tomate</em> in some parts of the country, be aware that you might simply get bread with sliced tomatoes on top!</p>
<p class="indented">Sometimes garlic is a feature, often depending on the time of day you eat it. In Navarra at the olive oil mill of Hacienda Queiles in Tudela, I was given toasted country bread with a bowl of grated tomato with tender raw garlic shoots <em>(ajetes)</em> finely chopped and mixed in almost like a herb, which you spooned on top: wonderful.</p>
<p class="indented">Tomato bread is so simple that everything depends on the quality, ripeness and flavour of the tomatoes. Spain is endowed with exceptional tomatoes throughout most of the year, but in the Levante, the area of the east coast that stretches from Catalunya in the north down to Murcia, they specialise in a small, strong-skinned variety of ‘hanging tomato’, <em>tomaquet de penjar</em>, which is cultivated exclusively for the purpose of making tomato bread. The tomatoes are harvested just as they start to turn red, then are matured and ripened in a cool dark place such as an attic or cellar. Typically their stems are sewn in bunches on to knotted strings that are stretched from ceiling to floor, though the father of Leo Rivera, our head chef, has developed a horizontal system for the tomatoes he grows in the family allotment, in which he twists the whole plants around wires stretched across his roof space.</p>
<p class="indented"><em>Tomaquets de penjar</em> contain more bright red juice and less flesh than other varieties, and thanks to their strong skin they won’t fall apart when you press them on to your slice of bread or toast. They paint the bread a beautiful colour, their flavour is rich and deeply aromatic, and they are so highly regarded that people will pay easily three or four times more than for other varieties in the Catalan markets.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_73"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg073.jpg"/></div>
<p class="indented"><a id="pg_74"/>Traditionally, for <em>pan con tomate</em> people used bread that was a day or two old, which would come to life with the juice of the tomato. My favourite is <em>pan de coca</em> (flatbread, see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_70">here</a>) or alternatively <em>pan de pay</em><em>é</em><em>s</em> (country loaf); or a slice of sourdough. In the Basque country they often use a baguette, though this wouldn’t be my first choice, as once rubbed with tomato the soft texture can become too pasty. Look for bread with a good crust and quite an open airy texture – not dense and solid – that will crisp up nicely if you are toasting it. Industrial sliced bread won’t do, as it will just become a mush.</p>
<p class="indented">You also need good olive oil, something fruity but not overpowering, such as <em>Arbequina</em>, which will complement the sweetness of the tomato. Use as much as you like, but remember that you might end up with oil running down your arm as you eat.</p>
<p class="indented">Inevitably, there is always an argument over which of the few ingredients should go on to the bread or toast first. At home the way we do it is to toast a pile of good bread, then put out the halved tomatoes, cut cloves of garlic (for those that want them), a bottle of good extra virgin olive oil and some sea salt, and let everyone help themselves. If you are happy using your fingers this is really the best way, however messy.</p>
<p class="indented">If you are using garlic I would say only do so if the bread is toasted, and then rub it on <em>before</em> the tomato, as the roughness of the toast’s surface gives you something to grate the cloves against, and it will embed itself better if the bread is not already soaked in tomato. Next I would squeeze the juice into the toast until it is coloured bright red and all that is left of the tomatoes is their skin. Ideally, you will have more juice than flesh on the toast, so it looks as if it has been painted red.</p>
<p class="indented">Some say salt should come next, then oil, as this helps the salt to impregnate the bread, but I like to drizzle on the oil first and rub it in, then scatter on sea salt, as I love the crunch it gives.</p>
<p class="indented">Eat straight away, neat, or with whatever topping you like, from slices of cured ham or sausage to anchovies, or <em>Manchego</em> cheese. Freshly cooked kippers are good too.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec21">Alubias al horno en salsa de tomate</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Homemade baked beans in spicy tomato sauce</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is baked beans taken to a whole new, spicy level, which we serve for breakfast at our London Bridge restaurant, using small white <em>arrocina</em> beans – a Spanish twist on a British tradition. We make the <em>brava</em> sauce with a little more sugar than when serving it in the traditional way with potatoes, which makes it a bit more syrupy when it reduces down during cooking. The quantity of liquid might seem a lot when the dish goes into the oven, but I promise you this works – we cook these beans regularly at home and they are a big favourite.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4–6</p>
<p class="ingredients">500g <strong><em>arrocina</em></strong> beans</p>
<p class="ingredients"><strong><em>salsa brava</em></strong> sauce (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_295">here</a>), made with 2 tablespoons of demerara sugar, rather than just a pinch</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 rice <strong><em>morcilla de Burgos</em></strong> (optional, see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_76">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon olive oil</p>
<p class="method">Soak the <em>arrocina</em> beans in cold water overnight.</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas 4.</p>
<p class="method">Drain the beans, put into an ovenproof dish and cover with 2 litres of fresh cold water. Stir in the <em>brava</em> sauce and put into the preheated oven, without a lid, for 3 hours, until the beans are tender and the liquid is syrupy and has reduced down to just about a centimetre above the beans.</p>
<p class="method">Slice the <em>morcilla</em>, if using, into 1 cm rounds, then heat the olive oil in a small frying pan and brown each slice on both sides. Serve on top of the beans.</p>
<div class="diamond-image"><a id="pg_76"/><img alt="image" class="width50" src="../images/pg076.jpg"/></div>
<p class="square-subhead">‘varied in shape, flavour and texture’</p>
<p class="flush_left">The black puddings of Spain are very varied in shape, flavour and texture. Like <em>chorizo</em>, they can be small like a regular sausage, fatter and more salami-shaped, or hooped, and they might be poached before being sold, or hung up to cure, and sometimes even smoked. Some are best suited to grilling or frying; some are texturally better for adding to a one-pot dish, usually with beans, or the cooked <em>morcilla</em> might be taken out of its casing and eaten as a spread.</p>
<p class="indented">The traditional way of making the sausage is to heat the pig’s blood in a big cauldron, then mix in fat, salt and spices, plus any other recipe ingredients, before stuffing into natural casings. Many <em>morcilla</em>s will have around 50 per cent pork meat added as well as fat, and across the regions you find a vast variety of added flavours and different textures. In Galicia, there are some curious <em>morcillas</em> made with dried fruits such as minced figs, walnuts and breadcrumbs; or in the Canaries sweet potato, currants, thyme, almonds, bread and sugar might be added. In the Basque country leeks, pumpkin and rice are used (here they even have a <em>morcilla</em> called <em>mondejos</em>, made from sheep’s blood), and in Aragón, herbs, spices and nuts. The special sausages made in this region for the feast of San Antón (Saint Anthony, hermit and patron saint of animals) on 17 January are flavoured with cinnamon, ground aniseed, walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts, pine nuts and rice.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">How to choose <strong><em>morcilla</em></strong></h4>
<p class="flush_left">Pick the <em>morcilla</em> best suited to the way you want to eat it. Smaller, softer <em>morcillas</em> that have thinner casings and look like normal sausages (about 15cm long and 2.5cm in diameter) have usually been poached before you buy them, and will just need to be finished by grilling, frying or breaking up to make a soft mince or <em>migas</em> (crumbs) that can be added to dishes.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">I think the ideal breakfast <em>morcilla</em> is the fat sausage from Burgos, as it contains rice, which makes it quite dense, and as it is always poached before being sold it is very easy to slice, then fry or grill in fat rounds that hold together. Also, it is not as strongly flavoured as those from some other regions, but just lightly spiced with cumin or nutmeg.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">Other <em>morcillas,</em> especially those which contain onion, and often also pine nuts and cinnamon, are quite soft, and should not be sliced before cooking, but grilled whole, or added at the end of a long-cooked dish, typically of beans, otherwise they will disintegrate. This softer style is also ideal for <em>migas</em>.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">Firmer ones, such as those from Asturias in the north, are often smoked after curing and therefore a fair bit drier, almost wrinkled <a id="pg_78"/>and leathery-looking (often they are thin and hooped), so they need more rehydration in the cooking process. These are ideal for long, slow-cooked dishes, as they will happily plump up and hold their shape while they are simmering in the pot for a couple of hours. They impart a deep smoky flavour to the dish, and because they stay intact, they can be neatly sliced at the end of the cooking.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_77"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg077.jpg"/></div>
<p class="flush_left1">Some <em>morcillas</em>, such as those made with the meat, fat and blood from <em>Ibérico</em> pigs (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_168">here</a>) are not poached, but are cured for around 50 days and can be eaten sliced, like any other cured sausage. Their texture can be quite coarse and they look very dark but with redder <em>pimentón</em>-coloured chunks. They are high in fat and I feel they are almost too rich for adding to one-pot dishes, but they are great grilled.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec22"><a id="pg_79"/>Migas de la casa</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Breadcrumbs with <em>chorizo</em>, <em>panceta</em> and black pudding</p>
<p class="flush_left"><em>Migas</em> (breadcrumbs) are an old country breakfast favourite to eat with good bacon (<em>baicon</em>), or <em>chorizo</em> and eggs; or, in the south of Spain, topped with a tin of good sardines, or roasted peppers. Traditionally, they were an essential shepherd’s sustenance, eaten in the field in early morning by the campfire: pieces of old, dry bread, fried in a little fat, with maybe some garlic, paprika or herbs added, if they were available. When the men were lucky there might have been some cured ham or sausage to eat with them.</p>
<p class="indented">Friends at one of our olive oil suppliers, Olivar de la Luna, told us about a local rhyme that would be sung by olive harvesters, frying up <em>migas</em> in the groves:</p>
<p class="hang-indented">Sartenes tostando migas<br/>están repicando al alba<br/>sartenes tostando migas<br/>anuncian la madrugada . . .</p>
<p class="flush_left1">which translates as:</p>
<p class="hang-indented1">Frying pans toasting crumbs<br/>pealing out at dawn<br/>frying pans toasting crumbs<br/>herald in the morn . . .</p>
<p class="indented">One of our former head chefs, Esperanza Añonuevo Heys, worked with me on this recipe, which is more luxurious than the old shepherds’ or oil harvesters’ fare, incorporating <em>chorizo</em>, <em>panceta</em> and <em>morcilla</em>. I would use a <em>morcilla</em> from Burgos, which is milder than some, and if you can find <em>panceta ibérica</em> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_394">here</a>), so much the better.</p>
<p class="indented">If you like, you can leave all the ingredients to soak in a bowl overnight in the fridge – if you do this, you will need to add a little extra stock.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g stale country-style bread</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons sherry or dry white vermouth</p>
<p class="ingredients">130ml chicken stock</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g cooking <strong><em>chorizo</em></strong></p>
<p class="ingredients">1 small soft onion <strong><em>morcilla</em></strong> (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_76">here</a>), around 70g</p>
<p class="ingredients">50g <strong><em>panceta</em></strong>, finely diced</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a green pepper, finely diced</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons olive oil, plus extra for frying the eggs</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 eggs</p>
<p class="method">If you wish, cut the crusts from the bread then put it into a food processor and pulse a few times to make the breadcrumbs. They should be medium to fine, and don’t need to be completely regular.</p>
<p class="method">Put the crumbs into a large bowl and sprinkle them with the sherry or vermouth along with the chicken stock.</p>
<p class="method">Skin the <em>chorizo</em> and <em>morcilla</em>, break them up into very small pieces and add to the bowl, along with the <em>panceta</em> and green pepper. Season and mix together lightly. Cover the bowl and leave for a minimum of an hour. The mixture should feel damp and sticky to the touch.</p>
<p class="method">Heat the oil in a wide, deep frying pan over a low to medium heat, then add the breadcrumb mixture and turn about in the oil. Cook for a few minutes, then stir and turn the mixture again. Continue in this way for about 10 minutes, until warmed through and lightly golden – the crumbs should not be crisp, but more the consistency of a cooked grain, such as bulgar wheat.</p>
<p class="method">Meanwhile, heat a little more oil in a separate pan and fry the eggs, making sure you keep the yolks soft. Serve some <em>migas</em> on each of 4 plates and top each with a fried egg.</p>

<p class="flush_left">I first met Pepe Buitrago, an abstract installation and holographic artist, and his partner, Mercedes Laso, a puppet-maker, at an art exhibition in London when I had just started Brindisa and they were living in the capital for a few years before returning to Madrid. Pepe was establishing a market for his art, and Mercedes was selling her puppets in small art outlets. Beyond their crafts, they are great intellectuals who love music and food, and gathering friends around them to cook, eat, drink and discuss the world.</p>
<p class="indented">One of the first words I learned in Spanish literature was <em>tertulia</em>, which refers to a small gathering of academics, artists, writers and historians who get together regularly to share thoughts and enrich the mind on a range of scholarly topics and ideas over an afternoon or evening, and often into the small hours – something akin to the Bloomsbury set in London in the early twentieth century. Across Spain there is a network of <em>tertulias</em>, which hold this old tradition as something precious and a little removed from modern life, in which there is so rarely time to sit and ruminate on philosophical or literary matters.</p>
<p class="indented">Pepe and Mercedes are part of a <em>tertulia</em> circle who are also great cooks – including Raul Domingo, his wife Carmen Dalmau (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_111">here</a>), and Margarita and Asunción Almela Boix, jolly, funny, anarchistic and academic sisters (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_98">here</a>) in their sixties who have very strong opinions on food. Consequently, they often hold their <em>tertulias</em> in the bars and restaurants of different Castilian towns, so that good cooking, good drink and good thoughts are always on the agenda.</p>
<p class="indented">From the start Pepe and Mercedes were so interested in my fledgling plan to bring Spanish foods to the British table that we connected immediately, and Mercedes put her puppet-making skills to amazing use for me, making the strings for hundreds of dried peppers and <em>farcellets</em> (see <a href="chapter_001.html#pg14a">here</a>). One of our earliest Brindisa success stories, these were made up of dried <em>ñora</em> and <em>guindilla</em> peppers, alternated with little parcels of dried thyme and savory wrapped up in bay leaves, which provided the perfect rustic mix of flavourings for casseroles.</p>
<p class="indented">Both Castilians (Pepe is originally from Tomelloso, La Mancha, and Mercedes from Salamanca city), they have been invaluable in teaching me about the mood and food of central Spain. They <a id="pg_81"/>showed me how to make my first <em>cocido madrileño</em> (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_446">here</a>) for a big tableful of family and friends at my parents’ house in Hampshire, and from them I first learned about the likes of <em>caldereta</em>: shepherd’s lamb stew (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_435">here</a>), <em>morteruelo</em>, a spiced game and meat pâté, and <em>zarajos</em>. A favourite in the villages of La Mancha, these are milk-fed lamb intestines, stretched and twisted by hand in tidy loops over small vine twigs, knotted, roasted in a hot oven for about an hour, then split into two and grilled just before serving, still on their twigs, so you eat them like kebabs on skewers. They look beautiful to the eye, but are quite a heady and aggressive experience for the nose and palate: not for the faint-hearted.</p>
<p class="indented">In the late eighties when Pepe and Mercedes were travelling between Spain and London, they would bring me produce such as <em>tortas cenceñas</em> for serving in the herb-scented stock of <em>gazpachos manchegos</em> (game stew, <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_456">here</a>). Each giant unleavened biscuit, similar to a water biscuit, came in individual bright, retro-style wrapping, featuring Don Quixote characters.</p>
<p class="indented">Time spent with Pepe and Mercedes is always uplifting and no trip to Madrid is complete without a visit to them at their apartment in the area that used to be the medieval city, in a street with the wonderful name of Mediodía Grande, ‘the big midday’. The apartment was converted from shops, and Pepe has created a series of simple living spaces in which to celebrate his renowned art and holography, food, family and cooking, which all seem to happily co-exist. I remember one Christmas time, when Pepe’s sons from his first marriage visited, he built a huge nativity set for them, with lights and music, half the size of a dining room, but it was so typical of him that in addition to the scene around the manger he had created streams and fields, with models of villagers harvesting, plucking chickens and baking bread.</p>
<p class="indented">Pepe also gave me his recipe for a lemon salad ‘hangover’ breakfast: a Manchegan cleansing recipe made by villagers in Castilla La Mancha after a big meat and red wine fest – when actually it is usually the quantity of meat, rather than alcohol, that is consumed in excess. The idea is that the salad cleans the system and allows everybody to embark on more of the same by midday! In fact, it is absolutely delicious, and so well worthy of its inclusion in this chapter, hangover or no hangover.</p>
<p class="center_head">ENSALADA DE LIMÓN</p>
<p class="flush_left">Finely (and quietly if necessary!) chop 1 mild onion, spring onion or shallot with 2 garlic shoots, then peel a lemon and carefully squeeze as much juice as you can over the top without destroying the segments of flesh (don’t throw the lemon away). Leave for 10 minutes to mellow the flavours. Chop the pieces of the lemon flesh left after squeezing and add to the mixture. Season and add 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Mix together and finally add 2 tablespoons of cold water. Mix again, serve with good bread and recover.</p>
