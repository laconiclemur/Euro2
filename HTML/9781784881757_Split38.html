<p class="tx2"><b>This perfectly simple recipe is from Graziella, the chef from La Mandriola, a stunning <i>agriturismo</i> on top of a hill near Volterra. We stayed here and Graziella showed us how she made her soft-set plum jam, which is rather like a compote. It is ideal for pouring over soft ricotta and topping with chopped walnuts for breakfast. Alternatively, stir it into yoghurt or enjoy it on toast. We often make half this amount and keep it in the fridge for up to a month. It doesn’t have a high sugar content so cannot be guaranteed to last out of the fridge, unless the jars are sterilised. If you make this large batch and wish to keep it for longer, follow the instructions for preserving a low-sugar recipe in jars on <a href="9781784881757_Split31.html#page_50">how to store low-sugar preserves</a>.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">MAKES APPROX. 2 KG (4 LB 6 OZ)</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>3 kg (6 lb 6 oz) ripe plums, washed, cut in half and stoned</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>900 g (2 lb/scant 4 cups) caster (superfine) sugar</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Put the plums in a large heavy-based saucepan with the sugar and bring to the boil over a gentle heat. Let the jam bubble away, stirring frequently, until the fruit is soft. This will take between 30 minutes and 1 hour, depending on the ripeness of the fruit. Remove from the heat.</p>
<p class="tx">The jam can now be puréed with a stick blender for a smooth finish or left with the softened plums still intact for a little texture. Pour into clean jars while hot and screw on clean lids. Allow to cool and store in the fridge for up to 1 month.</p>
