<p class="summary">Spain is a leading producer and exporter of olives, mostly green olives. On the tree, olives are first yellowish, then pale green, and they gradually turn from pink to purple to black as they ripen. Spaniards prefer them when they are still green and their oils have not fully developed. Following the Sevillian style of processing, they are washed, soaked in an alkaline solution for about five to seven hours to remove their bitterness, and then washed again and left to ferment in brine. Every region has its own traditional way of flavoring its olives, with garlic and herbs such as bay leaves, thyme, oregano, and/or fennel. In Andalusia, they add a little vinegar. The production of mechanically pitted olives stuffed with anchovies, almonds, or roasted red pepper and canned or jarred is a major industry.</p>
<p class="summary">The Manzanilla olives from Seville and southwest Spain are the most popular green table olives. Large and oval, pale green with tiny white dots, they are aromatic and mildly bitter. A whole family of olives—the black Cacereña, the green and black Carrasqueña, the Aloreña, the Campo Real, the Morona—is descended from the Manzanilla, either through adaptation to different environments or through grafting. Other popular green olives are the Gordal Sevillana, as big as a quail egg, fleshy, and sweet, and the fruity and aromatic Hojiblanca of Córdoba. The small, very tasty, violet-green Arbequina is a specialty of Catalonia. Among the less common olives are the green Cornicabra of La Mancha; the almost black, oily, strong-tasting, and bitter Empeltre from Aragon; the sweet, oily Cuquillo of Valencia; the aromatic Picual of Jaén; and the Verdial of Huelva, which is darkened by oxidation.</p>
