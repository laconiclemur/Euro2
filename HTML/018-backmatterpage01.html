<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Buying, Storing, and Using Balsamic Vinegar</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Buying balsamic vinegar poses all the hazards of Russian roulette. Grab the first thing you find on the market shelf and you might end up with a mellow, rich example or a vinegar so raw and poorly balanced that it will turn you off to any future encounters. Also, since price is no indicator of quality (and in the United States ranges from $3 to well over $100 for a small bottle), it is important to know what you are buying.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">This vinegar originated in Emilia-Romagna’s provinces of Modena and Reggio nearly a thousand years ago. Today, it not only continues to be a vital part of the culture there, but no other area has succeeded in reproducing high-quality balsamics. Exported balsamic vinegars fall into three categories: vinegars made in the provinces of Modena and Reggio by the traditional artisan method and tested by the balsamic consortiums of Modena and Reggio; commercially produced vinegars from Modena and Reggio; and imitations produced outside the provinces of Modena and Reggio.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">The Imitations:</span> Balsamic vinegar production has become highly profitable. Imitations from as far away as Naples are now common, as well as vinegar shipped in bulk from Italy and bottled in the United States. These vinegars rarely equal Modena and Reggio’s products. (There is a rumor at the time of this writing of American-made balsamic vinegars, too.) Each balsamic vinegar bottled in Italy bears a code indicating its place of origin. Check labels for API MO, indicating Modena, or API RE for Reggio.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Artisan-Made Balsamic Vinegar of Modena and Reggio:</span> Members of Modena’s consortium of producers of traditional balsamic vinegar are combating the Russian roulette aspect of buying <a id="page468"/>balsamics by instituting a DOC, or domain of origin control, for Modenese vinegars.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="Images/468.jpg"/></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">A vinegar bearing the Modena consortium seal and the words <span class="italic">Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Modena</span> must be made by the traditional artisanal method, have been aged for a minimum of 12 years, and have been produced within the confines of Modena province. It cannot contain any wine vinegar or caramel.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">No vinegar receives that seal until a critical evaluation and tasting is completed by five experts. The accepted balsamic is bottled by the consortium. Once a vinegar producer delivers his barrel of balsamic to the consortium for evaluation, he never touches it again, until it is either sealed in bottles or the rejected barrel is returned to him.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Approved vinegars are identified by a distinctive bottle. Although molded in one piece, it resembles a glass globe set in a rectangular stand.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Reggio’s own <span class="italic">balsamico</span> consortium has instituted similar restrictions on their vinegars. Look for a curvaceous vase-shaped bottle with a round seal stating “Consortium of Producers of Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Reggio Emilia.” They offer three different quality levels indicated by colored labels, with gold being the highest designation, silver the next, and then red.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">There is a third consortium based in Spilamberto, not far from the city of Modena. This group, Consorteria dell’Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale, is considered the spiritual mother of Modena’s and Reggio’s organizations and inspired their formations. Although the Spilamberto group had no commercial function, it trains and qualifies the master tasters that evaluate Modena’s and Reggio’s consortium vinegars. The Spilamberto consorteria came together with the goal of revitalizing balsamic traditions and helping families reestablish vinegar attics destroyed during World War II. Membership is open to all balsamic vinegar makers (whether they sell their vinegars or make them only for personal pleasure) and now numbers over 1,900 members. Throughout the year, members submit their vinegars for evaluation, hoping that their balsamic will be the winner of Spilamberto’s coveted Palio di San Giovanni award for the best vinegar of the year, presented on San Giovanni’s Day, June 24.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Whether from Modena or Reggio, these vinegars are the Rolls-Royces of balsamics. The best examples are luscious and complex. They should have a luster or glow and be sable brown or brown-black in color. When the bottle is tipped, the vinegar should look viscous and coat the glass.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">To me, the taste of a good artisan-made balsamic is that of a fine liqueur rather than anything you would put on a salad. It resembles a mixture of old port and a full-flavored brown <a id="page469"/>sauce, backed by a little acid. A good one changes on the palate from a dark noncloying sweetness with a suggestion of caramel and wood to a subtle backtaste of acid accenting the vinegar’s complex character.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Although these vinegars are expensive (from $40 to over $100 a bottle), they will last a long time if used as they are in Reggio and Modena. They taste best sipped as liqueurs or drizzled in small quantities over finished dishes. Cooking would diminish this vinegar’s special quality. Use only a small spoonful for seasoning simple pastas and risotti, grilled or roasted meats, seafood, poultry, vegetables, fritters and frittatas, or fresh berries, melons, pears, peaches or nectarines.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Commercial Balsamic Vinegar from Modena and Reggio:</span> These are the vinegars most readily available in the United States and the ones used for testing recipes in this book. In Italian they are called <span class="italic">industriale</span>. They are acidic and straightforward, begging to be blended <span class="italic">into</span> dishes.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Commercial balsamics are made in a variety of ways. The most desirable are a blend of high-quality wine vinegar, cooked-down grape must, young balsamic vinegar, and possibly some caramel. Aging in balsamic barrels is favored. The least desirable combine raw-tasting wine vinegar with caramel and herbs, with no balsamic vinegar or cooked must at all.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">At their best they are less complex renditions of artisan-made vinegar, with finely balanced sweetness and acidity melded together as a unified whole. Poor examples seem to break apart on the palate, first tasting sweet and then, after a pause, hitting hard with raw acidity. A well-made commercial balsamic has sweetness accentuated by tartness and a deep brown taste. Add these to sauces, soups, stews, salads and marinades. Like their older counterparts, these vinegars are fine drizzled over almost anything deep-fried, as well as summer fruits.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Since there is such a difference from brand to brand, suggesting a specific commercial vinegar is important to the success of the recipes in this book. Fini is a sound example, available by mail order and in shops throughout the country. (Fini was purchased by a large American food company in 1990. It is too soon to tell if the quality of the vinegar will be diminished by the change in management.) Other brands of good quality are Giuseppe Giusti, Elena Monari Federzoni, Cavalli, or Cattani.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Balsamic vinegar appears in recipes from antipasto to dessert (see Index for specific dishes).

<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">How Balsamic Vinegar Is Made</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">If you could climb up into the attics of the old palazzos and farmhouses in Modena and Reggio provinces, you would discover rows of wooden barrels filled with a vinegar produced nowhere else in the world. Imitations are attempted outside the area, but none duplicate true balsamic’s unique qualities. Some call it a nectar, others a condiment. For nearly 1,000 years it was so precious that Europe’s royalty tasted it before commoners outside Emilia even knew it existed. Until about 25 years ago, old, artisan-made balsamics were never sold, they were shared as gifts to visiting dignitaries and treasured friends and relatives. To this day well-born brides of Modena and Reggio accept nothing less than a tiny cask as their dowry. That cask could well hold a balsamic aged over a century and resounding with such deep, rich flavor that it is reserved for sipping as a liqueur on special occasions.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">This vinegar was first created about 1,000 years ago in the provinces of Modena and Reggio. Balsamic tastes like no other vinegar. Its flavor is sweet, tart, layered with woods and caramel undertones. The artisanal process that produces it is unique in all Italy, and possibly in the world.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Every autumn in Modena and Reggio provinces, the Trebbiano grape is harvested at the height of its sweetness. Its sugars are intensified by first setting out closed boxes of the fruit on the sunny porches of homes for several days. Then the freshly pressed juice, or “must,” is simmered down to a sweet concentrate. (Trebbiano grapes are favored but the law allows for other regional varieties—Lambrusco, Occhio di Gatto (“cat’s eye”), Berzemino, and Spergola—to balance the vinegar’s character where necessary.) During 24 or more hours of cooking, the grape’s sugar lightly caramelizes, creating one of the many flavor elements that give balsamic vinegar its unique taste. Unlike wine vinegar, which is made by converting alcohol to acid, balsamic is produced by converting sugar to acid.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The cooled, settled liquid is drawn off and mellowed in rows of progressively smaller wooden barrels set out in airy, sun-filled attics (called <span class="italic">acetaia</span>, or vinegar attic). Strong debate wages over whether or not the barrels should contain a “mother,” the gelatinous bacterial substance that attacks alcohol or sugars and oxidizes them to form acetic acid or vinegar. Some makers throw it away as it forms, claiming it harms the balsamic, while others nurture the “mother” with great care. Those who discard the “mother” combine the cooked must with balsamic vinegar to create the fermentation necessary to turn the must into <span class="italic">balsamico</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Yet another factor is the wood itself. A different wood (chestnut, oak, cherry, mulberry, or ash) might form each cask, imparting its own particular color and flavor to the balsamic. Every barrel has holes in its top, encouraging evaporation and concentration of flavors, an important dimension of the vinegar’s complex character. Modena’s and Reggio’s climate of steamy hot summers and icy winters gives the vinegar its needed rhythm of aging: fermentation and later evaporation in the heat, with long rests in the cold.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">As vinegar is taken from the smallest or end barrel (about once a year), the barrel is refilled from the next larger one. Each barrel is topped off from the next larger one until the biggest is reached. That is replenished with the cooked must.</p>
<a id="page471"/>

<p class="caption" style="text-indent:0%;">Consorzio Produttori di Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Modena</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">There is no set number of barrels, but according to balsamic vinegar maker and research scientist Dr. Claudio Biancardi, there must be a minimum of three. The first is where the fermentation begins converting the balsamic’s sugars to acid. In the second barrel, enzymes work on the developing vinegar, giving it many nuances of aroma, taste and color. Dr. Biancardi says the slower the enzymes work, the more complex the vinegar. He explains that in the third barrel the enzyme action continues, but at an even slower rate, along with evaporation and concentration of flavors.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Vinegar from the end of a row of casks is often transferred to tiny barrels or open jugs for further maturing. There the <span class="italic">balsamico</span> could rest for several generations, becoming viscous, intensely aromatic, sweet and silky, as its acidity is muted with each passing decade. This is the stuff of dowries and coveted gifts, passed from one generation to the next. In Modena it is said, “One generation makes balsamic for the next.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Variables are infinite in this system; the result is that no two balsamic vinegars are alike. Each maker might use a different combination of woods. (Old barrels, seasoned by decades or even centuries of use, are treasured. When they deteriorate, new casks are built around them, or chunks of their woods are added to other barrels, guaranteeing the vinegar’s constant contact with the aged wood.) No two sets of barrels produce the same vinegar.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I experienced a vivid example of this when Modenese producer Giuseppe Giusti invited me to taste old vinegars. He led me up into the rambling vinegar attics of his home. Countless rows of ancient barrels were everywhere, many first filled with vinegar by his family in the 16th century. Every Giusti since then has made balsamic vinegar.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">We settled in the largest attic, flooded with sun and banked with shelves of the smallest casks. With a long glass pipette he drew some liquid from a little cask at the end of a row of barrels and filled a goblet no bigger than a thimble. The vinegar looked brown, thick, and shiny. I sniffed a little hesitantly. No sharpness, only rich round smells. The taste swept me away—flavors of browned meats, old port, wood, herbs, and only enough acid to give depth. This could not be called vinegar; its deep resonance all but hummed.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Then Giusti dipped into a barrel from another row and filled a second glass. Startling. All I could think of was wild flowers and new hay. The vinegar was as thick and aromatic as the first, but it tasted young and fresh, with all the delicacy of a spring meadow.</p>
<a id="page472"/>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Giusti explained that both vinegars had been started at the same time by his great-grandfather, 120 years before. Their taste difference came from the barrels, some of which dated back two centuries.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">In the Beginning</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Vinegar makers speculate over how the multiple barrel system and its variety of woods came into being. One theory is that it started with an old practice of mellowing vinegars for different uses in barrels of different woods. Vinegar for pickling or flavoring meats was often aged in oak. Vinegar for preserving fruits was stored in cherry barrels, while vinegars for pickling the nut harvest or saucing game frequently matured in chestnut.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Ordinary vinegar had been a favorite preservative and seasoning of Mediterranean peoples since before Christ. According to balsamic expert Renato Bergonzini, during the Middle Ages, vinegar making in some parts of of Italy was a coveted process performed by guilds whose members swore oaths of secrecy. In modern Italian, <span class="italic">tenere il segreto dell’aceto</span> (“to keep the secret of vinegar”) means tenaciously holding to a confidence.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">In Modena and Reggio, however, anyone with land and vines could have made balsamic vinegar. It might have begun when boiled-down grape juice (known as <span class="italic">saba</span> or <span class="italic">sapa</span> and popular as a sweetener since Roman times; find its recipe in Pastas) was stored in a barrel that had held wine or guild-made vinegar. The wine or vinegar’s residue encouraged acetic acid to develop, yielding a sweet/tart vinegar.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Another approach was the ancient and common practice of tempering a very acid tasting vinegar with sweet grape syrup, which perhaps led to a barrel of the mixture being forgotten and aging long enough to make a new kind of vinegar. For centuries families produced different-style balsamics, using many variations on these methods. Since 1878 the multiple-barrel technique using only boiled-down grape must has been favored, and in the late 1970s it became the legal definition of Modena’s and Reggio’s “traditional” artisan-made balsamic vinegar <span class="italic">(Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Modena)</span>.</p>
<div class="box"><hr/>
<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">First a Medicine, Then a Seasoning</span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Balsamic’s name derives from “balm,” or curative. Earliest records tell of the vinegar’s medicinal powers, not its culinary uses. Balsamic is credited with aiding everything from colds to heart conditions. During the plague of 1630, the Duke of Modena refused to leave his castle without an open jug of balsamic vinegar purifying the air in his carriage. Lucrezia Borgia, in one of Italy’s first product testimonials, declared it an invaluable balm for the discomforts of childbirth. Composer Gioacchino Antonio Rossini claimed it bolstered his spirits when life became oppressive. Many still believe small sips produce tranquility and restore failing health. And I know balsamic makers who always carry little flasks of it, diluting a few drops in water to soothe a sore throat, inhaling it to clear the head, or seasoning a veal chop with an eyedropperful at the dinner table. In rural parts of Modena and Reggio housewives still place an open cask of their homemade balsamic on a stand in the stair landing below the vinegar attic. Its aromas fill the house, freshening the air and hopefully warding off ills, while at the same time displaying the balsamic-making skills of the family matriarch.</p>

<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">Butter</span></p>
<p class="chapterHeadB" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Burro</span></span></p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Selecting and Storing Butter</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Use Grade AA unsalted butter—the sweeter the better. If available, you might want to try the new Plugra butter. Produced to equal European butters, it contains 10.88 percent less water than American butters. Because of its higher butter fat and lower water content, about 10 percent less is needed in sautéing and sauce making. In baking, do not reduce the quantity of butter called for, but Plugra makes slightly lighter pastries and fluffier buttercreams. It has good flavor.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Storing:</span> Since butter absorbs flavors, keep it well wrapped when storing it in the refrigerator. Check its package for an expiration date. Use up within several days of that date. Butter freezes well; seal it in a plastic bag and freeze up to 3 months.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">A New Way to Use Butter</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">In the past, Emilia-Romagna’s unsalted, often intensely sweet-tasting butter was second only to pork as the area’s cooking medium. Olive and seed oils tied for third place. For health reasons, today many regional cooks reserve butter for where its flavor really counts.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Like cooks in Emilia-Romagna, I too have decreased the quantity of butter in the recipes. Wherever possible, it is used sparingly as a flavoring agent rather than as the sole cooking medium. For instance, in a dish such as Tagliatelle with Prosciutto di Parma, which traditionally calls for large amounts of butter in the sauce, a reduction of tasty poultry stock finished with a little butter achieves a similar effect. Use the same trick when saucing any filled pastas calling for melted butter and cheese: Cut the butter back to 1 to 2 tablespoons, and blend it with 1 cup stock that has been boiled down to ½ cup.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Browning the meat patties of Artusi’s Delight in olive oil instead of butter sacrifices nothing in flavor and very little in authenticity. Finishing the pan sauce by swirling in a little butter at the last minute makes it taste much richer than it actually is. The natural sweetness of the unsalted butter balances beautifully with the tart tang of the balsamic vinegar. These techniques are repeated in many of the dishes. For instance, just 1 tablespoon of butter tossed with a pound of pasta and Winter Tomato Sauce brings out still more of the tomato’s natural sweetness.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Butter in Emilia-Romagna</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Until recently, butter was a status symbol in Emilia-Romagna, and in much of Italy. Until the late 1940s it was available only to those with enough land to graze cattle or with enough money to buy butter ready-made. Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese expert Dr. Mario Zannoni explains that during the 19th century many parts of Italy were fat-poor, lacking any form of the nutrient.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Emilia-Romagna’s rich grazing land set it apart from much of Italy. Its wealthy citizens fared better than many of their counterparts in other areas. Historic recipes of Emilia-Romagna’s affluent call for butter to be lavished over roasts of lean game. Pounds of it were used in pasta fillings during the Renaissance. Sixteenth-and 17th-century vegetable dishes often featured broccoli, fennel, cauliflower, or spinach simmered in butter the way we boil vegetables in water today.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Butter was so dear to the region’s peasants and artisans, on the other hand, that it was actually a form of payment for some. To this day, part of the wage paid to a Parmigiano-Reggiano cheesemaker is all the butter and ricotta he can use and sell. (Both are by-products of the cheese’s production.)</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">If you drive along the country roads of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese country, look for signs—often delightful three-dimensional ones—depicting whole Parmesan cheeses, marking the <span class="italic">caseficio</span>, or cheesemaking dairy. Tacked underneath will be notices of butter for sale. Local bread, some of that butter, and a wedge of Parmigiano-Reggiano make a fine picnic.</p>

<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Buying, Using, and Storing Coppa</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">At this time, Italian coppa is not exported to the United States. But fine coppe are produced here—so good, in fact, that I often prefer them to domestic prosciutti. In seeking them out, look for a solid piece of meat marbled with a moderate amount of fat. The meat should be rosy, never dark brown, never blackish, and never dried out.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Often shops carry pieces of identical-looking meat, one labeled <span class="italic">coppa</span> and the other called <span class="italic">capocollo</span>. The capocollo’s seasoning often includes fennel and hot pepper. Domestic coppa’s flavorings usually are similar to the milder seasonings of Emilia-Romagna: a mixture of salt, pepper, and perhaps a mild spice like clove, cinnamon or nutmeg.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Always taste before buying. Look for a meaty flavor with no one spice standing out and only a quiet backdrop of salt. There should be a pleasingly complex aftertaste with no suggestion of rancidity. The texture is compact, but not dry or stringy. Well-aged coppa feels supple on the tongue. Some brands to seek out are Rapelli and Volpi.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Coppa is sliced a bit thicker than prosciutto. It is excellent on antipasto platters (use ¼ to ½ ounce per person). Use it in cooking when you cannot get a high-quality prosciutto.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Storing:</span> Sliced coppa will keep, well sealed, in the refrigerator for about 4 days. A whole piece, unwrapped, will keep under refrigeration about 2 weeks. If it dries out too much, wrap it in a clean dish towel that has been dampened with white wine and store it in the refrigerator about 24 hours. Slice off the dry end piece before using.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Coppa in Italy</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Coppa is a solid mass of meat cut from the shoulder of the pig. After being seasoned, it is rolled into a compact cylinder, stuffed into a casing, and hung to cure in dry, airy rooms. Because of local dialects and changing names for cuts of meat, in some parts of Italy coppa is also called <span class="italic">capocollo</span> (“top of the neck”). It can be seasoned with hot pepper, or as in the Marche region of central Italy, with salt, sweet spices (nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, and the like), orange zest, almonds, and pine nuts. There is also a <span class="italic">coppa d’inverno</span> (“coppa of winter”), which resembles head cheese.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Emilia-Romagna’s rendition is a solid piece of pork shoulder cured with salt, pepper, and occasionally, subtle sweet spices. Its success depends on leisurely aging and the region’s own particularly flavorful pork.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Piacenza’s coppa is especially admired. It is aged at least 6 months, instead of the more usual 3 or 4. When dried out by summer heat, the coppa is remoistened by wrapping it in wine-soaked cloths; the meat takes on a lovely aroma from the wine. A fine coppa has some of prosciutto’s depth and sweetness but is more robust in character.</p>

<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Buying, Cooking, and Storing Cotechino</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Cotechino is a large, lightly cured pork sausage 2 inches in diameter in Italy (closer to 3 in the United States) and usually 10 to 12 inches long. Even though cotechino cures for several days, it is still a fresh sausage and is always cooked before serving.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Buy cotechino fresh from local specialty food stores, pork stores and Italian groceries.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Cotechino is cooked exactly the same way as zampone, and it can replace the harder-to-find zampone in many recipes.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">It is traditionally poached or steamed and eaten hot—often with mashed potatoes, lentils (a New Year’s tradition in much of Italy), braised beans, and/or spinach. Beef-Wrapped Sausage is a substantial winter specialty of both Modena and its neighbor Ferrara, in which partially cooked sausage is wrapped in a thin slice of beef and then braised with herbs, wine, and stock.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Less traditional but equally tempting is the holiday turkey created by my stepfather, Arthur Fulvini, a sausage-maker and native of Emilia’s northernmost province, Piacenza. After partially cooking a whole cotechino, he tucks it into the center of a stuffed turkey before roasting. Its fragrance permeates both stuffing and breast meat. Eaten together, cotechino and turkey breast are delectable.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Storing:</span> Store fresh cotechino, unwrapped, in the refrigerator up to 5 days.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Cotechino in Emilia-Romagna</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Like the more famous zampone, cotechino was first made in Modena. Both sausages are cooked and served hot, and both now share a similar coarsely ground and spiced filling. Zampone is the more regal, as its filling goes into a plump pig’s foot. Cotechino’s juicy and slightly chewy filling is merely stuffed into a large sausage casing.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The word <span class="italic">cotechino</span> derives from <span class="italic">cotenna</span>, or skin. In the past the skin made up two thirds of its filling, giving cotechino its poor-relation status as compared to the mostly meat-filled zampone. The rest of the filling was pork taken from many parts of the pig, spices, garlic, and, in Ferrara, generous amounts of red wine. Just over the Po River in Cremona, cotechino is still flavored with vanilla. Mantova adds a little sweet-tart <span class="italic">sapa</span>, the syrupy reduction of fresh-pressed wine grapes, while Romagna makes a bullet-shaped version with a turkey crop as casing.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">All this is evidence of cotechino’s origins: it was born of <span class="italic">la miseria</span>, or great poverty. After almost every bit of the pig was put by, given over to a landlord, or sold, the last scraps became cotechino. Occasionally even all the casings had been used, so a cleaned turkey crop would be substituted. Like France’s andouillette sausage of tripe and intestine, cotechino went beyond mere sustenance to become enticing eating.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Today cotechino is made with more luxurious ingredients. In the United States, lean pork shoulder, some skin, and spices constitute a cotechino.</p>

<p class="chapterHeadB" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Panna</span></span></p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Buying Cream</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Cream in Emilia-Romagna rarely exceeds 40 percent butterfat, which is the same as our heavy or heavy whipping cream (the label changes from one part of the United States to another). Beware of plain “whipping” cream, which can be so thin <a id="page476"/>that it is nearly impossible to whip. Also avoid ultrapasteurized or sterilized creams, or ones “stabilized” with additives. Flavor is the issue here. If you are going to cook with a liquid containing about 35 calories a tablespoon and 40 percent fat, it had better taste good.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Often co-op markets, health food stores, and specialty food shops carry a local dairy’s heavy cream that is simply pasteurized, not cooked and stabilized into tasteless oblivion. Please seek it out. Its sweet, luscious flavor will repay any effort.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Cooking with Cream</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Savory dishes laden with large amounts of cream are not Emilia-Romagna’s style. If cream is used at all, it is usually as an accent to a recipe, not as a main ingredient. Passionate traditionalists abhor the growing practice of saucing filled pastas like tortellini and tortelli with cream rather than small amounts of butter. In fact, cream is considered too sweet for these preparations. Desserts and cream are, however, another matter. Mousses, <span class="italic">semi-freddi</span>, and filled pastries, all made silken with whipped cream, are popular.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="Images/476.jpg"/></p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">Culatello</span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">One of Parma province’s most remarkable pork products is rarely exported beyond its borders. A small ham of complex taste and great finesse cut from the rear leg of the pig, culatello is successfully cured only in a small area of Parma’s plain, and to this day is still produced almost exclusively by local farmers and artisans.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">My introduction to culatello must have been orchestrated by the god of unforgettable dining experiences. It was my first trip to Parma, and the consortium overseeing the production of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese invited me to lunch at La Filoma. Under the guidance of its now-retired creators, Ursula and Sergio Ravazzoni, the restaurant had become a Parma institution—simple, gracious and comfortable. Long established in an old palace near the cathedral, Parma businessmen had been lunching there for decades.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Just beyond the entrance was the customary table artfully displaying vegetable antipasti, salami, Prosciutti di Parma, great mounds of fruits, platters of desserts, and a tumble of large pear-shaped pieces of what looked like oversize salami.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Sergio Ravazzoni asked me what I would like as an antipasto. Ah, did he by any chance have culatello? I’d heard it was very good.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">My companions laughed out loud. Signore Ravazzoni merely smiled knowingly. Certainly he had culatello. La Filoma, it turned out, was famous for its culatello. Indeed Signore Ravazzoni was one of Parma’s culatello connoisseurs, and had been buying his hams from the same family for more than 20 years. For me he would open a new one. (I later learned that in Parma a culatello is not cut, it is opened.)</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">A service table was set up next to ours, supplied with a cutting board and a long thin-bladed knife. Signore Ravazzoni placed on the board one of those pear-shaped “salami” from the entry display. It was about 18 inches long, rounded at the bottom, narrow toward the top, and about 7 inches wide at its broadest. Ravazzoni trimmed away a few remnants of the dusty white exterior. By now the whole room’s attention was focused on us. Then he cut into the culatello. The buzz of talk ceased.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The little ham exuded fragrances—grassy meadows, dried hay, that nutty quality of damp autumn leaves. I could almost see the aromas <a id="page477"/>floating around the room. I could hear the entire room inhaling and then, after a few beats, the prolonged sighs of contented exhaling. All around men were smiling at me. From a neighboring table one leaned over, gestured toward the culatello, and whispered, “You will like this—it’s very good here.” I felt as though I were being initiated into a secret society.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">A platter of four slices of russet-rose meat was set at my place. It was thinly cut, but not as thin as Prosciutto di Parma. Barely any outer fat rimmed the slices, and the lean meat was moderately marbled. Fragrances had intensified; grass and wild flowers, bubbling yeast, and black earth wet after a rain now sprung to mind.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The meat tasted moist, yet felt like silken leather on the tongue. It was sweet and salty at the same time, with an intensely meaty flavor reminiscent of old-time beef steaks that used to be aged for weeks. It was like a grand old Bordeaux translated into ham.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Culatello became obsession. I tasted it wherever I could find it—in the <span class="italic">trattorie</span> of towns no bigger than a large farmyard; in little bars with two or three tables for dining; at elegantly napped tables of smart restaurants; and from white paper packets bought at general stores and pork stores on the plain and in Parma city. At those shops it sold for almost double the price of Prosciutto di Parma (about $25 to $30 a pound). In some places people made their own; in others they bought from artisans and farmers. Culatello was always presented as an antipasto, accompanied only by Parma’s uncomplicated bread and occasionally curls of intensely sweet butter.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">My La Filoma experience was never repeated. None of the restaurants sliced culatello tableside, nor did life stop each time a platter of it was served. But no one was ever blasé about the ham. Almost every time I ate it, someone would point out, “You lose a whole prosciutto just to make a little culatello.” They always told of how rare and precious it was, how it could be made only in a small part of Parma’s plain. They would talk on about how its full, ripe character and its sweetness are unequaled even by the finest Prosciutto di Parma (this I could debate).</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Rarely was it ever compared to any other cured meat from anywhere else in Emilia-Romagna. When I once mentioned culatello in the same breath as ham from another region, I was treated with all the gentle and polite solicitude accorded to someone who has obviously lost her senses.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">No two culatelli are exactly alike, but for all their individuality, they fall into basic categories: <span class="italic">stagionata</span>, meaning fully seasoned, ripe, even strong, and aged up to 18 months; and <span class="italic">dolce</span>, literally translated as “sweet,” but also meaning mild, young, and fresh, usually about 12 months old. The former is favored by many Parmesans but can be an acquired taste for neophytes. I realized Ravazzoni’s wisdom in selecting a sweet ham of medium age for my initiation to culatello instead of an older, stronger example that might have put me off.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Culatello inspires strong opinions. Factory-made examples are generally held in low regard. Few Parmesans I know would eat them, and some speculated that they are all shipped out of the province. Several connoisseurs were adamant about culatello being eaten at the source, claiming that away from its home, it quickly loses its unique taste and aroma.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The fact is, little culatello ever leaves the area. Most of it is eaten in Parma province. Milan is the other main consumer, with some going to Rome. The Milanese connection is an old one, dating back to the 1400s, when the Pallavincos, the then ruling family of Busseto (a town in the ham’s zone), used gifts of culatello as a political pacifier in their dealings with the land-hungry Duke of Milan. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the Visconti ruled Milan and culatello territory. Noble tributes of the ham were constantly demanded for consumption at the Milanese court.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">How Culatello Is Made</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">As I learned more about culatello, each piece of information generated more questions: Why was this ham made only here? How did it evolve? How was it made? In an era of meat “cured” by 10-minute chemical injections, how had such artisanship survived?</p>
<a id="page478"/>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Luck and good friends brought me to Ettore Grisendi, whose official title then was public relations director of the consortium of producers of Prosciutto di Parma. He is an impassioned living encyclopedia of Parma’s gastronomy. Grisendi unraveled the mysteries of culatello in a day of intense exploration.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">We drove across the green Parma plain toward the Po River, where villages and farms seem to lean against the embankment. The air was still, soft, moist, smelling of hay and of the roses that dappled every garden. This was culatello country, the <span class="italic">basse Parmense</span>, or Parma lowlands, an area about 6 by 8 miles along the Po River, where embankments built up against flooding hold in morning fogs, increasing the humidity and warmth that led to culatello’s creation. In this microclimate airborne organisms combine with lightly salted meat, and at least a year of aging, to make a singular ham. Try curing the special cut outside this area and the result lacks culatello’s fragrance, savor, and moisture.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Grisendi emphasized that culatello evolved here from very practical needs. “Imagine you are a peasant. Your one pig has to feed the family for an entire year. The big, meaty rear leg is most prized. Try to cure a whole leg or prosciutto in the warm, moist climate of the plain as it’s done up in the mountains (where Prosciutto di Parma is made) with minimal salt, and you’d have spoiled meat. So either you use excessive salt (and we Parmesans don’t like that) or you divide the leg into smaller cuts that need only moderate salting to keep for a year or more. Now it is delicacy, but it came from <span class="italic">la miseria</span>, from being poor.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“But also from being picky,” I added.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Surely, but remember, if you need money, good culatello is easy to sell. Salt meat is not.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">My firsthand lesson in culatello making was given by Grisendi’s old friends, a mother-and-son team of artisans, who work in a garage-style extension to their small house. Grisendi acted as commentator.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">He showed how the leg is boned, defatted, and divided into three parts. The largest muscles (top and bottom round) become culatello (out of a 24-pound leg, there will be only a 6- to 7-pound culatello). The next largest portion, from right next to the round (on the other side of the leg bone), is the fiocchetto, which is cured like culatello. The triangular shank piece is boned, but with fat and skin left intact, salted, pressed in a wooden frame, hung, and cured. Although some call this <span class="italic">zampetto</span> or <span class="italic">jambetta</span> (meaning foot or shank), Grisendi explained that old-timers call it <span class="italic">il prete</span> (the priest), because it always went to the parish priest.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Once cut, culatello is rubbed with coarse sea salt twice during about 15 days of refrigeration.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“The goal is the same as for Prosciutto di Parma,” explained the son. “Use just enough salt to keep the meat from turning, yet not so much as to overwhelm its natural sweetness.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Once the salting period is completed, the meat is carefully nudged into a casing of semi-transparent pig bladder. Then the ham is “spanked” with a tack-studded wooden paddle to release any air bubbles under the casing.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">After a few days of chilling to dry out the moist casings, each ham is coaxed into a pear shape by being tied with wet hemp, which tightens as it dries. A spiderweb of intricate hemp lacing is worked at the meat’s base and woven into a fancy fishnet up the sides. It looks like fine crochet. Even after decades of experience, an artisan needs at least a quarter of an hour to weave the netting.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Now the culatelli are hung in a ground-level room with large open windows. Grisendi explained that because the air is humid both in summer and in winter, with few breezes, they dry very slowly and their centers stay moist and tender.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">After a year, a fine white mold covers most of the hams, which means they are ready for testing. Grisendi illustrated by poking the meat with a sharpened horse bone (the same test used for Parma ham), going in about an inch, withdrawing it, and sniffing the end. If there is an off aroma, the culatello has spoiled and is discarded. The hole is always sealed with fat. Air around a ham is desirable; air <span class="italic">in</span> a ham is disastrous. Depending upon demand, culatelli that are ready can be used immediately or aged another 2 to 6 months.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Before it is cut the culatello’s white surface is scrubbed off. Its exterior is remoistened during 7 or 8 days of soaking in red or white wine. The wine’s acidity cuts some of the salt and adds <a id="page479"/>another dimension to the meat’s taste.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">At this time, Parma’s culatello is not available in the United States. I would be dubious about any that are, since they would probably be factory-produced and possibly not of high quality. Also I tend to believe those purists who say that culatello loses its special character when taken away from its home. That character seems more fragile than those of Parma ham or Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Away from the humid air of the Po embankments, culatello’s unique qualities might suffer. Like certain wines, some foods should be left to flourish in their place of origin.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The best places to taste culatello are where restaurateurs do their own curing or obtain the ham from skilled farmers and artisans. These will not be tourist places. The territory encompasses the small townships of Zibello, Polesine Parmense, Busseto, and Soragna, and parts of San Secondo, Colorno, Roccabianca, and Sissa. Culatello on a menu in this area is worth sampling. In Parma city the restaurant scene changes with alarming speed these days, so check up-to-date sources before dining. A <span class="italic">salumeria</span> (where all-pork products are sold) is always a fine place to start. Try to begin tastings with <span class="italic">dolce</span>, moving on to <span class="italic">piu stagionata</span> (more ripened or aged) as your palate matures.</p>

<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Selecting American Flours for Italian Recipes</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Italy’s flour falls into two categories. <span class="italic">Grano tenero</span> is a tender wheat flour with a modest protein content, similar to our all-purpose flour. <span class="italic">Grano duro</span> is a flour of hard durum wheat with a high protein content. The degree of sifting, indicating how much of the bits of bran and grain has been eliminated, is marked on the package: “00” for the finest sift, “0” for a slightly coarser flour, “1” for yet coarser, and “2” for coarser still.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Gluten is the mixture of proteins in flour that makes doughs elastic when worked. How much gluten a flour contains is an important question when deciding which type to use for a recipe. The more gluten or protein in a flour, the more elastic the dough and the more water it will absorb. Higher-protein flours yield chewy and resilient pastas and breads. Grano duro (hard wheat) is extremely low in starch and high in gluten; this is the durum flour used for commercial pastas.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="Images/479.jpg"/></p>
<p class="caption" style="text-indent:0%;">The grain sifter, 17th century, by Giuseppe Maria Mitelli<br/> Casa di Risparmio, Bologna</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Flours very low in gluten and high in starch, like American cake flour, come from soft wheats. They make velvety cakes and tender pastries, but heavy breads and pastas.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Grano tenero, with its medium levels of starch and gluten, is used in most breads and fresh handmade pastas in Emilia-Romagna. The best American equivalent is an all-purpose unbleached flour with a protein content at the high end of the spectrum, between 11 and 14. Flours for pasta making are explored in detail in the Pastas chapter.</p>
<a id="page480"/>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">When making cakes and pastries, I imitate a grano tenero that is on the soft or starchy side by blending American all-purpose unbleached flour with cake flour. Recipes give specific proportions.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">To find out the protein content of a flour, check the bag for the nutritional information, which states the grams of protein per 4 ounces of flour. Cake flour is about 8, all-purpose (a blend of soft and hard wheats) ranges from 9 to 12, all-purpose unbleached goes from about 10 to 14, and bread flour is 13 to 15. These amounts vary slightly from brand to brand and from one part of the United States to another.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Using Organic Flour:</span> In attempting to reproduce the flour of Emilia-Romagna, there is more to consider than just gluten content. Many of the region’s flours have a vitality, a liveliness of taste and texture, born of different strains of wheat, soil, and perhaps even processing. In Emilia-Romagna it is said that this quality is a pale reflection of what existed 100 years ago.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Before the Industrial Revolution, with its bleaching, bromating, and roller-milling that stripped away every bit of bran and germ, the best of the region’s flour is said to have had enormous vigor, flavor, and bouquet. Today there is a budding Italian organic food movement that is trying to bring back the wholesome, flavorful wheats and the limited processing of long ago. In the United States, we can attempt to replicate that flour by using stone-ground organically raised wheat. In addition to retaining nutrients, the absence of excessive processing and additives allows the natural wheat flavors to emerge.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">In the interest of using ingredients everyone can find, I have tested my recipes with commercially processed flours. The dishes are even better, of course, if you use organic stone-ground grain. Just be sure to store these flours, well sealed, in the refrigerator or freezer, because the very factors that make them more nutritious and tasty also cause them to become stale quickly.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Measuring Flour:</span> One level measuring cup of flour can hold between 3½ and 6 ounces of flour, depending upon how it is filled. These variations in quantities make tremendous differences in pasta and can have disastrous results in baking. Imagine if the writer of your favorite cake recipe measured flour averaging 4 ounces per cup and you measure in a way that yields 6 ounces—a heavy cake is unavoidable.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Margins for error disappear when you use a scale: an ounce is an ounce no matter how you measure it. Although weighing ingredients may seem cumbersome, I find it much easier to set a bowl or paper bag on the scale and fill it with flour until the gauge reads the required weight than to measure out cup after cup.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">But if only measuring cups are available, you will get 4 ounces of flour, or enough for “one egg of my pasta,” in 1 cup of flour measured by lightly spooning the flour into the cup and leveling. Do not tap or tamp. Scooping into the canister with a measuring cup is less exact—usually 4 ounces equals a scant cup.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Wheat Flour in Emilia-Romagna</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Wheat was the glamour grain of the Mediterranean. Since the verge of prehistoric times battles have been fought, treaties made and broken, and piracy has flourished to control the production and transport of wheat from Constantinople to Gibraltar.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Wheat flour played a vital role in the survival of so many. Bread was indeed the staff of life for peasants and, during times of famine, for nobility as well. Wheat had remarkable qualities attributed to it. For instance, Emilia-Romagna’s Ferrara area produced a flour renowned for its fragrance, silken texture and special properties essential to making Ferrara’s famed Couple bread, <span class="italic">Coppia</span>. Understanding the flours of Emilia-Romagna, so vital to its pastas, pastries and breads, means exploring a little of its past.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">One of the most significant factors in the wealth of Emilia-Romagna has been the fertile plain created by the Po River, where wheat has flourished since at least the 14th century. The moist climate and rich soil nurtured a soft wheat. (Hard durum wheat, first introduced to Sicily by Arab invaders in the 9th century, thrived in southern Italy’s hot, dry climate and eventually became the foundation of Italy’s commercial dried pasta industry.)</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Renaissance cookbooks refer to the “flower of the flour” <span class="italic">(fiore di farina)—</span>the silkiest, whitest,  <a id="page481"/>most unadulterated of flours, reserved for the most exquisite and delicate dishes. It was rich man’s food, associated with purity and wealth. In Emilia-Romagna the flower of the flour, taken from grain grown locally, was often used not only for pastries and breads but also in local pasta recipes. Those recipes marked the beginning of the region’s reputation for outstanding pasta.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Ferrara’s early agricultural records show that the peasant, on the other hand, had coarse dark flour, bulked with bran, wheat germ, oats, rye, barley, millet, and even ground beans. Of course nutritionally he made out better than his wealthy counterpart, but usually he had little else to eat. Today we might hail such loaves as being high in fiber and all sorts of nutrients (and probably pay a premium for them), but in those days no one was delighted at the prospect of such heavy bread, no matter how nutritious.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">As wheat became more affordable, the peasant loaf grew lighter in color and consistency. It evolved into the mixed-grain breads still baked high in Emilia and Romagna’s Apennine mountains, where life changes more slowly than on the plain. Although the breads contain only locally available ingredients, as they did four centuries ago, what is available has changed. Modena Mountain Bread is an example of this living tradition and those changes. With its whole-wheat flour, crushed wheat kernels, and potato for added moisture, it not only satisfies and satiates but it reflects the greater affluence of today’s populace.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The traditional use of white flour in many of the region’s breads (especially those of the Po plain) speaks of Emilia-Romagna’s agricultural wealth, especially since the Industrial Revolution, when new milling techniques made white flour more affordable. Even <span class="italic">Piadina</span>, the humble quick bread of Romagna, has been made with white flour for at least a century.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Soft, silky flours make the finest pastries, and Emilia-Romagna’s native supply of soft wheat has given it a generous share of dishes prepared in a crust. They have evolved from elaborate court dishes like An Unusual Tortellini Pie and Domed Maccheroni Pie of Ferrara, to convent-made desserts like Riccardo Rimondi’s Spanish Sponge Cake and the unusual turnovers honoring the Duchess of Parma, to a vast collection of home-style tarts that crowd pastry shop windows from Rimini to Piacenza. Local flours may have changed over the centuries, but the rich baking traditions born in the kitchens of palaces and convents during the Medieval and Renaissance periods still flourish throughout the region.</p>

<p class="chapterHeadB" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Erbe, Odori</span></span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The foundation of many of Emilia-Romagna’s dishes is the slow browning of meats and vegetables, with herbs used only as a soft accents. Rarely does any one herb dominate a dish. Special care is needed when using rosemary, sage, thyme, juniper, and bay. Too much of these fragrant but powerful accent herbs can overwhelm a dish. In contrast, basil is a prime blending herb that melts into a pleasing backdrop for most recipes. Marjoram falls somewhere between the two extremes and is best used in small quantities.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Fresh Herbs</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Fresh herbs taste brighter, truer, and more alive than dried. They impart vitality and depth to dishes, as Tagliatelle with Caramelized Onions and Fresh Herbs vividly illustrates. Now that so many markets carry them year-round, cooking with them no longer requires an extra effort. Think about growing your own or stocking up at farmers’ markets in the summer, when herbs are inexpensive and in their prime, then freezing them for use in winter.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Freezing:</span> To freeze fresh herbs, harvest them just before they flower (when the flavor is best), rinse them, and roll them up in paper towels to absorb the moisture; then strip the leaves into plastic bags, seal well, label, and freeze. Tiny-leafed herbs like thyme, savory, and young marjoram can be frozen on their stems. Use the herbs without defrosting; simply break off what you need. The leaves will have darkened, but the flavors will be bright and fresh.</p>
<a id="page482"/>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Dried Herbs</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">If dried herbs are your only choice, select whole-leaf varieties instead of the stale-tasting powdered examples. Buy only enough to last about 3 months and store them in a cool, dark place. Before adding dried herbs to a dish, activate flavors by rubbing herbs between your palms.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Garlic</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I prefer to buy heads of large-cloved garlic. Big cloves mean less fiddling with peeling and are usually the amount I need for a dish.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Whenever people tell me they cannot or will not eat garlic, I suspect two things; burning or a garlic press. Mincing is favored over a press, as the press releases too many of garlic’s volatile oils.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Burning is responsible for much of the dislike of garlic. Burnt garlic is bitter, can upset some digestive systems, and is generally inedible. Thoughtlessly written recipes are often the culprit. So many read, “Heat the oil or butter, add the chopped onion, carrot, celery, and garlic, and cook until browned.” By the time the onion is browned, those little bits of garlic are burnt. Always add garlic after the browning is completed. Let it sauté for a few moments until it releases its aroma or is pale gold (never dark brown), and then add whatever liquid is called for to stop the browning process.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Buying and Storing:</span> Buy clean-looking large-cloved heads that are firm when pressed and show no sign of yellowing or drying out. Store garlic in an open basket at room temperature. It will generally keep in good condition about 2 weeks.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Herbs in Emilia-Romagna</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">As you travel through Emilia-Romagna, you will find subtle differences in the herbs flavoring the region’s dishes. Basil is favored in tomato-growing Parma and Piacenza, perhaps because of Piacenza’s close neighbor Liguria, where basil is all but worshiped. Along Romagna’s Adriatic coast, basil seasons grilled fish and seafoods, like Summer Clams with Balsamic Vinegar. On the slopes of the region’s Apennine mountains, juniper perfumes local game. A few stalks of thyme or leaves of bay laurel are added only occasionally to meats, poultry and game in Emilia. Marjoram is favored over its cousin, oregano. You will find marjoram in the cooking of Modena and Bologna, and in Romagna’s seafood dishes, such as Spaghetti with Shrimps and Black Olives.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Garlic is used with a gentle hand throughout the region. The bulb’s curative powers have been acclaimed since ancient times. An old saying councils, “Where you find garlic, you find health.” In Emilia-Romagna and much of Italy, garlic infusions treat many illnesses and children eat toasted bread rubbed with garlic and olive oil to ward off parasites.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Rosemary and sage (either separately or together) season foods throughout the region. <span class="italic">Aglione</span> is a blend of fresh rosemary, garlic, and salt rubbed into meats, poultry, and fish and stirred into stews throughout Modena’s countryside. And whether in Piacenza, Bologna, or Ferrara, sage often flavors dried beans.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Italian, or flat-leaf, parsley is the region’s most popular flavoring, not as a decorative garnish over finished dishes but cooked into them as a seasoning. Italian parsley evokes for me a blend of celery leaf, sweet basil, and black pepper. It is distinctive, assertive, and very different from the curly variety. Balance the sweet onions and salty anchovies in Spaghetti with Anchovies and Melting Onions with Italian parsley. Its green herbal quality intensifies the browned beef tastes of Grilled Beef with Balsamic Glaze. Those green leaves bring flavor to most of the region’s savory dishes. If Italian parsley is hard to find in your area, plant some into the garden or grow it on a sunny windowsill. Its hardiness and good taste will reward your efforts.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Much of the lard used in Emilia-Romagna’s dishes can successfully be replaced with olive oil without sacrifice in taste or authenticity. But there are a few regional recipes that lose their special goodness when oil is substituted for lard. To taste them at their best, you must use the very best lard. Flavorful lard free of chemicals is sometimes hard to find in the United States. Making your own takes almost no time, and a batch will hold in the refrigerator several weeks or 8 months in the freezer.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Ask your butcher to set aside some fresh pork fat for you. The creamy and fragrant fat around the kidney is the prized “leaf” lard. The hard layer from either side of the pig’s spinal column (known as fatback) is also prime material, but almost any blend of fresh fat will yield worthwhile results.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">To Make 1 Cup Lard:</span> Trim away any meat and connective tissue from 12 ounces of pork fat. Pour about ¼ inch of water in the bottom of a deep heavy saucepan. Add the fat and cook very slowly over medium-low to low heat until it has melted. Do not let the fat brown.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Storing:</span> Pour the melted fat through a strainer into a glass or stainless steel container, and chill. (Or pour the fat into a square cake pan, harden it in the refrigerator, and then cut it into 12 cubes. After freezing the cubes on a baking sheet, turn them into a plastic bag. These are ideal when small quantities are needed as each equals about 2 tablespoons.)</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Lard in Emilia-Romagna</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Until post-World War I affluence made butter affordable, lard was the most popular cooking fat in Emilia-Romagna. It was inexpensive (all but the poorest families had a pig, and lard could be made from leftover scraps of fat) and delicious. Today olive oil is beginning to replace much of the lard traditionally used in Emilia-Romagna’s cookery.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Aromatic lard, redolent with the natural sweetness of pork, is still vital to a few of Emilia-Romagna’s dishes. It gives the deep, full flavor and fluffiness that sets apart Romagna’s pizza-style mountain bread, the <span class="italic">Spianata</span>. <span class="italic">Piadina</span>, the simple flatbread eaten from one end of Romagna to the other, needs lard for tenderness and taste. A small amount of lard creates the crispest of crusts in the pastry enclosing Reggio’s spinach and cheese tart, <span class="italic">Erbazzone</span>.</p>

<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Buying, Using, and Storing Mortadella</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">This famous Bolognese sausage is unmistakable in appearance; it looks like a big squat torpedo encased in a dark red sheath. Italian mortadella is not exported to the United States at this writing, but good ones are produced on this side of the ocean.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">A fine mortadella is a smooth purée of soft pink pork stuffed into a natural casing. It is studded with cracked peppercorns and cubes of creamy fat (the Bolognese do not like pistachios in their mortadella). The flavor is delicate, so subtly spiced that no one seasoning stands out except the pepper. Two domestic brands worth seeking out are Primo and Santa Maria. Always taste before buying.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">When you find a sausage you like, offer it as it is done in Bologna—as an antipasto. Buy a thick slice, cut it into bite-size cubes, and spear them with long bamboo skewers. In Bologna, the local Lambrusco wine always accompanies mortadella. In the United States, try “La Monella” from the Piemontese vineyard of Braida di Giacomo Bologna, or a young, fresh Valpolicella or fizzy red Sangue di Giuda from Lombardia, or a dry white sparkling Pinot di Pinot. Once you have enjoyed mortadella on its own with no embellishments, then try a Mousse of Mortadella and taste it as a seasoning in Green Beans Bolognese.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Storing:</span> Tightly wrap sliced mortadella and refrigerate up to 4 days. With a whole sausage, cover only the cut end with plastic wrap and refrigerate up to 1½ weeks.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Mortadella in Emilia-Romagna</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The early Romans ate mortadella. It is mentioned favorably in a diary from 1376, and by the 16th century several styles were popular. According to food writers of the time, Scappi and Messisbugo, mortadella of liver (which is still made today), yellow mortadella of pork, cheese, spices, and saffron, and the ancestor of Bologna’s sausage were all served at banquets.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="Images/484a.jpg"/></p>
<p class="caption" style="text-indent:0%;">Mortadella seller in 17th-century Bologna, engraving by Giovanni M. Tamburini, from a picture by Francesco Curti, circa 1640<br/> Casa di Risparmio, Bologna</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">There are three theories of how mortadella got its name. The first has mortadella coming from <span class="italic">mortaio</span>, for the mortar in which the pork meat was transformed into a smooth paste. Another says it derives from <span class="italic">mirtatum</span>, the word for myrtle berries, centuries ago sometimes used in place of expensive peppercorns. The third claims it originated from <span class="italic">mortarium</span>, a kind of salted meat used by the <a id="page485"/>Romans. Early mortadella recipes salt the meat for several days before blending it with black wine, pepper, and spices, and pounding it into sausage stuffing.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">In the 14th century Bologna gained her reputation for mortadella because of the succulence of the local pork. Then the pork meat was pounded into a smooth cream and whipped with cinnamon, nutmeg, pepper, salt, and pieces of pork fat until light and airy. After stuffing the mixture into a large casing, the sausage was cured in a cool dry area for a short time and then cooked. It is still made that way today, with seasonings changing only slightly from one producer to the next. The stuffed sausages are hung on revolving racks in room-size ovens where they slowly roast.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Mortadelle</span> range from 1-pound bullets to man-size sausages, 6 feet long and 1½ feet wide. In 1989 a sausage from the town of Correggio-Emilia (not far from Modena and Reggio) made the <span class="italic">Guinness Book of World Records</span>. The Veroni company created a 2,864-pound mortadella that was over 19 feet long.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Although mortadella is made throughout Italy, to my mind the best ones are still to be found in Bologna and Modena, where a sixth sense guides sausage makers in their work.</p>

<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Selecting, Tasting, and Storing Olive Oils</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Since olive oils vary so much in character and since price is no indication of quality, consider finding your favorite oils by joining forces with like-minded friends. Together buy five or six oils that seem to be good candidates, and taste for your favorites.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Olive oils are graded according to how much acidity they contain and whether they are processed with or without solvents. As yet, the United States has no standard for imported Italian oils. The following designations are those of the International Olive Oil Council, of which Italy is a member. These definitions cover all Italian olive oils exported to the United States.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Extra-virgin</span> <span class="italic">(extra vergine)</span> oils are the premium ones, with not more than 1 percent acidity. They are pressed and processed without heat or solvents. The color ranges from gold to deep green, according to where and with which olives the oil is made. One color is not preferred over another. Clouded unfiltered oils are prized by many for their sometimes fuller flavor. Extra-virgin is my choice for salads and cooking. But the label is not a guarantee of a good-tasting oil, as they vary greatly in style and flavor. You must sample before settling on an oil.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Fine virgin</span> <span class="italic">(sopraffino vergine)</span> cannot exceed 1.5 percent acidity and is pressed and processed without heat or chemicals. Its flavor is more subdued than extra-virgin. Many cooks use this type of oil for cooking, saving extra-virgin for seasoning and salads.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Semi-fine virgin</span> <span class="italic">(fino vergine)</span> cannot exceed 3.3 percent acidity and is pressed and processed without heat or chemicals. This is rarely seen in the United States.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Olive oil</span> replaces what used to be called pure olive oil. Its acidity is under 4 percent but is not specifically stated. This is refined olive oil (oil treated with solvents that are steamed off after they have removed undesirable acid levels and tastes), blended with enough virgin olive oil to give it color and flavor. Refining has no effect on the nutrients in olive oil.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Light</span> is an American marketing title with no official meaning, except it usually describes refined oil with little flavor or color. Its caloric count is the same as all other olive oils, 120 calories a tablespoon. There is no reason to use these oils in cooking, as they contribute nothing to a dish.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Pomace olive oil</span> is made by heating the paste left after olives are crushed to produce all the virgin oils. Heating and processing extracts the last remaining oil from the paste, which is then blended with virgin oil.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Once you have collected likely candidates, taste by taking a small spoonful and “chewing” it, letting the oil work on your palate. Then suck air through the oil and see how distinctive flavors come through. Finally, swallow and wait for the aftertaste. At each step the oil should <span class="italic">not</span> be bland, <a id="page486"/>fatty, flat, highly acidic, bitter, or too peppery. It can be anything and everything from delicate, sweet, flowery, and almost spritzy on the tongue to very fruity or even meaty with olive character, and it can have pleasant tastes of nuts, herbs, fruits, or vegetables. There is no one paragon of oils. Flavors are determined by climate, location, weather, and production techniques. Each olive-producing area of Italy has its own style(s) of oil.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">In Emilia-Romagna the preference is for oils tasting of rich olives with sweet, lush overtones and a little pepper. The best candidates for this style are from Tuscany, Umbria, the Veneto, and Liguria. Some brand names to look for are Amoretti &amp; Gazzano, Ardoino, Raineri, Guerrieri-Rizzardi, C.A.B. (Cooperativa Agricola Brisighellese), Biondi Santi, Roselle, Col d’Orcia, Carapelli, Mancianti, and Regina Sibilla.</p>

<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Olive Oil in Emilia-Romagna</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">In Emilia-Romagna olive oil is native only to Bologna, a small part of Romagna in the Apennine foothills around Brisighella, and a tiny area of Parma province. It was the third most popular cooking medium in the region after butter and pork. Seed oils from sunflower, rapeseed, and corn are used only occasionally when their neutral character is needed. Originally they were favored for fueling oil lamps, not cooking.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Until recently, the pairing of olive oil with butter, pancetta, or prosciutto characterized a small part of Emilia-Romagna’s cuisine. With each passing year, however, more olive oil is used and less of the saturated fats. Two tradition-bound Bolognese gastronomes exclaimed recently, “Soon we’ll be eating like the Tuscans!” But in fact, neighboring Tuscany is responsible for Emilia-Romagna’s preference for fruity olive oils with hints of pepper. For centuries Emilia-Romagna’s grain was traded for Tuscany’s olive oil.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">One poignant story of that exchange was shared by Parma’s Renzo Cattabiani, Parma director of the consortium of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, in trying to communicate to me what life was like when he was a boy during World War II.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“There was so little food. Emilia was richer than the other regions—at least we had a little wheat. But Tuscany, for instance, had nothing. It all went to the army. I remember the Tuscan women would come over the high Apennines pulling wagons because their farm animals had been eaten. They were like donkeys in the traces, pulling wagons of olive oil to trade for wheat. That’s how we lived. We loved that oil. Lard, butter—no one ever saw that—but the oil meant we could cook and burn it in our lamps for light, and the wheat meant those women could live.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Olive oil no longer means sustenance. With prices in America as high as $30 or $60 a bottle, it has become a symbol of luxury. Boutique oils are now big business, with a dizzying array on the market, and price is not always an indicator of quality. Learn to trust your palate.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Although Italian pancetta is not imported into the United States, you can find good domestic examples in Italian groceries and specialty food stores. Two good brands are Rapelli and Volpi. Because of its special cure, pancetta is safe (and delicious) to eat uncooked. In Emilia-Romagna pancetta is not smoked.</p>
<a id="page487"/>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Look for cylinders about 4 inches in diameter that are spiraled with equal amounts of fat and lean. The meat should range from rosy pink to deep red. Avoid pancetta with dry or brown-looking meat or yellowish fat; the fat must be white. Have the pancetta thinly sliced, just a little thicker than you would prosciutto.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Fine pancetta is sweet, meaty, and not oversalted. Its texture should be melting and tender. The slow curing creates fat that is pleasingly creamy and flavorful, and somehow never tastes or feels fatty.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Sample before buying. Taste first for excess salt. Then, after swallowing, wait a few moments. If there is any suggestion of gaminess or rancidity, pass it by.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Storing:</span> Although freezing is never ideal, pancetta can be frozen. And considering that usually only an ounce or two is used at a time, and that in much of the country it is available only in specialty food stores, stocking up makes sense. Divide a pound or more into 1-ounce portions, put them into airtight plastic bags, and freeze up to 3 months.</p>

<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Pancetta in Emilia-Romagna</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">In Emilia-Romagna and the United States, pancetta lacks snob appeal, which may be why the pleasures of eating it by itself are often overlooked. Many know its fine cooking properties, but few realize how good pancetta is on its own.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">This bacon cut of the pig is rubbed with salt, pepper, and occasionally mild spices, and left to cure about 2 weeks. Then the piece is rolled into a compact cylinder of spiraling lean meat and snowy white fat and stuffed into a casing. After slow curing in cool, airy rooms another 2 months or more, pancetta develops a big meaty taste and satiny texture.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Although in some parts of Italy pancetta’s robust character is emphasized with smoking, Emilia-Romagna generally uses only the unsmoked variety. As with all regional cured meats, each area produces its own version. Every farmer’s <span class="italic">cantina</span> (wine cellar) has a few homemade <span class="italic">pancette</span> hanging from the rafters. Two of the most prized styles are Piacenza’s, aged 2 to 3 months, with a particularly creamy texture, and Parma’s, scented with red wine and a hint of garlic.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Pancetta is everyday food in the homes of Emilia-Romagna, where it is used for sandwiches and snacks. Even those who claim it is not quite fine enough for company will never deny what pancetta’s full flavor and silken melting qualities can do for regional dishes. Italy’s classic little antipasto meatball owes its succulence to generous amounts of ground pancetta worked into the blend of meats, cheese, and seasonings (see An Unusual Tortellini Pie, Pastas). Modena’s old recipe for pasta and lentils is lackluster without its crusty bits of browned pancetta. And many vegetable sauces, soups, and side dishes begin with sautéing a little pancetta in olive oil, like Tagliatelle with Balsamic Radicchio and Ferrara’s Soup of the Monastery.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The cheese most identified with Italy, and most imitated, is Parmigiano-Reggiano, which can be made only in Emilia and a small part of the Lombardy region’s Mantua province. It is a part skim milk cheese, aged 18 months to 3 years, and comes in old gold-colored 80-pound wheels. Parmigiano-Reggiano is a <span class="italic">grana</span> (meaning grain)-style cheese. This is the generic term for aged hard Italian cheeses whose interiors are speckled with grain-shaped white flecks of crystallized amino acids that often crackle in the mouth, as a grain might.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Selecting, Storing, and Using<br/> Parmigiano-Reggiano Cheese</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Because it is so often imitated, the identity of Parmigiano-Reggiano is subject to great confusion in the United States. To quote ethnic food authority and Parmigiano-Reggiano expert Cara De Silva, “Here the word <span class="italic">Parmesan</span> has come to be used as the generic, rather like the way Kleenex is used for tissues. But Parmigiano-Reggiano is not a kind of Parmesan; it <span class="italic">is</span> Parmesan cheese, the only Parmesan.” There are countless imitations and other kinds of grana cheeses, but only one Parmigiano-Reggiano. Its flavor and consistency are unequaled by any other cheese. Because it is an artisan-made product, no two Parmesans are the same, although all meet a minimum standard established by the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese consortium. Many surpass that standard, and those are the ones to seek out.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Appearance</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">On the rind, check for “parmigiano-reggiano” stenciled repeatedly in a vertical pattern around the cheese in lower-case letters. Make sure the oval “Export” seal is branded into the cheese, an assurance that the cheese has been double tested for soundness. Then check for age: In an open area on the rind the oval consortium mark is branded into the cheese. Near it are two other brands, one of which indicates the year in two figures (89, 90, 91), the other, in three letters, the month of production (most are clear, such as NOV for November, DEC for December; but GEN is January, MAG is May, GIU is June, and LUG is July—shortened forms of the Italian).</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">How Old:</span> Older is <span class="italic">not</span> better. Today’s Parmigiano-Reggiano usually reaches its peak at about 2 years. Before World War II, when different cows gave Parmigiano-Reggiano milk, the cheese successfully aged longer.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Some connoisseurs prefer winter cheeses for their more intense flavor and velvety texture, the result of their higher concentrations of proteins and fats. Others like the lighter, more flowery qualities of late spring or summer cheeses.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">When to Buy:</span> To get Parmigiano-Reggiano at its absolute prime, try to buy from a freshly opened cheese. Ask your favorite cheese dealer to call when a new Parmesan is about to be opened. Aside from getting a first cut, the rush of fragrance as the wheel splits apart is utterly intoxicating.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">In Italy the cheese is broken open with a series of small cuts from a stubby almond-shaped Parmigiano-Reggiano knife and a longer arrow-shaped blade. The knives do not cut into the cheese (which would compact it under the blade) as much as they break it apart, releasing its scaly, granular structure. Shops in Emilia’s cheesemaking areas that sell premium Parmigiano-Reggiano are awarded a big golden replica of the almond-shaped knife mounted on an oval plaque. It is always prominently displayed.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">An open or cut cheese should have no more than ¼ to ½ inch of dryness next to the rind. <a id="page489"/>The cheese’s interior is scaly or flakey when broken, with white dots resembling grain kernels. The color should be uniform. It can range from pale cream to a deep yellow straw color, depending on when the cheese was made. Holes in a cheese are major flaws. Do not buy Parmigiano-Reggiano with holes.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">If the cheese looks oily or has a moist sheen, it has been stored at too high a temperature and should be passed over.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Aroma:</span> It should be inviting, fragrant with scents of earth, herbs, flint, hay, cream, and sometimes flowers or fruit. There should be no suggestion of sharpness or acid.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Flavor:</span> Although no two Parmigiano-Reggianos are exactly alike, a superb one has big, deep flavors. The cheese turns creamy and crackly on the tongue, and the taste gets deeper as you chew. Most telling is the aftertaste. It should create a desire for more. Saltiness, sharpness, bitterness, tartness, shallow flavor, or an annoying tang are all signs of careless handling or an inferior cheese. When you find a fine cheese, buy what you can use over 4 weeks.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Storing:</span> Vacuum packing is the ideal way to store the cheese. Or wrap it tightly in plastic wrap. Store it in the vegetable area of the refrigerator. If vacuum packed, it will keep about 3 months. Otherwise the cheese keeps about 1 month. If it dries out, wrap it in a lightly moistened towel, and then loosely in foil or plastic wrap. Refrigerate a day, then remove the towel and wrap it up again airtight. (Freezing Parmigiano-Reggiano breaks down its structure and alters its taste.) Grate the cheese as you need it.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">How to Use:</span> The most familiar way of using Parmigiano-Reggiano is grated or shaved, as a seasoning or condiment. Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano and pasta are synonymous in Emilia-Romagna—except in seafood dishes, where the cheese competes with the fish. Most <span class="italic">risotti</span> need finishing with a handful of Parmigiano to bring their flavors into full focus (see Risotto, Soup, and Vegetable First Courses). A bowl of grated cheese is always passed with soups, whether they be of vegetables, beans, pasta, or simple broths. The cheese brightens other ingredients and seasonings without overpowering them. Shave Parmigiano-Reggiano into dishes when a more mouth-filling sense of the cheese is needed, such as the Salad of Tart Greens with Prosciutto and Warm Balsamic Dressing, or over chunky pastas.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Parmigiano-Reggiano is unparalleled as a table cheese. After a main course, serve it in a large piece at room temperature, passing the almond-shaped Parmesan knife for each diner to help him- or herself. Or break it into chunks before serving it. In Modena, chunks of Parmigiano-Reggiano sometimes are moistened with a drop or two of aged balsamic vinegar.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">During the Renaissance, court banquets in Emilia-Romagna, and as far away as Rome, featured pieces of the cheese served with fresh fennel or accompanied by platters of truffles in pomegranate sauce, roasted chestnuts, pears and apples, and vegetable tarts. Today in Parma, nothing distracts you from the pleasures of Parmigiano-Reggiano. It is served only with bread and a soft red wine. In the United States, a Barbarossa or Sangiovese Riserva from Romagna complements the cheese, as does Barbera, Dolcetto d’Alba, or a fruity Zinfandel.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Nothing matches a fine Parmigiano-Reggiano; there is no substitute.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Origins</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Artisans have been making Parmigiano-Reggiano for seven centuries. They gather annually in each province where the cheese is produced to celebrate their craft and the fellowship that unites them. It is always a night to remember—as I know from one hot evening in May when Parma’s 34th annual Cheesemaker’s Ball was starting to loosen up. Toasts had been drunk. The almost 500 cheesemakers, dairymen and their families had applauded the awards and speeches. The two young apprentices who had saved hundreds of cheeses from a dairy fire had been given a special accolade. Liveried waiters had served up an elegant meal. And now everyone was ready to relax.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Gradually the jokes in Parma dialect began, with women laughing discreetly behind their hands. Jackets were doffed, ties loosened, veneers of <a id="page490"/>aloofness allowed to fall away. A microphone was loosed from the band as officials on the dais spontaneously formed a zany quintet. Across the ballroom, I was given a serenade worthy of La Scala by two dairy farmers.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">That quintet of cheese consortium officials was the hit of the evening, with each soloing a newly made-up verse satirizing the cheesemaker’s life. Finally, everyone joined in for old folk songs sung with much laughter and sentiment. Laughing with those Parmesans (who are jokingly known as “little cheeses” in much of Italy), I marveled over the power of heritage; how the quality of that cheese and its traditions were as important to their identities as their own individuality.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Although to many Americans Parmesan means an imitation of the real thing sprinkled on pasta from a jar or can, Parmigiano-Reggiano is an eating cheese experts rank as one of the three or four finest cheeses on earth. Once a great one is tasted, it is not likely to be forgotten. Each mouthful embodies the spirit of those cheesemakers and their 700 years of tradition.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Records from the 13th century attest to the rave notices Parmigiano-Reggiano received from Italians and other Europeans as well. Because of its large size, tough crust and lengthy aging, the cheese shipped well and held up under the vagaries of poor storage. This, in addition to its appealing character, may be why we find Parmesan part of the cuisine from Sicily to England. Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese expert Dr. Mario Zannoni says it was shipped even to Constantinople during the 18th century, where it was highly favored by the Pasha’s court.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Although the cheese has been a prime export for centuries, it has never been successfully duplicated outside of Emilia. By law Parmigiano-Reggiano can be made only in the Zona Tipica, the provinces of Parma, Reggio-Emilia, Modena, part of Bologna (on the left bank of the Reno River), and in a small piece of the Lombardy region’s Mantua province that juts over the Emilia side of the Po River. Try to produce the cheese with milk from outside this area and it will not age as well, nor have quite the same depth and complexity of taste. Grana-style cheeses produced on the Po River plain outside Parmigiano-Reggiano’s zone are usually called <span class="italic">grana padano</span>, meaning grana of the Po plain.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Parmigiano-Reggiano was first made in the Enza River valley, which separates what are now the provinces of Reggio-Emilia and Parma. For the past 500 years Reggio was part of Ferrara and later Modena’s holdings, while the cheese was strongly identified with Parma. Hence the old reference to the cheese simply as “Parmigiano.” When an official consortium was formed in 1934 by cheese producers and dairymen to define the zone and to control quality, Reggio finally got what she felt was her due, and the cheese officially became Parmigiano-Reggiano.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Although speculation exists about the ancient Etruscans making a Parmesan-like cheese in Emilia, the first references to a cheese called <span class="italic">Parmigiano</span> did not appear until the 1300s. Most famous was Boccaccio’s description in the <span class="italic">Decamaron</span> of the luscious-sounding land of Bengodi. In that mythical land of plenty, he described a mountain of grated Parmigiano where ravioli makers perched, fashioning the little squares of pasta and rolling them down the slopes so they arrived at the bottom coated in savory cheese, ready to eat.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Agriculture exploded in Emilia-Romagna during the late 13th and early 14th centuries, when the marshes of the vast Po plain were drained and irrigation systems developed. Cows and oxen brought in to plow the new fields grew fat on the rich grazing land. The cows gave more milk than could possibly be drunk, so cheese was made. Because of those lush pastures, the milk was especially high in the proteins, fats, and other substances necessary for a cheese to age well. And so a large cheese that kept for a long time was born.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Parmigiano-Reggiano was prized far beyond Italy’s borders, as proved by Samuel Pepys, the gossipy 17th-century English diarist. On September 14, 1666, he wrote that he had saved his important papers, wine, and “Parmazan” cheese from the Great Fire of London by burying them in the back garden. And British gentlemen of the time who took the then-required Grand Tour consistently wrote of Italy’s best cheese, Parmigiano.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Mountain climbers to this day depend on Parmigiano’s easily digested proteins to produce quick and long-lasting energy. The cheese’s nutrients sustained French dramatist Jean-Baptiste Molière, who lived on it and little else through much of his old age. He may have initiated a fad, for in Molière’s day the Parmigiano diet was fashionable—three glasses of port and 12 ounces of Parmigiano per day—in Parisian theatrical circles.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Thomas Jefferson was captivated by the cheese on his visits to Italy, and asked that it be shipped to him in the Colonies.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Robert Louis Stevenson carried a piece of Parmesan in his snuff box, claiming it was very nutritious as well as pleasingly aromatic. In Stevenson’s <span class="italic">Treasure Island</span>, Dr. Livesey filled his snuff box in the same way.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Pepys, Jefferson, and Molière valued Parmigiano for its flavor, but today its great monetary worth makes the cheese business collateral for development loans. Wheels of Parmigiano-Reggiano are often aged in secured “banks.” Cheese bank robberies, when Parmigianos valued at six and seven figures disappear, are reported in the international press. Considering that one wheel is worth about $800 on the retail market, the disappearance of a truckload is a major loss.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">How Parmigiano-Reggiano Is Made</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">In over 1,000 small cheese dairies, or <span class="italic">caselli</span>, throughout the zone, Parmigiano-Reggiano is made by artisans every day of the year. Until 1984, cheese made between April 1 and November 11 bore the name Parmigiano-Reggiano, while winter cheese was called <span class="italic">Vernengo</span> (from <span class="italic">inverno</span>, winter). Today, because of changes in calving practices, Parmigiano-Reggiano is produced all year round.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">To become a master cheesemaker, or <span class="italic">casaro</span>, of Parmigiano-Reggiano requires an apprenticeship of 10 to 14 years, followed by a life making cheese 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year, with no holidays until retirement. As one master told me: “The cows give milk twice a day no matter what. They don’t stop because it’s Christmas.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The cheesemaker receives little scientific training and often might have only 5 years of formal schooling. Yet consortium scientists who research the hows and whys of Parmigiano-Reggiano all bow to the cheesemaker’s instincts and skill. This skill is constantly challenged as the milk’s levels of acid, fat, and protein vary throughout the year. This means few batches of cheese are made exactly the same way. One scientist, Dr. Leo Bertozzi, observed, “In my opinion, fine cheese is 30 percent the milk and 70 percent the skill of the cheesemaker.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">In payment, the cheesemaker receives a generous salary, a home attached to the dairy, and all the ricotta and butter he chooses to make and sell from the skimmed cream and whey. Frequently he keeps pigs, which are fattened on whey from the cheese, becoming, among other delicacies, Prosciutto di Parma.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The master and his assistant work each morning at big copper vats shaped like inverted <a id="page492"/>bells. They blend skimmed milk from the previous evening’s milking with whole milk from that morning’s milking. Whey from the previous day’s cheesemaking and rennet (the stomach lining of suckling calves) are added as the milk is heated, cooled, and reheated. Newly formed curd is carefully broken up and cooked by the cheesemaker until it is finally time to shape a Parmesan.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Forming the curds into a wheel of cheese is a two-man operation. Heavy curds from the bottom of the 4-foot-deep kettle are scooped with a wooden paddle into a large cheesecloth. Once hefted up to the kettle’s rim, the soft white curd is drained in cheesecloth sacks and then pressed into round wooden forms. After most of the whey has drained off, a metal perforating stencil is slipped around each cheese, marking it with the repeating “parmigiano-reggiano” logo.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The cheeses rest for several days in their wooden forms before being unmolded and placed in salt brine 20 to 25 days. After a brief drying, their long aging begins, either at the cheese dairy or at one of the huge communal aging rooms throughout the zone. There each one is brushed, turned, and tested regularly during its 18- to 24-month maturation. A cheese that meets the consortium standards, that is, has no holes and is not soured or spoiled in any way, receives an oval Consorzio della Formaggio Parmigiano-Reggiano brand and is also marked with the month and year of its birth. As negotiants buy cheeses for resale, they add their brands and metal identification discs.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">A problem with a cheese is quickly traced to its source. Each cheese is marked with a production date and vat number and, as each vat in the <span class="italic">casello</span> always contains the same farm’s milk, problems can be tracked instantly. Part of the cheesemaker’s expertise is knowing every dairy and every cow.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Every person connected with Parmigiano-Reggiano labors with relentless regularity—except the cows. Known in cheese country as <span class="italic">mucce</span> (pronounced “mookey”), the cows lounge away their lives in spacious stalls. It is the farmer, not the <span class="italic">mucce</span>, who trudges out to pasture, collects precious grass, trudges back, and then all but hand-feeds it to the animals.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Driving through Emilia’s lush countryside and never seeing a cow was disconcerting to me until it was explained that the natural and material wealth of the area was the cheese’s greatest asset and its worst liability. The region’s wealth from agriculture and trade made expensive animal proteins like meat and Parmigiano-Reggiano affordable to many, leading to more production of these products. At the same time, that wealth led to burgeoning towns and growing industry swallowing up grazing land. Now the grass in those diminishing pastures is too precious to allow trampling by grazing cows. And so dairy farmers have become grass cutters.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">The Parmigiano-Reggiano Cheese Song</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Verdi’s achievements will not be threatened by this playful piece, but how many cheeses can claim a song dedicated to their greatness? And how fitting that the cheese born in the land of Toscanini, Pavarotti and Verdi should have a musical tribute.</p>

<p class="chapterHeadA1" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">Porcini Mushrooms</span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The porcino reigns as Italy’s king of wild mushrooms because of its meaty character and versatility in the kitchen. Both fresh and dried porcini are prized in everything from salads, pastas, soups, and side dishes to main dishes of poultry, meats, and game.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Selecting, Storing, and Using Dried and Fresh Porcini Mushrooms</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Dried porcini stand in when fresh are not available, but the two are used in different ways. Tasting so intensely of beef, earth, and woods, dried porcini often function as a seasoning, not a main ingredient.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Dried porcini are sold both loose and in plastic bags ranging from ½ ounce to 2 pounds. If you are purchasing them in Italy, always check the package for the expiration date, which should be at least 6 months in the future. On either side of the Atlantic, make sure “porcini” is stated on the label, not simply “wild mushrooms.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Look for large pieces, colored from beige to dark brown (pale mushrooms are usually more delicate in taste, dark ones more robust), with only a little dust and crumbled mushroom at the bottom of the package. Then turn the package upside down so the dust falls past the transparent plastic window found on almost every bag. If the dust is weblike or if it moves on its own, do not buy the mushrooms.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The aroma should be appealing, with strong scents of earth, beef bouillon, and aromatic woods. If the mushrooms smell stale or musty, do not buy them.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Storing:</span> Dried porcini hold well 6 to 8 months if kept dry, cool, and away from light. Store them in sealed plastic bags or glass jars in a cool closet or cabinet. If you stocked up on more than you will use in 8 months, freeze the mushrooms in well-sealed plastic bags.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Preparing Dried Porcini:</span> You must remove all sand and soften dried porcini before cooking them. To wash them, drop the pieces into a bowl of cold water, swish them around vigorously, and pause a few seconds, letting the particles of grit settle to the bottom of the bowl. Then quickly scoop out the mushrooms with your hands, and repeat the process two to three times, or until very few particles appear. Alternately, large pieces can be rinsed under cold running water.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Soften the mushrooms by covering them with hot water and soaking them about 30 minutes. Remove them from the liquid (if more sand particles have appeared, rinse the mushroom pieces again), and use as directed in recipe.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The mushrooms’ soaking liquid is almost as prized as the porcini themselves. Often it is strained through a paper-towel-lined sieve into the dish being cooked, as in Meat Ragù with Marsala or Porcini Veal Chops. If it is not called for in the dish you are making, strain the liquid anyway and freeze it. Porcini liquid gives a meaty accent to soups, stews, sauces, and sautés.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Cooking with Dried Porcini:</span> The mushroom adds a robust flavor, invaluable in meatless dishes like Lasagne of Wild and Fresh Mushrooms.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Dried porcini are particularly good with tomatoes, as illustrated in Piacenza’s Porcini Tomato Sauce. Try sautéing a small quantity of softened porcini with fresh champignon-type mushrooms as a side dish to meat and poultry dishes.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Porcini blend well with most herbs, and they shine with garlic and onion. So many dishes of poultry, meat, and game gain depth and richness from just a few dried porcini added to their cooking juices; see Mardi Gras Chicken and Ragù of Giblets.</p>
<a id="page495"/>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Fresh Porcini</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Look for fresh porcini in specialty markets during the spring and fall. Small to medium-size mushrooms (3 to 5 inches tall) have less chance of being woody or coarse than larger ones. The coloring on the caps ranges from beige to yellow to dark brown. Avoid any that are moist, discolored, or bruised. The mushrooms should be firm and unwrinkled, and should smell of the earth.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Storing:</span> To store fresh porcini, wrap them loosely in paper towels and refrigerate no more than 2 days.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Cooking with Fresh Porcini:</span> Clean fresh porcini by wiping off particles of sand or debris with a damp cloth. Do not immerse them in water.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The flavor of fresh porcini is far more subtle than that of its dried counterpart. Use them the same way, in simple preparations where the natural flavor of the mushroom stands out. Cooked or raw fresh porcini taste marvelous with shavings of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. The caps of large porcini are often grilled with olive oil, garlic, and parsley, and eaten as a second course.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Slip a few slices of sautéed fresh porcini inside a veal chop, as in the original version of Porcini Veal Chops. Sautéed fresh porcini become a sauce for pasta; see Tagliatelle with Fresh Porcini Mushrooms.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Thinly slice one or two mushrooms, arrange on each salad plate, and drizzle lightly with olive oil and a little lemon juice. Top with shavings of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. You can approximate the taste of fresh porcini by using a combination of dried ones and fresh cultivated mushrooms, as in Oven-Glazed Porcini.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Porcini in Emilia-Romagna</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Scientifically, the porcino is <span class="italic">Boletus edulis</span>. In France they are called <span class="italic">cèpes</span>. But Italy is more playful, dubbing them <span class="italic">porcini</span>, or “little pigs.” Imagining a mushroom as a well-fed piglet is easy once you see the porcino’s plump domed cap and its stout stem.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Fresh porcini appear first in March or April and continue through July. They return in greater abundance from September to November. Their flavor and aroma call up veal cooked in white wine and the loamy scents of deep forests. Throughout Emilia-Romagna the mushroom season is celebrated with simple dishes like grilled porcini caps, salads of raw porcini with shavings of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, pastas sauced with buttery porcini sautés, porcini cooked into risotto, porcini gratins finished with balsamic vinegar, and soups of porcini.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">In areas where the mushrooms flourish, restaurants often give over their whole menu to wild mushroom dishes, with the porcino as star. Each province has its own source of especially fine mushrooms. For instance, Parma prizes the porcini of Borgo Val di Taro, in her province’s Apennine foothills. Until a few years ago, there was a restaurant in the hills of Reggio that opened only in the spring and autumn mushroom seasons. There was no written menu, only dish after dish made with porcini that the cook, a woman well into her eighties, had gathered herself. Lamentably, the old cook had passed away and the restaurant closed.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">All over Italy, people still hunt for and dry their own mushrooms. Once, while interviewing the owner of a Parma food shop, I noticed several brands of dried porcini on display. I asked him which he thought were the most flavorful. Not realizing I was referring to the packaged mushrooms, he enthusiastically replied, “There is a hillside on your right just as you go out on the western road. My family always finds the best porcini there.” Obviously those packages were for the uninitiated.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Since Roman times the term <span class="italic">prosciutto</span> (from <span class="italic">prosciugare</span>, meaning to lose water, to dry up) has applied to a cured rear leg of pork as well as wild boar, deer, chamois, wild goat, and sometimes even breast of goose. But today <span class="italic">prosciutto</span> generally means ham of pork.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">There are two kinds of prosciutto: <span class="italic">crudo</span>, or raw, and <span class="italic">cotto</span>, or cooked. Prosciutto crudo is cured and aged raw ham, requiring no cooking before <a id="page496"/>serving. Prosciutto cotto is mildly cured ham that is precooked by roasting or steaming, much like American boiled ham, but with no water added.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">At this time, Prosciutto di Parma (Parma ham) from Emilia-Romagna is the only Italian prosciutto crudo allowed to be imported into the United States. Prosciutto cotto from several areas in Italy is also imported.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Selecting, Using, and Storing Prosciutto</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Prosciutto crudo is usually served as an antipasto, accompanied only by bread and wine, and occasionally fruit. In Modena it is offered along with coppa and salami, a platter of marinated vegetables, and a basket of hot bread fritters (see Antipasto Castelvetro, The Antipasto Course). Romagnoli snack on their prosciutto by stuffing it into folded rounds of warm <span class="italic">Piadina</span>. Throughout Italy prosciutto is a favorite sandwich filling. It can be wrapped around asparagus or bread sticks, or speared on long picks with chunks of cheese.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Flavoring dishes with ham goes back at least as far as the Roman period. Today prosciutto is cooked and/or blended into sautés, sauces, soups, stews, and pasta fillings.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Emilia-Romagna produces one of Europe’s most highly regarded hams—the Prosciutto di Parma, famed for its fragrance and concentrated natural sweetness. It can be cured only in Parma province.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">However, prosciutto of all kinds is made in the region’s hills and mountains. Although often coarser than Parma ham, each prosciutto has its own appeal. They are as different as the people who make them, whether they be mountain farmers who cure just enough hams to sustain themselves and to sell for next year’s animal feed, the regional artisans who fiercely guard their curing secrets and supply only a handful of restaurants and shops, or the executives of large meat factories that ship thousands of hams throughout Italy and Europe.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">At Bertinoro, the Medieval mountain village sitting on a balcony-like cliff over Romagna’s vineyards and plain, you can taste a prosciutto from higher up in the hills, near Tuscany. It is moist and salty, with a bold, meaty character, and is perfect with the area’s Griddle Bread.</p>

<p class="chapterHeadB" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Parma Ham</span></span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Fragrant and sweet, Prosciutto di Parma is one of the world’s most sought-after hams. It can be produced only in the hills of Parma province in an area designated by law. Cured solely with salt and aged 10 months to 2 years, each step of the process is dictated by law and overseen by the Parma Ham Consortium (Consorzio del Prosciutto di Parma). To qualify as a true Parma ham, the meat must have the brand of Parma’s five-pointed ducal crown seared into its side.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Selecting, Storing, and Using Parma Ham</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Although every ham bearing the Parma crown meets the consortium’s standard, some exceed it. Those are the hams to look for. You will find them in shops specializing in high-quality Italian foods and catering to a demanding clientele. Always examine and taste before selecting a prosciutto.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">No two Parma hams are alike. They are made by artisans and reflect the individuality of their creators. Older hams often taste earthy, with a pleasant mustiness or ripeness and more assertive saltiness. Younger hams taste of pork’s natural sweetness and can have scents of fresh-cut hay. For the uninitiated, the younger ham is more accessible; the older is more of an acquired taste. No hams under 400 days old enter the United States. In Italy, Parma hams must attain a minimum of 10 months and can be aged up to 2 years.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">When buying, check first for the Parma crown branded into the side of the ham. Then look for large hams or pieces of large hams, as the denser the muscle the sweeter the meat. Check meat and fat color, aroma and always taste. The ham has two major sets of muscles. The thicker will always be more generously marbled, and have the milder and sweeter flavor. The shallower muscle will be more mature and intense in character, often saltier.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Prosciutto is often shipped in vacuum packing. Once the original wrapper is removed, the meat must breathe and should not be sealed airtight. Make sure the first slice of an already cut ham is discarded, as it will be dry.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The meat should be soft pink to deep rose, with a fine marbling of fat running through the lean. The fat should be rose-toned where it touches meat and white farther away—never yellow. A thick fat covering on untrimmed ham is desirable.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The ham should be fragrant, with scents of hay, roasted meat, sweetness, and yeastiness. Any suggestion of ammonia or rancidity indicates a poor ham. The flavor, depending on age, should be sweet or like well-ripened fruit, with some earthiness; delicate but round, with intensely meaty undertones. Salt should be a backdrop. Wait a few beats after swallowing. If there is a rancid aftertaste, the ham has been stored improperly; do not buy it.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Prosciutto is always sliced paper-thin. Slices must lie side by side, never stacked. If you are slicing a whole unboned ham, set it on its side with the shank bone pointing downward. Slice the top muscle horizontally, parallel to the femur bone. Remove the bones and then slice the thicker muscle vertically. If you are working with boned ham, slice across the grain (vertically) throughout. Slice the ham as close to serving time as possible, and keep the slices covered.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Storing:</span> Presliced prosciutto should be purchased as close to serving time as possible. Keep it sealed and chilled until about an hour before dining. It will hold in decent condition up <a id="page498"/>to 2 days if stored in the refrigerator at 42° to 46°F. The prosciutto must be well wrapped and sealed in its original wrapper to protect the slices from drying out.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Wrap large chunks of prosciutto in porous fabric, such as cheesecloth or a kitchen towel, allowing the ham to breathe, and store it in the refrigerator at 42° to 46°F (the vegetable crisper is an ideal location). Freezing ruins Prosciutto di Parma, diminishing its flavor and changing its texture.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Serving:</span> Always serve the ham at room temperature. For a classic antipasto, serve as in Parma. Arrange three to four slices side by side on a plate, accompanied not by fruit but simply by bread (see The Antipasto Course). Drink a lively, fruity white wine. In Parma it will be a dry, slightly spritzy Malvasia from the same hills where the prosciutto is made. Here drink a crisp white Portuguese Vinho Verde, or a Galestro from Tuscany.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">If the only available Parma ham is full-flavored but salty, serving it with ripe melon, fresh figs, or pears will help blunt the salt’s impact. Hot Caramelized Pears with Prosciutto is another way of enjoying these hams.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Parma ham is never served cooked and hot, as you would a steak or chop. It is cooked only when it seasons dishes—for example, in Tagliatelle with Prosciutto di Parma, Parsley Pasta with Tomato and Peas Villa Gaidello, or Sweet Peas Parma.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">When cooking with Prosciutto di Parma, I usually cook a little chopped ham into the base sauté of a dish, building a foundation of flavor, and then sprinkle slivers of uncooked ham over the finished recipe for impact.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Parma Ham in Emilia-Romagna</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Eating the ham in Parma is a purist’s paradise. It is always an antipasto with three or four semi-transparent slices draped over a plate. I have never seen fruit, sauces or garnishes served with the prosciutto there. Bread and the fizzy white Malvasia wine from the same hills that the ham comes from are its only accompaniments. Even butter with the bread is debated. Some Parmesans declare it an affectation.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The rosy red meat with its edging in white fat tastes like someone infused the flavors of nuts, cream, ripe fruit and meat essence into a ham.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">If the taste is memorable, the prosciutto’s texture will equal it. The meat is supple, concentrated rather than dried, and feels silky on the tongue. But to me, most startling is the vitality of taste. The ham is still evolving, like a good wine. And that sense comes through in every mouthful.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Three ingredients are necessary to make Parma ham: salt, air, and time. The list of what is <span class="italic">not</span> allowed is much longer: no sugar, spices, smoke, water, nitrites, nor any of the dubious substances often associated with modern ham production. Salt is allowed, and .035 ounces of sodium nitrate per 2.2 pounds salt is legal, but few producers employ nitrates.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">If the ingredients are simple, the process is intricate. Producers of Prosciutto di Parma share one goal: to cure a leg of pork with an absolute minimum of salt in order to keep the meat as sweet-tasting and as supple as possible while retarding spoilage. Maintaining a good balance is the challenge. The maker’s skill is also challenged by the exacting process that produces the ham’s silky texture.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Parmesans have had 2,000 years to perfect their ham and to take advantage of a unique combination of resources.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">According to the Parma Ham Consortium, it was a hundred years before Christ when Cato first mentioned ham in Parma in his <span class="italic">Architecture of Agriculture</span>. He speaks of curing legs of wild Parma pig by layering them in barrels with salt. Prized for their taste, they became favorite Roman banquet fare and were shipped south regularly.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Salt was a precious commodity, as it was vital to preserving and seasoning so many foods, and each time it crossed a boundary, the Romans imposed heavy duties. Luckily, what is now Parma province (then a Roman military post) had its own supply.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Parma’s near neighbor, Salsomaggiore, had natural salt deposits, which contained important components that may have gone a long way in shaping Parma’s taste for delicately cured pork products. Salsomaggiore’s salt contained boric <a id="page499"/>carbonate and boric acid, which soften and sweeten meat while imbuing it with a rainbow-colored iridescence. Today their use is banned, and that tender sweetness is achieved by other methods. But sweetness and tenderness still single out modern Parma ham from coarser prosciutti.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">As Salsomaggiore’s salt supply dwindled, the microclimate in and around the village of Langhirano in the foothills of the Apennines was discovered. Breezes from the east and west sweep the area constantly. Ham makers claim they contribute mightily to the ham’s special flavor. Salt air from the Ligurian and Tuscan coasts to the west dries out during its passage over the mountains. Moist air from Parma’s Po plain to the east is sweetened with scents of orchards, wheat fields, hay bales, vineyards, and farms. Cool temperatures, low humidity, and the primal elements of salt and sweet created an ideal setting for prosciutto.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">At first, producing ham was literally a cottage industry, with prosciutto hung in homes from attic to cellar. By the end of the 19th century Langhirano’s architecture was dominated by long, narrow, multistoried buildings where the hams are still cured. These “apartment houses for hams” are situated on an angle to catch the breezes from the mountains and the plain. Movable shutters on their tall windows protect the hams from the direct sun while allowing the air to flow freely.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">How Prosciutto di Parma Is Made</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The pigs, of course, were the other vital ingredient. Until about six centuries ago, Parma’s stretch of the Po River plain was thickly forested in chestnut and oak. Those forests gave the local wild pigs forage that was so lush, it was unequaled in all Italy. So Parma’s pig was fat—all the better to produce a velvety, succulent ham. Contemporary Parma ham producers insist that lean meat does not make great prosciutto.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The Parma ham consortium and its member producers make a strong distinction between salted meat and prosciutto. One expert, Ettore Grisendi, says, “It is easy to preserve meat with large amounts of salt. But skill and patience are required to maintain the natural sweetness of the meat while using little salt.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">A vital part of the process is drying and gradually remoistening the hams by slowly bringing them from high, airy attics down to moist cellars. This may have first occurred centuries ago by accident, but today it is vital to Prosciutto di Parma’s character.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Each and every step is like that, with one minute detail after another finally adding up to a good prosciutto. The ham is helpless and needs constant attention. Ham people say the prosciutto wants care like a baby. They describe the creation of a Parma ham as “Si da prosciutto balia,” “To give the ham to a wet nurse.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Prosciutto pigs come from crossing five approved breeds. They must spend at least the last 4 months of their lives on the Po plain in the regions of Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy, Piedmont, or the Veneto. The pigs feed on a prescribed diet of grains and whey from cheese production (in Parmigiano-Reggiano country, in fact, every cheese factory has its own band of pigs).</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Animals mature to at least 1 year and must weigh between 352 and 440 pounds. “<span class="italic">Molto fatto</span>,” or “well made,” describes the ideal pig with a firm, well-developed muscle structure containing a minimum amount of water.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Water and acid are the enemies of Parma ham. Younger, less developed meat contains more water. More water means more salt absorption which can block the fermentation process. That process helps develop the simple proteins necessary to the ham’s velvety texture and complex flavor.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Acid content is controlled by the method of slaughter. If the animal is stressed, PH rises and so does salt absorption. Today all pigs meet their demise in a calm state.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Legs are trimmed to the shape of a chicken drumstick, and after rigid inspection are marked with the acceptance symbol “PP.” Large legs with a thick fat cover are preferred. They absorb less salt during curing because of their greater maturity and denser, drier muscle.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">At the factory, <span class="italic">la salagione</span> (the salting) marks the pork’s first contact with salt, when coarse sea salt is massaged into the meat. During the following 25 days of refrigeration a second salting is done. Most crucial at this first step is controlling the <a id="page500"/>intake of salt by making daily adjustments in temperature and humidity. With high humidity more salt is absorbed; with low humidity, less salt. The challenge is to avoid spoilage yet slow down the penetration of salt as much as possible.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Fluctuating humidity and temperature continues during <span class="italic">il riposo</span> (the rest), when the hams hang for 2 months, still in refrigerated rooms. The meat is now dull brown. It will return to its original rosy color without any additives aiding the process by the end of the curing and aging.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Il riposo</span> ends with <span class="italic">la toletta</span> (the cleaning and trimming), when the meat is trimmed away from the femur bone’s knob and the protruding aitch bone is cut to lie flat against the ham’s surface. After removing excess salt with a wash of warm water, the hams are hung to dry 3 to 6 days.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Pre stagionatura</span> (the pre-aging) marks the hams’ gradual 4-month journey from dry, airy attics, where they are perfumed by aromatic breezes as the salt finishes permeating the meat, to moist half-cellars. By the end of 4 months, the meat’s surface is sealed by drying and hardening. At this point the legs of pork are merely salted meat, not yet Prosciutti di Parma. <span class="italic">La toletta secca</span> (the covering of exposed meat with softened suet) helps the ham remoisten itself. It initiates <span class="italic">la stagionatura</span>, the aging and fermenting process that creates Parma ham.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">As the round, bare meat area on the ham gets coated with suet, a fine line is left uncovered at the join between the lean meat and the covering of fat. Now the ham hangs another 4 or 5 months while the moisture in the heart of the prosciutto seeks escape through that uncovered line of meat. The moisture spreads gradually throughout the entire ham. This remoistening marks the beginning of fermentation. Fermentation takes the salted leg of pork across that crucial line to become Prosciutto di Parma.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Enzymes and biochemical reactions work at the meat’s structure by breaking down its proteins. Over 4 or 5 months, complex proteins break down to simple proteins, giving the prosciutto its singular texture and making it easier to digest than fresh pork. Slowly the color changes back to the original soft rose. At about 10 months Prosciutto di Parma comes into full flower. Some prefer it aged more; but all agree that these final months are vital to the distinctive character of the ham. (For U.S. export, 400 days are required.)</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">When the United States government tested Parma ham for reentry after a 20-year absence, another aspect of the curing process was discovered. Parma ham is self-sterilizing. The 400-day process annihilates pork’s four most potent diseases (hog cholera, African swine fever, hoof and mouth disease, and viscular disease), leaving not even any residue to give evidence of their demise.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Branding with the five-pointed ducal crown of Parma completes the exacting process. No ham is branded unless inspected by the consortium, and a ham without a crown is not a Prosciutto di Parma. Using a horse bone, consortium inspectors perform <span class="italic">la puntatura</span> (the puncturing) by piercing every ham at five crucial points and inhaling the scent of each. The bone whittled from a horse’s femur has no odor of its own and little porosity. It releases aromas quickly, so that an inspector can move from ham to ham with surprising speed.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Fatal flaws in a ham are rancidity and oversalting. Each place on the ham gives up a different scent, ranging from the aroma of roasted meat to floweriness to old straw.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Because the ham’s proteins have been broken down during fermentation, they are absorbed quickly by the body and offer a fast, sound source of energy. In Italy you always hear of mountain climbers and other sportsmen touting the benefits of Prosciutto di Parma.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">This is no news to Emilians. They knew that over 1,000 years ago, when Hannibal of elephants-crossing-the-Alps fame paused in the valley of the Trebbia, north of Parma. There he fortified himself and his army with the local bread, the local wine, and the ancestor of today’s Prosciutto di Parma. At that moment the military genius became a gastronome.</p>

<p class="chapterHeadB" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Ferrara’s Juicy Salame</span></span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">This Ferrara specialty can be seen hanging from the rafters of every meat market and delicatessen in the province, looking like clusters of cannonballs and radiating aromas of meat ripened with wine and spices. <span class="italic">Salama da sugo</span> translates literally as “juicy or sauced salame” because of its moist center. It is made and served like no other salame in Emilia-Romagna.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Although now controlled by a consortium, salama da sugo’s production has not changed much in 500 years. For all that time it has appeared at banquets, holidays, and festivals.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The <span class="italic">salama</span>, or <span class="italic">salamina</span> (little salame), as it is known affectionately, is made with a collection of ingredients that reads like the shopping list for a Medieval dinner party. Meat is taken from at least five areas of the pig; liver, tongue, and sometimes heart are added. Then nutmeg, salt, clove, pepper, and cinnamon are blended in. Once the mixture has mellowed overnight, it gets a generous dose of red wine.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Everything is stuffed into a round casing and tied to emulate the jewel cases and decorative jars of centuries ago that were round, lobed and shaped like melons. One poet in the 1700s called the salama “a jewel case filled with love.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">What the salama really is full of is moist, aromatic meat. After 6 months to a year of careful curing, the globe is soaked overnight in water and then steamed or poached with great care. It is always a main course, served hot on a platter of potato purée. The favorite way of presenting it at home is with the top cut away and a spoon plunged into its center, where the piquant meats are at their best.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">For outlanders salama da sugo can be an acquired taste—its pungency often overwhelms the palate. But if you are in Ferrara, you must sample this holdover from the feasts of the Este court, because it is available nowhere else in Italy, nor in the United States.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Technically speaking, a <span class="italic">salame</span> (the singular of <span class="italic">salami</span>) is a blend of chopped meat, seasonings, salt, and possibly an additional preservative, all stuffed into a casing and dry-cured for up to 6 or 7 months. It is eaten uncooked (the curing process rids the meat of any harmful organisms).</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Selecting, Storing, and Using Salami</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">As of this writing, Italian salami are not imported into the United States. Seek out good domestic ones that are seasoned as closely as possible to the style of Emilia-Romagna. Most of the salami in Emilia-Romagna are coarsely ground. Big, meaty tastes dominate them, with garlic and black pepper only as accents, along with hints of wine, clove, cinnamon, or nutmeg—no heavy doses of hot pepper or fennel.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The sausage casing should be natural, not plastic. The label should list meat, salt, spices, possibly dry milk, and one or two preservatives. In cured meats, less is most certainly more. Long lists <a id="page502"/>of chemicals, and the addition of water and sweeteners, are not found in well-made naturally cured salami. Types to look for are Cacciatore (hunter’s salami in short links), Toscano, and Veneto.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Taste for a pleasant balance of seasonings, lack of chemical overtones, and a good meaty flavor. Let the aftertaste blossom by waiting a few moments. If there is any sense of rancidity or unpleasant flavor, do not buy the salami.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Storing:</span> If you are using the salami within about 24 hours, you can buy it presliced. Store it in the refrigerator, well sealed in its original wrapper. Store chunks of unsliced salami, unwrapped, in the refrigerator (sealing them airtight encourages spoilage). They will keep for a month or more, continuing to dry and ripen. Trim away dry end pieces before slicing.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Serving:</span> Salami is a fine antipasto on its own or served with prosciutto and coppa as in much of Emilia-Romagna (see Antipasto Castelvetro, The Antipasto Course). If you are serving it alone, count on about ¼ to 1 ounce per person.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Salami is cut on the diagonal, forming ovals. The thickness is a matter of personal taste. Slender salami are often cut about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch thick, while plumper or drier ones are sliced thinner. Serve the salami at room temperature, with Crispy Fritters, Modena Mountain Bread, or chewy store-bought bread. Simple but full red wines are the best foils for salami. In much of Emilia, a dry local Lambrusco is favored. In the United States, drink a lively red Sangue di Giuda from Lombardy, a young Sangiovese from Romagna, or light-bodied Cabernet from Friuli.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Salami in Emilia-Romagna</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">In Italy, the kind of salami you eat speaks of who you are. For many Italians their area’s salami, along with the innumerable other forms of preserved pork, are part of their identity. Ask a Florentine about his city’s fennel-flavored <span class="italic">finocchiona</span>, or a Neapolitan to explain the elements of lightly smoked <span class="italic">salame di Napoli</span>, and be prepared for a passionate discourse on the salami. It will range over regional and family history as well as artisanship, all laced with fierce personal opinions on where, when, and how to eat them.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">In Emilia-Romagna, pork has reigned in supreme succulence since before the days of the Caesars. Parmesans feast proudly on their <span class="italic">salame Felino</span>, claiming its special sweetness is garnered from the hay and grass-scented air of Felino’s countryside. In Ferrara, a slick Armani-clad young man, seemingly with no interest in food much less culinary traditions, overhears my questions in a shop. He proudly volunteers that his mother and grandmother still make <span class="italic">zantil</span> (Ferrara’s chewy garlic-and-wine-scented salame that looks like a wizened baseball bat). I ask, “You eat it because it’s of your family, right?” “Well, yes,” is the shrugged response, “but if you are Ferrarese, you eat zantil. In Piacenza <span class="italic">salame Piacentino</span> must be tasted, but that is for the Piacentini. I am of Ferrara.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The artisan- and family-made salami still found in some of the region’s shops and restaurants (ask for <span class="italic">salame artisanale</span>) are often a revelation. The concentration of pure meat taste is always memorable. A superb salami gives the sense that someone separated each component of taste and texture and accented each one, making the reassembled whole greater than the sum of its individual parts.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Emilia-Romagna’s seasoning philosophy is “keep it subtle.” Blends of salt, pepper, spices, and some wine let the character of the meat shine through. But as you travel from town to town, you will find subtle shadings of taste—an herbal or flowery quality picked up from the local air; the touch of clove, cinnamon, pepper, or coriander; lacings of garlic; the enrichment of rich red wine. And occasionally, especially in Romagna, hot pepper provides a little punch.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Years ago the Romagnoli called salami slices “gold pieces.” Although Emilia-Romagna has always had a wealth of meat compared to much of Italy, before World War II many peasants and laborers ate meat only on Christmas and Easter. Usually it was boiled to stretch it as far as possible. A few slices of salami was the roast of the poor. Made from pieces of pork that could not be successfully preserved whole, it was more affordable than solid cuts of cured shoulder or prosciutto.</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">And it was almost all meat, unlike the mostly fat pancetta and pork jowl that provided flavoring in dishes of the day. Pieces of gold, indeed. A salami would be doled out tenderly, savored small bit by small bit.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Today salami is a snack food and is prized as an antipasto. It is held dear when well made, but salami as celebration food or as sustenance is a fading memory.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Some of the region’s best-known examples are Parma’s <span class="italic">Felino</span>, with its own DOC, or controlled area of production; Ferrara’s garlic-flavored zantil (also known as <span class="italic">gentile</span>); and the rare <span class="italic">salame d’oca</span>, goose meat scented with clove, a remnant of Ferrara’s large Jewish community. West of Ferrara province, Romagna produces another gentile, seasoned with salt and pepper. Connoisseurs claim that garlic in this gentile is a sign of sloppy craftsmanship. Salame Piacentina of Piacenza is spiced with a secret blend that always suggests clove, cinnamon, and garlic to me. The Po delta is proud of its plump balls of red-wine-and-garlic-flavored <span class="italic">la bondiola</span>, which are often encased in well-washed turkey crops or pigs’ bladders and smoked in the big chimneys of delta homes.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">Salume</span></p>
<p class="chapterHeadB" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Cured Pork</span></span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">What <span class="italic">charcuterie</span> is in France, <span class="italic">salume</span> is in Italy. This general term describes all preserved or cured pork products, like prosciutto, salami, coppa, and pancetta. <span class="italic">Salume</span> derives from <span class="italic">sale</span>, or salt, the primary ingredient in any recipe for preserving pork. Salume is sold in a <span class="italic">salumeria</span>, or pork store, where sausages, mortadelle, hams, and salami hang over counters like great stalactites.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Emilia-Romagna’s salume is held in high regard throughout Italy. The region’s fine cured pork products began long ago when Emilia-Romagna’s exceptionally fertile land created lush foraging for the wild pigs that predated any domesticated animals. During the Roman period, salted wild <a id="page504"/>boar from Emilia-Romagna rivaled the best cured meats from throughout the Empire.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">As agriculture and domestication took hold, preserving a pig to last through the year became a form of artisanship. Sheep and goats were as economical to keep as the pig (the cow required expensive grazing land, so it was not as popular) but lacked the sweet-tasting fat that gave pork such succulence. It was fat that kept the meat moist and palatable even when the sometimes crude salting methods produced meat so salty that it was barely edible. And pigs grew fatter in Emilia-Romagna than in most other parts of Italy. Until the late 1940s, for many Emilia-Romagna families survival often depended on the successful curing of each and every part of the animal, so that there would always be at least a little meat or fat to eat.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">There is a rhythm to salume that is deeply ingrained in the culture of Emilia-Romagna. It begins with the ritual winter slaughter of the pig and builds through the year as each part becomes ready to eat.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">According to Gianni Quondamatteo, chronicler of Romagnolo foodways, in Romagna, slaughter must take place between Saint Andrea’s Day, November 30, and January 17, the day of Saint Antonio Abate.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Quondamatteo explains how the pig joins with the life of the peasants and farmers in <span class="italic">le nozze del porco</span>, “the wedding of the pig.” This is the 8- to 10-day period when all of the animal is cured and “married” into the natural and ancient rhythms of gathering food, preserving it for winter, and taking nourishment and sustenance from it. In the process the pig gives itself entirely to the people, wedding them symbolically, and in this, literally sustaining them through the year. At the end of each day of work, families gather to celebrate the “wedding” with fresh sausages, blood puddings and even fresh roasted meat—a great luxury years ago.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Whether in Emilia or Romagna, the first parts of the pig ready for eating are the fresh sausage, the lard (<span class="italic">strutto</span>), and the <span class="italic">ciccioli</span> (hard pork fat cooked down into golden shales that are crunchy and savory). The marriage continues with any number of interpretations of cotechino and zampone, ready after a week or so. Within several months pancette (salted cheeks and bacon) and salami finish curing. Depending on their density, some salami cure even longer. After 6 months the coppe are ready and the spalla (shoulder) can be eaten. At about 11 months the most prized piece, the prosciutto, will be cut. And then it is time for another <span class="italic">nozze del porco</span>.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">Spalla di San Secondo</span></p>
<p class="chapterHeadB" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Cured Pork Shoulder from San Secondo</span></span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">This specialty from the Parma plain around the little town of San Secondo is a boned pork shoulder (<span class="italic">spalla</span>) cured in salted white wine, with some producers adding pepper, cinnamon, and sodium nitrate. Once it is stuffed into a large casing, the spalla resembles an oversized pear. Spalla is always poached or steamed before being eaten as an antipasto. Its flavor reminds me of corned beef.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Part of spalla di San Secondo’s appeal in Emilia-Romagna is its connection to the much-loved composer Giuseppe Verdi, who was born and lived much of his life near San Secondo. He relished spalla and supposedly left oft-quoted directions for soaking, poaching and serving it.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">What is thought to be Verdi’s own recipe for curing this speciality was passed from his gardener’s son to Giovanni Tamburini, owner of Tamburini, Bologna’s lavish food emporium. There was quite a stir on the day the first <span class="italic">spalla di Verdi</span> was tasted back in 1986. Everyone agreed it was one of the best they had eaten, even if it did contain a little too much salt. Today spalla di San Secondo is still made only around the town in Parma province and at Tamburini in Bologna. It is not exported to the United States.</p>

<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Selecting and Using Tomatoes</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Fresh Tomatoes:</span> When you find a vine-ripened tomato so good you want to eat it like an apple, you have discovered the intense lushness that characterizes much of Emilia-Romagna’s tomatoes. This is the sort of tomato that regional cooks merely warm in a little butter or oil with a few leaves of fresh herbs and then toss with pasta. The fruit’s joyous flavor explodes on the palate.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Haunt farmers’ markets and organic and heirloom vegetable vendors for this kind of quality. Taste before you buy. The fact that a tomato is vine ripened does not necessarily mean the flavor is wonderful. Great-tasting tomatoes are often older varieties, with skins too thin to ship thousands of miles and eccentric growing habits that do not encourage mass production. They are out there, however, and in season you should accept nothing less.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">The Peel and Seed Question:</span> Interestingly, peeling is rarely mentioned in old Italian cookbooks. Certainly peeling is not always necessary today, especially when a recipe is a country dish in which skins would add texture, or when the mixture will be passed through a food mill. Perhaps peeling is required in modern dishes because the newer tomato varieties have thicker skins, developed for long-distance shipping.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">To seed or not to seed is a personal and textural preference. A tomato high in acid or unbalanced in flavor will be bitter with or without seeds and skin.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">To peel a tomato, blister it over a gas burner, grill, or under the broiler rather than dropping it in boiling water. Water dilutes the flavor, whereas quick searing intensifies it. Use a long fork to hold the fruit over the heat, and blister the skin quickly without cooking the tomato. Then let the tomato cool for a few seconds and slip off the skin. If peeling many tomatoes, arrange them on your oven’s broiler pan and sear them as close to the broiler as possible.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Canned Tomatoes:</span> Canned tomatoes are my first choice when the only fresh ones available are the American winter tomatoes.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Italy’s San Marzano or San Marzano—type canned tomatoes do not always possess superior flavor. Quality varies with alarming unevenness from one imported brand to the next. Often a domestic brand is better.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Recommending specific brands is difficult, since the selection varies greatly from one part of the country to the next. Try a tomato tasting with some similarly minded friends. Collect all the brands of canned tomatoes available in your area, and sample them for deep, rich tomato character with enough acid to set off the ripe sweet flavors. Make a big pot of tomato soup as the finale.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Cooking with Canned Tomatoes:</span> For recipes in this book calling for canned tomatoes, use peeled whole plum or round tomatoes. Do not use crushed, ground, or puréed tomatoes. They lack the clean, light quality of whole canned ones and they usually are heavily dosed with thick purée, which intensifies strong acid flavors.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Tomato Paste:</span> Tubes of imported tomato paste (ideally from Parma) do get my vote over the domestic canned variety. The concentration is often stronger, so the flavor is rounder and deeper.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Tubes also win over cans for convenience. Everyone has had the experience of opening a can of tomato paste in order to use 1 tablespoon and then finding it has turned into something resembling a laboratory experiment after a couple of weeks in the refrigerator. Refrigerated tubes will hold for 4 to 5 weeks with no spoilage.</p>
<a id="page506"/>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">The Tomato in Emilia-Romagna</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Although most of us think of Italy’s tomato canning industry as being concentrated in the south, Parma is a major northern center, especially for tomato paste. Why Parma? Ideal climate is one important factor, and old alliances may be another.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">According to Parma historian and linguistic authority Professor Guglielmo Capacchi, it is likely that Parma’s first tomatoes arrived from France during the late 1700s along with a glittering contingent from the Bourbon court of Louis XV. Capacchi also points out that earlier writings mention the <span class="italic">tomacle</span> being offered with maccheroni during the mid-1500s on the Po plain.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The widespread pairing of tomato and pasta was still 300 years away. But Spain (which brought the tomato from the Americas) had spread the fruit to her large holdings in southern Italy, where it was being eaten, with some hesitancy, by the 1600s. Parma’s strong alliance with Spain at that time makes it easy to create an unrecorded historical scenario: A Spanish ambassador presents the Duke of Parma with a basket of this bright red curiosity from the New World. The Duke politely takes a bite, likes it, and the tomato is initiated into Parma cuisine. Highly unlikely. But what is likely is that the tomato may have been a botanical curiosity for a long time and then gradually gained acceptance as food.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Certainly by the early 19th century, when Marie Louise of Austria, wife of the exiled Napoleon, reigned as the Duchess of Parma, a collection of stuffed tomato recipes were part of the court cook’s repertoire. In 1887 Carlo Rognoni and Lodovico Pagani launched Parma’s commercial tomato production with their perfected Riccio strain, which is still the foundation of the area’s industry today.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">While the gentry were eating fresh and canned tomatoes, Emilia-Romagna’s peasants preserved the harvest by drying as well as bottling. Strings of dried tomatoes festooned the beams of country kitchens in the region.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Gianni Quondamatteo, historian of Romagna’s gastronomic past, claims that tomatoes gained popularity in Romagna only in the 1800s. Household lore dictated that flasks of preserved tomatoes be hung from rafters, and conserved tomatoes were always added to the liquid of the poaching Christmas capon.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The tiny dried tomatoes of Rimini were and still are thought to give noble dimension to broths. The area’s folklore claims tomato skins helped heal insect bites and keep away flies and mosquitoes. A nutritious tomato marmalade still strengthens babies and sufferers of anemia.</p>

<p class="chapterHeadB" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Sausage of Stuffed Pig’s Foot</span></span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Zampone is Modena’s most distinctive cured pork product. Coarsely ground pork, pork skin, and spices are blended and stuffed into the boned and cleaned front foot (<span class="italic">zampa</span>, the root of <span class="italic">zampone</span>, means “pig’s foot”). The sausage is lightly cured and then cooked. A good zampone makes your lips lusciously sticky with gelatinous juices, is pleasantly pebbly on the tongue, tastes of rich pork and mild spicing, and is an appealing dark amber.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Buying, Storing, and Using Zampone</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Zampone is produced in the United States mostly during the winter, especially at Christmas. Order it from Italian purveyors. Some producers encase the filling not in the foot but in rind from other parts of the pig and call it zampino.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Uncooked zampone holds well, unwrapped, in the refrigerator about 4 days. Cooked, it will keep 5 to 7 days. Check the producer’s directions for whether or not soaking is recommended before cooking. I prefer not to freeze zampone.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">See Second Courses for cooking directions. Leftover zampone slices make a robust, homey supper, simply reheated and sprinkled with balsamic vinegar. Or cut slices into small pieces, reheat them <a id="page507"/>with browned onions, and toss with a stubby maccheroni or maltagliati pasta and grated Parmigiano-Reggiano.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Cotechino can be used if zampone is unavailable.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadA" style="text-indent: 0%;">Zampone in Emilia-Romagna</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Modena’s passion for zampone, its famous hallmark sausage, knows no bounds. At the first chill of autumn, zampone makers set to work creating rotund clubs of sausage. They hang in amber-colored clusters, decorating shop windows and tempting passersby.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">One can be put off by a stuffed pig’s foot, but for the people of Modena there is not a second’s hesitation. Slices of zampone, hot and juicy from their cooking liquid, have been captivating hungry Modenese since at least the 1500s.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Modena’s zampone and cotechino, <span class="italic">cappello da prete</span> (priest’s hat), and <span class="italic">sassolino</span> (named for the village the sausage comes from) all share a similar stuffing and are always served hot. The Modenese say these sausages are a celebration of the pig with “a taste of everything.” The filling comes from many parts of the animal and no doubt originated as a way of using up what was left after curing larger, more desirable pieces of pork.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Combining meat from the shoulder, neck, shank, cheek, and sirloin creates rich flavor, as each part contributes its own character. Succulence and body come from a balance of lean with fat and a little gelatinous pork rind. Salt, pepper, nutmeg, clove, and cinnamon add subtle spicing.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Preparing zampone used to be a lengthy affair. It was heavily salted and needed long soaking. Then a cross-shaped incision was made in the side of the sausage. After wrapping it in a heavily oiled cloth, it was steamed for about 1½ hours per pound on a raised rack in a special oval casserole, the <span class="italic">zamponiera</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Today much less salt is used and some zampone are sold precooked, needing only reheating before serving.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Christmas, weddings, and parties without zampone are unthinkable. To leave zampone out of Modena’s traditional <span class="italic">Bollito Misto</span> (mixed poached meats) is heresy. When not part of the <span class="italic">Bollito</span>, with its capon, beef, calf’s head, and veal roast, zampone is sliced and served hot over mashed potatoes, accompanied by sautéed spinach, and moistened with balsamic vinegar or a green herb sauce. Modenese debate the authenticity of substituting lentils or braised white beans for the potatoes, a penchant of some local cooks.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="Images/507.jpg"/></p>
<p class="caption" style="text-indent:0%;">Old Modena postcard touting the town’s three main attractions—the Ghirlandina bell tower, Lambrusco wine and zampone sausage<br/> Il Collectionista, Milan</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Although the Modenese are sure zampone was born in their territory, no one has yet found solid documentation of exactly where and when. One legend has its creation set in 1511 at Mirandola, out on Modena’s plain. The town was under siege by Pope Giulio II. Starvation was a reasonable prospect. The few pigs left in town had been slaughtered. The question was, how to preserve the scraps of meat left after all the sausage casings had been used up? Why not cure it in its own skin? <a id="page508"/>This predecessor to zampone was called <span class="italic">manicotto</span>, meaning stuffed muff or sleeve.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Firm proof of zampone’s existence in the 1600s can be seen in a period painting showing the plumped pig’s feet being sold in Modena’s Piazza Grande. The same year the United States was born, Milan’s governor, Duke Francesco III, demanded that “twenty-four zampetti of the finest stuffing” be sent to him post haste. By the 19th century, Modena postcards illustrated the town’s three main tourist attractions: its famed cathedral tower, Lambrusco wine, and zampone. At the same time zampone was praised and sought by non-Modenese. Composer Gioacchino Antonio Rossini and Italy’s liberator, Garibaldi, both doted on it. The sausage was even sold in Paris, where Emile Zola called it “delicious and divine.”</p>
