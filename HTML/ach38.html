<p class="author1"><span class="txit">uova al pomodoro</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">As a kid I looked forward to this Friday night meal. Not only was it unusually beautiful, but its sweet flavor, thanks to the onions, would linger long after the last bite. This recipe uses a simple method of poaching the eggs in tomato sauce. It makes a terrific lunch dish, served with slices of bread for dipping in the sauce and accompanied by a tossed salad.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 small onion, thinly sliced</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup canned whole plum tomatoes</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 large eggs</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">Warm the olive oil in a medium-size nonstick frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes, crushing them with your hand or the back of a slotted spoon. Cook until the tomatoes have sweetened, about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Gently break the eggs into the pan and cover. Cook until the whites are opaque and the yolks are moderately firm, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately, seasoned with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

Warm the sauce over medium heat for 5 to 7 minutes before adding the eggs.</p>
<p class="noindenta">To make a heart-healthy and tasty version of this dish, follow the basic recipe but use 6 egg whites in place of the whole eggs.</p>
