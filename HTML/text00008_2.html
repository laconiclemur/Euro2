 pesce</h2>
<h2 class="h2a">fish and shellfish</h2>
<p class="parab1">Our house was set on a cliff edge, 30 metres above the sea. I was born there on a stormy night to the sound of crashing waves battering the windows. The sea was the first thing I ever heard and I fell in love with it there and then.</p>
<p class="parab1">I don’t remember learning to swim, it was just something I could always do. I used to swim in the sea every day as a child. I liked to pretend I was all alone on a desert island, running along the shore and screeching like Tarzan, or leaping through the waves like a dolphin and swimming around the bottom of the cliffs with the fish. I would have such arguments with the fish, diving under the water and chasing them around the rocks.</p>
<p class="parab1">The sea used to come alive with fish in the summer months. Octopus, red and grey mullet, sea bass, bream, groupers, scorpion fish – you name it. I went after them on boats, from the rocks, off the beach. I fished at night and during the day. I was encrusted with sea salt. Even now, if I put my tongue against my arm I can taste the salt.</p>
<p class="parab1">The sea was part of me and I mastered the art of reading it. It told me what the weather was going to be like, the best time to go fishing and where to find the finest fish. The secret nooks and crannies of the rocks were my private hunting ground. I improvised with my equipment: fashioning together a hook and line, making my own harpoons, or gathering up cast-off pieces of net from the fishermen. The route to the prime fishing spots was not easy, as the rocks were sharp and dangerous. I learned to scramble across craggy cliff faces and swim through underwater arches to get to my special fishing spots. When I caught some fish, I often built a small fire and cooked them there and then. My favourite was sardines cooked on a stick.</p>
<p class="parab1"><a id="page_72"></a>
 Sometimes I would collect mussels, limpets and sea urchins. The mussels were small but full of the tastiest meat imaginable, and delicious eaten raw with just a squeeze of lemon. The oysters were even better. To get to the best oysters I had to dive down about four or five metres. I learned to take a big breath and pinpoint exactly where they were, then dart through the water like a torpedo and snatch them off the seabed. I ate them straight away, fresh from the sea.</p>
<p class="parab1">I always took a lemon on my fishing excursions and it served many purposes apart from flavouring the fish I caught. It quenched my thirst when I was far away from fresh water and acted as a disinfectant if I scraped myself on the rocks. To this day, I always carry a lemon with me. My mother used to tell me that every slice of lemon would give you an extra year of life.</p>
<p class="parab1">The sea was crystal clear in those coves, and you could see hundreds of small, colourful shrimps darting through the shallow water. These couldn’t be caught with a simple hook or net. Instead, I had to make a special trap from very fine net and a ring of metal. It was hard work lying on my front and scooping the tiny shrimps out of the water, but it was worth it because they were extraordinarily sweet to eat and people paid good money for them.</p>

 insalata di merluzzo con fagiolini e salsa verde</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">hake salad with green beans and salsa verde</h3>
<p class="para1">A wonderfully delicate fish, hake tends to be undervalued in the UK, although I believe it has experienced a revival lately. It is eaten a lot in Italy, especially in the South, and in other Mediterranean countries. If you can’t find hake, you could replace it with cod. The combination of delicate fish, crunchy vegetables and tangy salsa verde is really delicious. <em>Salsa verde</em>
 is Italian for ‘green sauce’, and traditionally used to flavour steamed fish or boiled meats and sausages. If you double or triple the quantities, you can store it in the fridge for up to seven days and use it to liven up meals during the week.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">2 turnips, cut in half and sliced</p>
<p class="ingre">4 large, flat green beans (such as runner beans or mangetout), sliced on the diagonal into 2cm/¾in lengths</p>
<p class="ingre">100g/4oz fine green beans, trimmed</p>
<p class="ingre">1 fennel bulb, outer layers removed, heart thinly sliced</p>
<p class="ingre">500g/1lb 2oz whole hake or 400g/14oz hake fillet</p>
<p class="ingre">lemon wedges, to serve (optional)</p>
<p class="ingre">
<strong>for the salsa verde:</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">a bunch of fresh parsley</p>
<p class="ingre">25 fresh mint leaves</p>
<p class="ingre">3 anchovy fillets</p>
<p class="ingre">1 tbsp capers</p>
<p class="ingre">1 garlic clove, peeled</p>
<p class="ingre">3 cocktail gherkins (cornichons)</p>
<p class="ingre">6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">1 tbsp lemon juice</p>
<p class="ingre1">1 small tsp English mustard</p>
<p class="para1">Cook the turnips, large beans and fine beans in a large saucepan of boiling water until tender. Lift out with a slotted spoon and set aside to cool. Blanch the fennel in the same water for 1 minute, then lift out and set aside to cool. Cook the hake in the same water as the vegetables. If you are using a whole piece of hake, this will take 10 minutes; if you are using hake fillet, this will take 5 minutes. Drain the fish and leave to cool, then remove and discard all the bones and the skin. Break the fish into large chunks and set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">To make the salsa verde, chop the parsley and mint very finely on a chopping board with a mezzaluna, if you have one. On the same board, chop the anchovy fillets, capers, garlic and gherkins, gradually mixing and chopping all the ingredients together very finely. You could do this in a food processor but I prefer to do it by hand, as you get more texture. Place in a bowl, add the olive oil, lemon juice and mustard and mix well.</p>
<p class="para1">Arrange the fish chunks and vegetables on a large serving dish or individual plates and drizzle the salsa verde over the top. Serve with lemon wedges, if desired.</p>

 carpaccio di trota</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">raw marinated trout</h3>
<p class="para1">England and the English were romantic visions of my childhood. I used to dream of dressing as an elegant English gentleman – and fishing for trout in my elegant clothes amid the glorious English countryside. I had heard many stories about fly-fishing and, desperate to try it out, I once spent a whole afternoon catching flies and sticking them on to my hook and line. I don’t need to tell you that it was a complete failure.</p>
<p class="para1">When I moved to England, I was introduced to the secrets of real fly-fishing. I fulfilled my childhood dream and became a master trout fisherman. Winning the prize for the biggest trout in Walthamstow may not sound very romantic but it was one of my proudest moments.</p>

<p class="para1">Arrange a few baby salad leaves on 4 serving plates, followed by some fennel, and top with the marinated trout. Beat the leftover dressing and drizzle over the top. Serve immediately.</p>

 ippoglosso con capperi e dragoncello</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">halibut with caper and dill sauce</h3>
<p class="para1">I discovered halibut when I came to England. I loved its light, delicate flavour immediately and it has become one of my favourite fish. I have included two recipes for it in this book: here it is served with a simple green sauce, which gives it a Mediterranean flavour. Serve with boiled new potatoes.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">4 pieces of halibut fillet, weighing about 200g/7oz each</p>
<p class="ingre">juice of 2 lemons</p>
<p class="ingre">4 tbsp olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">salt</p>

<p class="ingre">6 tbsp capers</p>
<p class="ingre">1 garlic clove, peeled</p>
<p class="ingre">4 anchovy fillets</p>
<p class="ingre">a handful of fresh parsley</p>
<p class="ingre">a large bunch of fresh dill</p>
<p class="ingre">2 tbsp finely grated lemon zest</p>
<p class="ingre1">120ml/4fl oz extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="para1">Score the halibut skin with a sharp knife, then place the fillets in a bowl and pour over the lemon juice. Leave to marinate for about 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="para1">Make the sauce. Place the capers on a chopping board and squash them slightly with the flat of a knife blade. Place the garlic, anchovy fillets, parsley and dill on the same board and chop all the ingredients very finely, mixing together as you do so. Place in a bowl and mix with the lemon zest and extra virgin olive oil. Set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">Remove the halibut from the marinade, pat dry with kitchen paper and season with a little salt. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan and cook the fish skin-side down for 3–4 minutes, covering it with a lid to prevent the oil splashing everywhere. Turn the fish over and cook the other side, covered, for 3 minutes. About a minute before the end of the cooking time, uncover the pan and spread a little of the sauce over the top of the halibut.</p>
<p class="para1">Place a spoonful of the remaining sauce on each serving plate, place the fish on top and serve immediately.</p>

<p class="para1">Melt 75g/3oz of the butter in a large frying pan (keep the heat gentle, as it is easy to burn butter), add the halibut and cook for 3–4 minutes on each side. Then increase the heat, pour in the lemon juice from the marinade and allow to bubble and evaporate slightly. Add the remaining butter; the sauce will thicken. Serve immediately.</p>

 orata in aqua pazza</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">whole sea bream cooked with cherry tomatoes</h3>
<p class="para1">This dish is very typical of all southern Italian coastal regions. Freshly caught sea bream, fresh tomatoes, basil, extra virgin olive oil and garlic – it encompasses the taste of the sea and the flavours of the South. It is an extremely simple dish to prepare and, provided you have the freshest ingredients and good-quality extra virgin olive oil, you can’t go wrong. Even if you live in the city and make this dish on a grey miserable day, it will give you the feeling of being by the sea in the warm southern sunshine.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">175ml/6fl oz extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">2 sea bream, weighing about 500g/1lb 2oz each, cleaned and scaled</p>
<p class="ingre">4 garlic cloves, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">20 cherry tomatoes, quartered</p>
<p class="ingre">a handful of fresh basil leaves, plus extra to garnish</p>
<p class="ingre">1 small red chilli, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">salt, to taste</p>
<p class="ingre1">400ml/14fl oz water</p>
<p class="para1">Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy-based frying pan over a fairly high heat. Add the bream, followed by the garlic, tomatoes, basil, chilli and some salt. Pour in the water, turn the heat down slightly and cook the fish for 7 minutes on each side. When you flip the fish over, you will know that it is done if the eye has turned white.</p>
<p class="para1">Remove the fish from the pan and place on a large serving dish. Turn up the heat, cook the sauce for 30 seconds to concentrate the flavours slightly, and then pour it over the fish. Serve immediately, garnished with basil leaves and with lots of good bread to mop up the delicious sauce.</p>

 orata all’agrodolce</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">sea bream fillets in a honey and white wine vinegar sauce</h3>
<p class="para1">Sea bream is one of my favourite fish and I used to catch lots of them in Italy. The sweet and sour combination of the honey and wine vinegar works extremely well with the chicory and delicate flavour sea bream. Just make sure you have three pans – one for the chicory, one for the sauce and one for the fish. Try this dish for a dinner party; it’s bound to impress your guests!</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">4 sea bream fillets</p>
<p class="ingre">6 heads of chicory</p>

<p class="ingre">220ml/7½fl oz white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="ingre1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1">Score the skin of each sea bream fillet 3 or 4 times with a sharp knife. Season the flesh side with salt and pepper, then set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">Cut each chicory head in half lengthways, discard the small, hard central piece, then cut the chicory into cubes. Heat half the olive oil in a frying pan, add the chicory and sauté over a medium heat for 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper, add the water and cook until the liquid evaporates and the chicory has softened but is still a little crunchy. Set aside and keep warm.</p>
<p class="para1">Put the honey, butter and vinegar in another pan over a gentle heat. When the butter has melted, gently simmer the sauce for about 10 minutes, until it thickens to a syrupy consistency and turns golden brown.</p>
<p class="para1">Meanwhile, heat the remaining olive oil in a large frying pan, add the sea bream fillets, skin-side down, and cook for about 3 minutes, pressing down on them with a wooden spatula so the fish doesn’t curl up. Flip the fillets over and cook the flesh side for another 3 minutes.</p>
<p class="para1">Arrange the chicory on a large serving dish or 4 individual plates and place the fish on top. Pour the sauce over and serve immediately.</p>

 involtini di pesce spada con finocchio</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">rolled swordfish fillet with fennel</h3>
<p class="para1">The filling in this recipe has quite a strong flavour and I find it goes really well with the meaty texture of swordfish. Blanched fennel and onion give the dish a freshness and crunchiness. It all takes a little time to prepare but it is simple to make and the results are stunning. I would make it for a special dinner. Ask your fishmonger for loin of swordfish, which you can either take home and slice yourself or get him to slice for you.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">500g/1lb 2oz swordfish loin, cut into 8 thin slices</p>
<p class="ingre">6 tbsp olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">2 fennel bulbs, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="ingre">2 onions, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="ingre">extra virgin olive oil and lemon juice for drizzling</p>
<p class="ingre">a little grated lemon zest to serve</p>
<p class="ingre">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingre">
<strong>for the filling:</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">100g/4oz fresh breadcrumbs</p>
<p class="ingre">2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">20 large capers in brine, drained</p>
<p class="ingre">4 anchovy fillets in olive oil, drained</p>
<p class="ingre">1 small garlic clove</p>
<p class="ingre">a handful of fresh parsley leaves</p>
<p class="ingre">a handful of fresh mint leaves</p>
<p class="ingre">4 tsp grated lemon zest</p>
<p class="ingre1">freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1">Place all the ingredients for the filling in a food processor and whiz until mushy. Take handfuls of the mixture and make 8 rough sausage shapes with it, then set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">Place the swordfish slices in between cling film and gently flatten with a meat mallet or a rolling pin and season with salt and pepper, if desired (bearing in mind that the filling is quite salty). Place a piece of filling on each slice of swordfish; don’t worry if the filling comes apart slightly – just keep gently pressing it together with your fingers. Roll the fish up and secure with toothpicks, ensuring the sides are closed.</p>
<p class="para1">Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan, add the swordfish rolls, seam-side down, and fry for about 1 minute, until golden brown. Turn over and cook the other side until golden brown.</p>
<p class="para1">Meanwhile, blanch the fennel and onions for 30 seconds, drain well and place on a large serving dish. Arrange the cooked swordfish on top and drizzle with some extra virgin olive oil and a little lemon juice. Scatter over some lemon zest and serve immediately.</p>

 branzino con salsa alla rucola</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">sea bass with rocket</h3>
<p class="para1">Sea bass is another of my favourite fish and is very popular on the southern shores of my home in Italy – certainly a fish I would often catch. It has a lovely, delicate flavour and deserves a delicate sauce to go with it, such as this one made with rocket. Wild rocket has a much stronger flavour, so I leave it to you whether you prefer to use that or the milder, cultivated variety. If you have some sauce left over, or make extra, add a couple of tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil to it to make rocket pesto and use to flavour pasta as an alternative to the usual basil pesto.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">4 sea bass fillets</p>
<p class="ingre">2 tbsp olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">25g/1oz butter</p>
<p class="ingre">4 tbsp white wine</p>
<p class="ingre">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingre">
<strong>for the sauce:</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">1 tbsp butter</p>
<p class="ingre">3 anchovy fillets</p>
<p class="ingre">2 shallots, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">1 medium courgette, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">300ml/½ pint vegetable stock</p>
<p class="ingre1">200g/7oz rocket, roughly chopped, plus a few handfuls of rocket to serve</p>
<p class="para1">First make the sauce. Heat the olive oil and butter in a pan, add the anchovy fillets and cook, stirring over a gentle heat, until they have almost dissolved into the oil. Add the shallots and courgette and cook until the shallots begin to soften, then add the stock, bring to the boil and simmer for 1 minute. Stir in the rocket, season with black pepper and simmer for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, allow to cool slightly, then whiz in a blender or food processor until smooth. Return to the pan and stir over a high seat with a wooden spoon until nearly all the liquid has evaporated and the sauce becomes creamy. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">Season the sea bass with salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil and butter in a large frying pan, add the sea bass, flesh-side down, and cook over a medium heat for about 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Turn over and cook for another 3 minutes. Turn over again and gently peel off the skin. Add the wine, cover with a lid and cook for a few seconds. Uncover the pan, turn the fillets over, cover again and cook until the wine evaporates.</p>
<p class="para1">Meanwhile, reheat the sauce gently if necessary. Arrange some rocket on a plate, top with the sea bass fillets and pour the sauce either over the fish or on the side, as you wish.</p>

 polipo in umido</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">stewed octopus</h3>
<p class="para1">I used to love catching octopus when I lived in Italy, and even more so taking it home for my father to cook. It’s a shame they are not popular in Britain, as the sea here is full of them, but it seems they are caught and exported. A great pity, because they really are delicious, either stewed and served warm as in this recipe or dressed with olive oil and lemon to make a salad. I think a lot of people expect octopus to be chewy and tough, hence its unpopularity. The secret of tender octopus is to cook it without adding any liquid, as it exudes a lot of its own. (There is an Italian saying, ‘You are like an octopus, go cook in your own juice.’) The only liquid allowed is some olive oil to prevent it sticking to the pan. Follow this recipe and you will see how tender octopus can be – it should melt in your mouth.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">4 tbsp olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">3 garlic cloves, sliced</p>
<p class="ingre">1 tsp capers</p>

<p class="ingre">10 cherry tomatoes, squashed</p>
<p class="ingre">a handful of fresh parsley, coarse stalks removed</p>
<p class="ingre1">salt</p>
<p class="para1">Heat the olive oil in a small saucepan (use one in which the octopus will fit tightly) and add the garlic, capers, olives and anchovies. Once the garlic begins to sweat, add the octopuses and a pinch of salt. Stir well, lower the heat, then add the tomatoes and parsley. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and cook over a low heat for 1 hour and 10 minutes, until the octopuses are very tender. During cooking they will shrink and exude quite a bit of liquid. Adjust the seasoning if necessary, then serve.</p>

 cozze ‘scappate’</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">stuffed mussels with tomato sauce</h3>
<p class="para1">Because I lived by the sea, mussels were part of my life, and as a child I would pick bucketfuls of them during the cooler autumn months. When we had larger mussels, my father would often make this dish by removing the mussels from their shells, mixing them with stale bread, garlic and parsley and then stuffing the shells with this mixture. Using mussels in this way made an unusual, tasty dish and also meant they would go further to feed a large family. If you like mussels, try this dish for an informal supper with friends; it’s fun to eat, as you have to remove the raffia tied round each mussel.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">12 large mussels</p>
<p class="ingre">4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">4 anchovy fillets</p>
<p class="ingre">1 garlic clove, thinly sliced lengthways</p>
<p class="ingre">½ small red chilli, finely chopped (optional)</p>
<p class="ingre">20 capers</p>
<p class="ingre">3 tbsp white wine</p>
<p class="ingre">a handful of fresh parsley, finely chopped, plus a few sprigs to garnish</p>
<p class="ingre1">100g/4oz stale bread, cut into small cubes</p>
<p class="ingre">
<strong>for the sauce:</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">½ small onion, very finely diced</p>
<p class="ingre">½ tsp dried oregano</p>
<p class="ingre">2 large green olives, pitted and sliced</p>
<p class="ingre">400g/14oz tinned chopped tomatoes</p>
<p class="ingre1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1">Clean the mussels in plenty of cold water, scrubbing them well and pulling off the beards. Place in a pan, cover and steam for 2–3 minutes until the shells open. Remove from the heat and discard any mussels that are still closed. Remove the flesh from the shells and any liquid and place in a bowl (if necessary, open up the shells a little more, taking care to keep the shells intact). Keep the empty shells for later.</p>
<p class="para1">Heat the olive oil in a pan, add the anchovies and stir with a wooden spoon until they have almost dissolved into the oil. Add the garlic, chilli if using, and capers. Once the garlic turns golden, stir in the mussels, reserving their liquid for later. Heat the mussels through, then add the wine and simmer gently for 1 minute. Pour in the liquid from the mussels and stir in the parsley. Remove from the heat, mix in the bread cubes, then leave to cool. When the mixture has cooled, place it on a chopping board and chop quite finely with a sharp knife. Transfer to a bowl and mix well until you get a mushy consistency.</p>
<p class="para1">Dry the mussel shells and generously fill one half of each shell with the mussel mixture. Close the shell, removing any excess filling that escapes, and wrap some raffia around the middle of the shell, tying it round a few times until nice and tight, so the shell cannot open (you could use string, but I think raffia looks much nicer). Trim off any excess raffia and put the filled shells to one side.</p>
<p class="para1">To make the sauce, heat the olive oil in a large pan, add the onion and, as soon as it begins to fry, add the oregano, olives and tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper and bring to a gentle simmer. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the mussels to the sauce, cover the pan and cook gently for 20 minutes, turning the mussels over halfway through the cooking time. Stir from time to time and, if necessary, add some water to prevent the sauce becoming too dry. Put the filled mussel shells on individual plates, pour a little sauce over and garnish with a sprig of parsley. Serve immediately and remember to provide finger bowls for your guests.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Variation: Baked Stuffed Mussels</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">This is an alternative recipe, in which the mussels are baked and the tomato sauce omitted. Remove the mussels from their shells and prepare the filling as for <em>Cozze ‘Scappate’</em>
 (see above). Then fill both sides of each empty shell with the mussel mixture. Keep the shells open and place on a baking tray. Mix together a handful of breadcrumbs, a handful of parsley, finely chopped, and enough extra virgin olive oil just to moisten. Sprinkle this mixture over the open mussels. Place in an oven preheated to 200°C/400°F/Gas Mark 6 and bake for 15 minutes or until golden brown. Top each mussel with an anchovy fillet and a chopped green olive, drizzle over some extra virgin olive oil and serve with a few green salad leaves. This makes an excellent starter for a dinner party.</p>

 As with any love affair, I did have a few rough times with the sea. When I was about 13, I put to sea with a friend for an evening jaunt in my dinghy. We were having so much fun that we didn’t notice the wind blowing us further and further from the safety of the shore. We tried to get back but the current was too strong. The people on the beach didn’t take much notice of us. When we shouted, they thought we were just a pair of mischievous boys messing around. The truth was, we were stuck.</p>
<p class="paraba1">As it grew dark, we began to get really frightened. The sea was still and the lights of the town were visible for a long time, which kept us calm. But all too soon, they disappeared. I felt the bile of panic rising in my gullet. We imagined we were miles away, and talked about ending up in Africa and never seeing home again. Our young imaginations ran wild, turning the murmuring wind into the whisper of dead sailors, the booming of the ocean into sinister creatures trying to dash our flimsy vessel. We cried like babies as we bobbed around helplessly all night long.</p>
<p class="paraba1">The next morning a police boat found us. When we caught sight of it we started to scream with joy. It was part of a search party out looking for us. We were both severely reprimanded, then they took us home – it only took an hour to get back to shore, so we hadn’t gone far at all. I was banned from going on a boat again for a very long time, and my dinghy was destroyed. To keep our dignity, we made up stories of our adventures for our friends – the giant fish we had seen and the dolphins that had saved us.<span class="big1">’</span>

 gamberoni e granchio con aglio e peperoncino</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">king prawns and crab with garlic and chilli</h3>
<p class="para1">Always use fresh seafood for this dish. Prawns and crab make a great combination but if you prefer not to use crab, just substitute extra prawns. If you find it difficult to extract the crab meat from its shell, ask your fishmonger to do it for you.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">2 large fresh crabs (ask your fishmonger to prepare for you and reserve the shells)</p>
<p class="ingre">175ml/6fl oz extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">12 fresh raw king prawns, shell on</p>
<p class="ingre">4 garlic cloves, sliced lengthways</p>
<p class="ingre">2 red chillies, sliced lengthways into strips</p>
<p class="ingre">2 handfuls of fresh parsley leaves</p>
<p class="ingre">250ml/8fl oz white wine</p>
<p class="ingre">1 lemon, cut into quarters, to serve</p>
<p class="ingre">slices of bread, to serve</p>
<p class="ingre1">salt</p>
<p class="para1">Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan, add the prawns and cook for 1 minute over a high heat. Turn them over and cook the other side for another minute. Add the garlic, chillies and crab chunks, season with salt, then reduce the heat and cook for 2 minutes with the lid on. Add the parsley, increase the heat and pour in the wine and any reserved juices from the crab. Bubble until evaporated, then serve immediately, with lemon quarters and lots of bread to mop up the juices.</p>

 Minori was a fishing village. I used to hang around the fishermen when they came back with their catches, learning from them, teasing them and probably driving them crazy.</p>
<p class="paraba1">Every afternoon my friends and I waited on the beach for the fishermen to return from their trips. Quite often they would bring ashore a mighty turtle, which they had untangled from their nets. The poor creature would be half dead and brought back as a novelty. They may have caught it a few days earlier but they would have tied it to the back of the boat and dragged it to shore as a trophy. Sometimes the well-travelled sailors would take the turtles home to eat, and many people used their shells to decorate their houses. I never liked this. I knew instinctively that these beasts needed protecting.</p>
<p class="paraba1">One day I was alone on the beach when one of the fishing boats returned with a turtle in a poor state, but still alive. I asked the fishermen if I could have it and, using all my strength, I dragged the half-dead beast back into the sea and round to a small cove away from the main beach. I stayed with her all afternoon, willing her to recover her strength. At night I found a rope and tied her to a rock in the cover. The next morning, when I rushed down to check on her, I found to my joy that she was full of life and spirit, flapping around to try and free herself. I cut the rope and watched her swim away effortlessly.</p>
<p class="paraba1">After that, the turtles became my mission. Every time a fisherman brought one ashore, I would try to save it, though usually without as much success. To my relief, the fishermen soon began to understand that the turtles were special and stopped bringing them home.<span class="big1">’</span>

 pesce conservato</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">preserved fish</h3>
<p class="para1">Preserving fish is an old tradition and, although its original purpose was to deal with a large catch, preserved fish is still eaten today as a delicacy rather than out of necessity. Here are some of the most popular preserved fish used in Italian cooking.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Acciughe</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">You can buy anchovies preserved in either oil or salt. For both types, fresh anchovies are gutted, layered with sea salt and left for about a month. They are then filleted and packed in jars or rinsed of the salt and placed in jars or tins with olive or vegetable oil. See <a href="text00004.html#page_12">here</a>
 for tips on using anchovies in cooking.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Baccalá</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">This is cod preserved in salt. It was traditionally known as ‘poor food’, and was eaten by people who lived inland and did not have access to the sea. Cod was the cheapest fish available and was preserved in large quantities, then kept in the store cupboard. However, it has become quite fashionable these days and commands a high price.</p>
<p class="para1">You can buy baccalá in pieces, which need to be soaked in several changes of fresh water for at least 24 hours before use, thereby removing the salt and softening the flesh. In some areas of Italy, such as Liguria, Venice and Naples, baccalá is very prominent on the menu. It is delicious steamed or boiled, then simply dressed with some extra virgin olive oil and lemon juice, eaten warm or cold as a salad, or cooked in a tomato sauce with black olives. It also makes delicious fish cakes and fritters.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Bottarga</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">This is cured roe of grey mullet and tuna, produced and consumed mainly in Sicily and Sardinia. It can be used like <em>mosciame</em>
 (see below), but is more commonly grated over seafood pasta dishes. You can find it in good Italian delicatessens.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Mosciame</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">This air-dried fillet of tuna has become quite a delicacy on many menus. It is available in Italian or Spanish delicatessens. Serve thinly sliced, drizzled with some extra virgin olive oil and lemon juice and accompanied by <a href="text00010.html#page_138">preserved vegetables</a>
 as an alternate antipasto to cured meats.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Pesce affumicato</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">Smoked fish is becoming increasingly popular in Italy and swordfish, tuna, halibut and sturgeon are just some of the varieties available. Arrange an assortment of thinly sliced smoked fish on a large plate, drizzle with lemon juice and serve with mixed baby salad leaves and rocket for an antipasto or light lunch.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Stoccafisso</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">This is air-dried cod. It is sold whole and should be soaked in several changes of fresh water for about 24 hours before use. It also helps to tenderise it if you bash it with a mallet before soaking. Cook it in the same way as <em>baccalá</em>
 (see above).</p>
