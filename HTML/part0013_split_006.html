  <h3 class="h3a">Rosemary bread rolls</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">Lovely bread rolls enhanced by the addition of rosemary make a welcome appearance in any bread basket. Delicious served with an antipasto of cured meats and preserved vegetables or simply as a snack on their own or with some creamy ricotta cheese. If you prefer, the rosemary can be replaced with black olives or, for a more pungent flavour, anchovy fillets – or a combination of all three – but if using anchovies you won’t need to add the coarse sea salt.</p>

  <p class="ing">Makes 12 rolls</p>

  <p class="ing1">500g/1lb 2oz/4 cups ‘00’ flour</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 x 7g sachet of dried yeast</p>

  <p class="ing1">7g salt</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra to rub</p>

  <p class="ing1">250ml/9fl oz/1 cup lukewarm water</p>

  <p class="ing1">needles from 4 sprigs of rosemary</p>

  <p class="ing2">a handful of coarse sea salt</p>

  <p class="para">In a large bowl, combine the flour, yeast and salt. Add the olive oil and gradually mix in the water to form a dough. Knead on a lightly floured surface for 10 minutes, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until it has doubled in size.</p>

  <p class="para">Using your hands, roll the dough into a long sausage shape about 2cm/¾ inch thick – it may be easier to divide the dough in two or three pieces before rolling. Rub a little olive oil all over, sprinkle with rosemary and sea salt, slice into sausage shapes about 20cm/8 inches long and wrap round into a coil. Press lightly with the palm of your hand and place the rolls on a baking sheet, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rise for 1 hour.</p>

  <p class="para1">Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6. Bake for 15–20 minutes, until golden. Cool on a wire rack.</p>
