<p class="summary"><span class="bi">Within Spain, Catalonia and the rest of the Mediterranean coast</span> are considered the “zone of sauces.” These are cold sauces and dressings that make fabulous accompaniments to all kinds of dishes, especially meats, fish, and cooked vegetables. With their subtle or strong flavors, they lift the poached or grilled foods people like to make in hot weather. They also create an exciting spectacle for the table, in little bowls to pass around, with their bright or gentle colors. Green salads are simply dressed with extra virgin olive oil and lemon juice or vinegar, but other more substantial salads are dressed with <span class="italic">vinagretas</span> embellished with tiny bits of chopped ingredients, such as tomatoes, herbs, capers, olives, onions, and hard-boiled eggs. <span class="italic">Vinagretas</span> are less vinegary than the vinaigrettes of France. Spain now produces a wide variety of superb extra virgin olive oils (see page 229) and wine and cider vinegars (see page 136) that are well worth discovering.</p>
<p class="summary">The people of the island of Minorca claim that mayonnaise was born there, in the port town of Mahón, and that the original name was <span class="italic">mahonesa</span>. Their story is that it was adopted by the French after the Duke of Richelieu took the city from the English in 1756. The sauce has a huge importance in the cooking of Mediterranean Spain, where it appears in many guises and accompanies many dishes. Mayonnaise and <span class="italic">alioli</span> are eaten in other countries around the Mediterranean, but those of Catalonia are especially notable—there are different and unique versions, such as <span class="italic">alioli</span> with quinces, apples, or pears, or with honey. <span class="italic">Romesco,</span> Catalonia’s iconic nut sauce, named after a pepper, was born in Tarragona at the end of the nineteenth century, when it was called <span class="italic">salsa vermeilla</span> (red sauce)—it is orangy red from tomato and the red pepper.</p>
<p class="summary">The Canary Islands in the Atlantic off the coast of Morocco have a range of splendid sauces, several of them based on garlic, herbs, peppers, and olive oil, which they call <span class="italic">mojos</span>.</p>
<p class="summary">In Catalonia and northern Spain, there are a number of Spanish versions of béchamel sauce, several of which you will find within the recipes of this book, such as in ham croquettes (page 166), eggplant with béchamel and cheese (page 253), and fish and seafood in a saffron béchamel (page 337). The most symbolic Spanish sauce, though, is the fresh tomato sauce that became the signature tune of Mediterranean cooking (see page 145).</p>
