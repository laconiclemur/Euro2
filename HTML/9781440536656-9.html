				<p class="recipe-ingredients"><span><span class="fractions"><sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub></span> cup warm water</span></p>
				<p class="recipe-ingredients"><span>1<span class="fractions"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span> teaspoons olive oil</span></p>
				<p class="recipe-ingredients"><span><span class="fractions"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span> teaspoon salt</span></p>
				<p class="recipe-ingredients"><span>1<span class="fractions"><sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub></span> cups flour</span></p>
				<ol class="recipe">
					<li><p class="recipestep">Combine yeast with the warm water and stir. Add olive oil and salt and mix again. Add 1<span class="fractions"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub></span> cups flour and combine with a wooden spoon. Add another <span class="fractions"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub></span> cup flour and mix with hands to form dough.</p></li>
					<li><p class="recipestep">Knead dough on a floured board for 10 minutes, adding the remaining flour as needed to prevent sticking. (Use more flour if necessary to prevent sticking.)</p></li>
					<li><p class="recipestep">Let dough rise covered in an oiled bowl for 1<span class="fractions"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span> hours in a warm place. Punch down dough and divide it into six pieces. Roll them into balls with your hands, cover, and let rest 5 minutes.</p></li>
					<li><p class="recipestep">Roll the balls into 6-inch flat rounds on a floured board, cover, and let rest again for 15 minutes this time.</p></li>
					<li><p class="recipestep">Preheat the oven to 500°F and place 2 pitas on a baking sheet pan. Bake for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and take the baked pitas off and put 2 more on the hot pan. Bake them in the oven for 3 to 5 minutes (the preheated pan will make the baking time less). Repeat with the remaining 2 rounds.</p></li>
