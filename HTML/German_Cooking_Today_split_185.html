There are also many custard powders available on the market which make the dish even easier to make. If you add stiffly beaten egg white to the blancmange, it must be beaten stiff enough that it can be cut with a knife and then folded into the boiling hot mixture, otherwise it liquefies and the blancmange becomes runny. You can use a mould or 4 small ramekins but first rinse under cold water before filling with the blancmange mixture, then leave in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours. Loosen the edges with the point of a knife to make it easier to turn out of the mould.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Instant blancmange</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Cold liquid is thickened with a thickening agent, gelatine or vegetable gelling agent. These blancmanges are made without cooking and can be consumed immediately. Be careful to follow the manufacturer’s instructions on the packet.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Fruit pudding</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">To make a fruit pudding (for instance, red fruit pudding, green fruit pudding), berries or other fruit diced small, are brought to the boil together with fruit juice and thickened with cornflour (cornstarch), stirring continuously. Another method that preserves the vitamins in the fruit consists of first thickening the juice for pudding, then adding the fruit to the thickened fruit juice but without bringing to the boil. This method preserves the aroma and intense colours of the fruit. If using deep-frozen fruit, the juice must be thickened slightly more than with fresh fruit and the frozen fruit must be added to the boiling hot thickened juice (without bringing it to the boil again).</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Ice cream and sorbet</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">The basic ingredients of ice cream are sugar, eggs, milk or cream and flavouring ingredients such as vanilla, chocolate, lemon or strawberries. The ingredients are first whisked together in a hot bain-marie, then allowed to set by freezing. It is important to use exact quantities because the ice cream will be grainy if there is too little sugar, while if too much sugar is added, it will not set.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Sorbet is made with fruit purée, sugar syrup and sometimes stiffly beaten egg whites. The ingredients are then frozen. It is important to stir it occasionally during the freezing process to ensure a creamy consistency.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Owners of an ice cream maker can use it to make both ice cream and sorbet, following the manufacturer’s instructions.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">  </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Fruit salad</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Only ripe fruit should be used to make fruit salad. Ripe fruit is very sweet and therefore needs no added sugar. First, pour some freshly squeezed grapefruit or orange juice into a bowl, add the prepared fruit and mix well. Instead of using separate juice you can also use fruit that provides its own juice, such as grapes, melon and strawberries. The acid in the juice means that a delicate fruit, such as banana or apple, will retain its colour and not become brown. With fruit salads it is important to use fruit that differ in consistency, colour and taste, such as a juicy peach, a crisp apple, a creamy banana and a tart kiwi fruit.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Preparing oranges</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Using a sharp knife, cut around the top at the stalk end and the bottom of the orange as far as the flesh. Place the orange on a chopping board and, using a knife, cut off the skin all around thick enough to also remove the white pith. Then carefully cut out the segments from between the membranes surrounding them. Reserve the juice – it may be used in the recipe.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Gelatine</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Gelatine is used mainly as a gelling agent in creams and fruit jellies because it has a neutral taste. It is available ground or in leaves. As a rule of thumb, use 6 gelatine leaves or 1 pack of ground gelatine to set 500 ml/17 fl oz (2</span><sup class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">1</span></sup><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre6">⁄</span></span><span class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">4</span></span><span class="calibre6"> cups) liquid. Follow the instructions on the packet when making gelatine.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Soaking: Soak the leaf gelatine in cold water for about 5 minutes. Stir the ground gelatine in 6 tablespoons of cold liquid (depending on the recipe) in a small saucepan and leave to swell for up to 5 minutes.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Dissolving: Squeeze the swollen leaf gelatine lightly, put in a small saucepan, soak and stir over low heat to dissolve. The swollen ground gelatine should be dissolved over low heat, stirring continuously.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Setting cold liquids or mixtures: Add 2–3 tablespoons of the liquid or mixture to be set to the lukewarm gelatine solution and stir well to even out the temperature. Then mix this gelatine mixture into the liquid or mixture to be set, using a whisk.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Setting hot liquids: Add the swollen, squeezed leaf gelatine or swollen ground gelatine undissolved to the hot but not longer boiling liquid and stir until the gelatine is completely dissolved.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Cooling and setting Let the dish cool for several hours in the refrigerator if possible. If left in a cool room (for instance, the cellar) it will take much longer before it sets.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Tip</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Only fold in whipping cream or egg whites when the mixture containing the gelatine begins to set.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • A few fruits (e.g. pineapple, kiwi, figs and papaya) must be blanched before use. When raw they contain a proteolytic enzyme that affects the gelling property of gelatine.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Little glossary</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Cactus fig</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> The cactus fig is a reddishgreen fruit with very fine prickles and inedible skin.
