Some do take a bit of time and effort but they are satisfying to make, keep well and serve lots of people. These are perfect sharing dishes – something to put on the table and enjoy with friends. A terrine is defined by its long, loaf-like shape and can be made out of almost anything. A pâté, though, is invariably made of meat and is more often than not pork based, as it is the pork fat that gives pâté its richness. </p>
