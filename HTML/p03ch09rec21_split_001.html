<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">The recipe for this mythical dish appears in the memoirs of Laure Junot, Duchess of Abrantès, published in Paris in 1831. According to the duchess, it came from a culinary manuscript her husband, General Jean-Andoche Junot, had salvaged when his soldiers sacked the monastery of Alcántara in Extremadura while serving in Napoleon’s army during the Peninsular War. She popularized this way of cooking pheasant, woodcock, and quail, marinated in port wine and stuffed with foie gras pâté with truffles, calling it</span> à la mode d’Alcántara. <span class="italic">Auguste Escoffier later commented that the manuscript was the only worthwhile French gain from the war. While stuffing game birds with foie gras pâté has long been part of French haute cuisine, especially with quail, Spanish chefs have only recently pulled the style out of their past and developed their own versions. The pheasant is sometimes braised, but I prefer this version in which it is marinated for 24 hours in port and then roasted. I stuff it with store-bought duck’s liver pâté</span> <span class="italic">with truffles. In the monastery, they made the pâté</span> <span class="italic">themselves and added truffles to the port during the cooking. It is best to use hen pheasants rather than cocks—they have more fat and are more tender. Serve with boiled chestnuts (see page 408).</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4</span></p>
<p class="qun">2 young hen pheasants (about 1½ pounds each)</p>
<p class="qun">1½ cups port</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">5 ounces duck liver pâté with truffles</p>
<p class="qun1">10 to 12 slices pancetta or bacon</p>
<p class="recsum">Marinate the pheasants the day before cooking: Burn off any feathers and rinse the birds. Put each one in a large plastic bag. Pour half the port into each bag and twist the bags so that they are tightly closed around the birds. Marinate in the refrigerator, turning the bags a few times so as to soak the birds well all over.</p>
<p class="summary">Remove the birds and pour the port into a large baking dish. Season the birds lightly with salt, inside and out. Fill the cavity of each with half the pâté, and truss them (tie the legs together with kitchen twine). Place them in the baking dish, breast side up, and cover entirely with the pancetta or bacon, to prevent the flesh from drying out.</p>
<p class="summary">Cover loosely with foil and roast in a preheated 400°F oven for 45 to 60 minutes, until the legs pull away easily from the body and the juices run clear (a bird takes longer to cook when it is stuffed).</p>
<p class="summary">Carve the pheasants and serve with the stuffing and the sauce of port and roasting juices poured over.</p>
