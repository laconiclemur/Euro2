<h3 class="section_head"><span class="red">SANGRÍA</span></h3>
<p class="running_first">A big glass or terra-cotta <em>jarra</em> (pitcher or jug) of icy, fruit-filled, and spiked wine is perhaps Spain’s most iconic beverage. Sangria!</p>
<p class="running_first">Generally prepared with red wine, chopped fresh fruits, a shot or two of liqueur, sugar to sweeten it, and a carbonated beverage to fill it out, it’s chilled and served over plenty of ice. Sangria jugs come with a pinched spout to keep the fruit and ice from sloshing out and a wooden spoon to give it a final, vigorous stir before pouring into glasses.</p>
<p class="running_first">Spaniards particularly enjoy it during casual summer barbecues, on seaside terraces, and in <em>chiringuitos</em> (seasonal beach cafés) that dot the country’s lengthy coastline. It’s refreshing and fruity, sure, but above all, casual and often festive.</p>
<p class="running_first">My introduction came more than fifteen years ago when I moved to Barcelona. That first summer, the woman I had followed to Spain and I spent many weekends swimming in the coves along the Costa Brava, or from the long, white beaches in Tarragona. For a late lunch, we’d find a shady terrace and order fried squid <a href="62-chapter41.html#page_92">(see page 92)</a>, steamed octopus doused in olive oil and paprika <a href="62-chapter41.html#page_91">(see page 91)</a>, and spicy potatoes, along with a jarra of sangria. Here we’d linger as the sun eventually softened and the pine trees turned deeper shades of green.</p>
<p class="running_first">So I have good memories of drinking sangria, but less so of the drink itself. Too many bars and beachside cafés serve watered down, over-sweet, headache-inducing versions, and over the years my wife and I, like most of our friends, stopped drinking it.</p>
<p class="running_first">But then not long ago, I sampled a version very different than I remembered. It was sophisticated and more complex in its flavors, and sweetened naturally with fresh fruits. That reawakened our interest, and—at least at home—we began to give the classic drink another chance, making versions with red wine as well as white wine for our (usually surprised) friends who came to dinner.</p>
<p class="running_first">The key to good sangria, I learned, begins with the choice of wine, namely very young and fruity. For reds, that means plummy ones that carry touches of forest fruits, strawberries, and raspberries, even hints of vanilla. The second is the liqueur. A triple sec will add a touch of citrus, while the brilliant yellow Licor 43 some vanilla notes. But a tiny amount of Licor 43 is enough—any more and it becomes overpowering and cloying. And finally, ripe and sweet fresh fruit such as peaches, apricots, pears, certain (nonacidic) apples, and fresh berries. That’s it.</p>
<p class="running_first">Good—or at least different—sangria is mostly about what to omit, says Antoni Cot, the owner of my local wine shop: no orange juice (you don’t want to find pulp), no sugar, no citrus or acidic fruits (that would need sugar), and no fizzy water. Ideally no ice, either, which will water the drink down as the cubes melt. And chilled, but not below 50°F/10°C, at which point the cold begins to stifle the wine’s aromas and flavors. (Antoni was quite adamant about this last part.)</p>
<p class="running_first">These new versions of red wine sangria (see facing page) have been especially successful with appetizers and tapas that are both salty and sweet. White wine sangria <a href="220-chapter160.html#page_313">(see page 313)</a>, on the other hand, prepared with melon, fresh berries, and orange and lemon peels, is light and lovely, fruity, and perhaps more elegant than festive.</p>
<p class="running_first">These are a long way from those sticky-sweet versions once so enjoyed along the coast. For me, it’s the rekindling of an iconic drink by getting closer to its origins.</p>
