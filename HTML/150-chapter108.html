<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">My wife’s earliest memories of her grandmother’s kitchen in Lleida, on the flat, fruit-rich plain of western Catalunya, are of the pantry behind it. Among the preserves, canned fruits, and olives that lined the tall shelves were jars of <em>samfaina</em>, a stewed mélange of onions, tomatoes, and eggplant. She garnished grilled meats with it, spooned it over pig’s feet, and added it to the pot as a sauce for braising chicken, rabbit, and, during Lent, salt cod. This recipe makes a generous amount of samfaina; enough, if you are lucky, for leftovers to eat at room temperature as a thick relish. We spread it over pieces of toasted bread, just as my wife remembers her grandmother doing.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 MEDIUM GLOBE EGGPLANT</li>
<li>SALT</li>
<li>5 TABLESPOONS EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL</li>
<li>1 MEDIUM ONION, THINLY SLICED</li>
<li>1 RED BELL PEPPER, CUT INTO ½&gt;-INCH/1.25-CM PIECES</li>
<li>½&gt; SMALL GREEN BELL PEPPER, CUT INTO ½&gt;-INCH/1.25-CM PIECES</li>
<li>4 RIPE MEDIUM TOMATOES, PEELED, CORED, SEEDED, AND CUT INTO LARGE PIECES</li>
<li>2½&gt; POUNDS/1.2 KG BONE-IN CHICKEN LEGS OR BREASTS, SKIN REMOVED AND EXCESS FAT TRIMMED</li>
<li>FRESHLY GROUND BLACK PEPPER</li>
<li>ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR FOR DREDGING</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Rinse and stem the eggplant, but do not peel. Cut it into ½&gt;-inch/1.25-cm cubes. Place them in a colander, salt liberally, and let them sweat away some of their bitterness for 1 hour. Rinse well under running water and pat dry with paper towels. Gently squeeze some moisture from the eggplant and pat dry again.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a cazuela, heavy casserole, large sauté pan, or deep skillet, heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until soft and translucent, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the bell peppers and cook about 8 minutes, stirring frequently, and then add the eggplant. Cook for 5 minutes and add the tomatoes. Cook until the vegetables are pasty and soft, about 15 minutes. Add a touch of water if needed to keep it from drying out.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Meanwhile, in a large skillet or sauté pan, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. Season the chicken with salt and pepper and then lightly dredge in flour. Cook until golden, turning as needed, about 8 minutes.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> When the samfaina is ready, transfer the chicken to the cazuela and turn to coat. Add 1 cup/240 ml water, partly cover, and cook over low heat for about 50 minutes, until the chicken is very tender but not falling off the bone.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> To serve, divide the chicken among plates and generously cover with the samfaina.</p>
