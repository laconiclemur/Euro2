 FIVE-SPICE DUCK PIE</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_blue" id="nad0002945">
<em>Most of my recipes are inspired by a curiosity that keeps me up at night making notes. I often wondered what a cold game pie tasted like, but I couldn’t find a halal one that I could actually eat. So I decided to make my own. I was out looking for a goose at Christmas and stumbled upon a wholesaler selling ducks. I asked for 2 duck breasts but came home with 12 frozen ducks! It wasn’t easy to explain to my husband why I had 12 ducks, but needless to say, I made a lot of duck pies that year and this is one of them. Duck breast lends itself really well to Chinese five-spice. The blend I use is a mix of star anise, fennel seeds, cinnamon, black pepper and cloves. If you are feeling adventurous, you can make this blend yourself, though it’s easy to find similar ones in the spice aisles of most supermarkets.</em>

<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 For the filling, put the rashers, duck breasts, onion, coriander, five-spice, peanuts and orange zest into a bowl. Give it all a good mix by hand.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002961">
<span class="blue">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Preheat the oven to 180°C/160°C fan/gas 4 and have a 20cm loose-bottomed round tin ready.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002962">
<span class="blue">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 To make the pastry, put the water into a pan with the fat, then bring to the boil and turn off the heat immediately.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002963">
<span class="blue">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Put the flour into a large bowl and make a well in the centre. Add the hot water and fat mixture and mix with a palette knife. The mixture will be hot, so don’t get your hands in straight away. Leave for about 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002964">
<span class="blue">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Roll out the pastry on a clean surface, then set aside a third. Roll out the larger piece and line the base and sides of the tin with it, making sure to have some overhang. Put all the filling mixture into the tin and pat down.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002965">
<span class="blue">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Now roll out the other piece of pastry to make the lid and place it on top. Seal the edges by pressing, then cut off the excess and crimp the edges. Use any leftover pastry to decorate the pie however you wish. Glaze with the beaten egg and cut a slit in the top.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002966">
<span class="blue">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Bake for 30 minutes, then take out of the oven and lower the temperature to 160°C/140°C fan/gas 3. Brush the top of the pie with the eggwash again and put back into the oven for 90 minutes.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002967">
<span class="blue">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 Remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin for 2 hours, then take out of the tin and leave to chill in the fridge, covered with foil. This is great for a picnic or garden party.</p>
