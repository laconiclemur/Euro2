<h1 class="chapter0" id="itr"><a id="page6"/>introduction</h1>
<p class="nonindent">What could be more evocatively Spanish than to take refuge from the sun with a fortifying drink and to nibble at some fresh, tastebud-tingling, perfect tapas? Tradition holds that tapas was originally a slice of bread or ham used as a lid to keep insects out of drinks, hence the speculation that “tapas” is derived from the verb <em>tapar</em>, “to cover.”</p>
<p class="extract">However it started, tapas is now a staple of the Spanish bar experience, where mouthfuls of delicious treats, mostly on toasts or carvings of bread, are served with traditional toppings like morcilla and piquillo peppers or pâtés and cured meats with capers.</p>
<p class="extract">Yet this is by no means where tapas ends. The notion of perfect and delicious little bar snacks has now taken wing from its humble beginnings, developing into a worldwide gastronomic delight perceptively different from the usual restaurant experience. Still essentially Spanish in its compositions of herbs, seasonings, and ingredients, tapas has become more luxurious and decadent while still maintaining the feel of convivial food.</p>
<p class="extract">Now that the popularity of tapas has become a worldwide trend, it is possible to observe an evolution in its styles. It has become feasible to take almost any popular meal, minimize it down to a single tasting-sized portion, and presto, a new tapas has sprung from the void. In this book you will find examples of this, such as a ballotine of rabbit on white beans, and lightly spiced quail pieces with a pomegranate sauce.</p>
<p class="extract">Tapas and the dynamic of sharing food has created an amazing assortment of large, one-pot dishes, specially styled as a focal point, around which a group can sit and chat, scooping off mouthful-sized portions as the mood takes them. Such examples of this are slow-roasted lamb shoulder with pomegranate salad, and crisped pork belly with slow-cooked beans. Can you imagine a more enticing shared delight than a party pulling apart these aromatic and tender meats in good company with excellent wine?</p>

<p class="nonindent">The other style to emerge in tapas is what to all intents and purposes appears to be a large plated serving of food — a meal for one. On further inspection, these dishes are always cunningly created to be shared — such as a rare ribeye steak served with polenta fries and piquillo peppers, or a beautifully pan-fried piece of chicken in a nest of truffled gnocchi. Certainly it’s more fun to have lots of plates on the table and sample a little from each than to have just one large meal to oneself.</p>
<p class="extract">Tapas is all about sharing in so many ways. It is not just a food genre, it is a means for gathering and convening, of drinking wine, talking, and indulging together on something that is just a little bit special. I hope you have a wonderful time exploring the world of tapas with <em>500 Tapas</em>.</p>
<h2 class="section"><a id="page8"/>ingredients</h2>
<p class="extract"><strong>olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Spanish olive oils are unique. They have a deepness and richness unlike many others and are such an important part in Spanish cooking. I would find a good light one for simple frying and cooking, and a really good extra-virgin olive oil for dipping, making dressings, emulsions, and richer sauces.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>smoked paprika</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Smoked paprika is one of the most Spanish of all the spices. Its bright red color just screams Spain! Spanish paprika (<em>pimentón</em>) is available in three versions — mild (pimentón dulce), moderately spicy (<em>pimentón agridulce</em>), and very spicy (pimentón picante).</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>saffron</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Saffron is a spice that is simply the stamen of the saffron crocus. It is the most expensive spice in the world. It has a soapy bitter taste when used in abundance and dyes the food bright yellow, but used sparingly it adds a warmth and aroma to a dish.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>piquillo peppers</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The piquillo pepper is a variety of chile traditionally grown in northern Spain. Its name is derived from the Spanish for “little beak.” These peppers are roasted over embers, which gives them a distinct sweet, spicy flavor, more similar to bell peppers than chile peppers, despite their small size. They are then peeled and seeded by hand, before being packed into jars.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>pimientos de padrón</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Pimientos de Padrón are small green peppers roughly the size of your thumb. They’re fried in olive oil, salted, and served at many tapas bars in Spain. Besides being salty and sweet, most <a id="page9"/>people eat pimientos de Padrón for the fun of it. Eating them is considered a form of culinary Russian roulette. Some are sweet. Others are hot enough to blow your mind!</p>

<p class="figure"><a class="hlink" href="9781416207306_epub_c02_r1.htm#page41">puree de habas</a></p>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>membrillo</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">This quince jelly is wonderful with cheeses, game, or pâté, and it also works well spread with roasted meats and whipped up into aïoli.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>chorizo</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Chorizo is a sausage that comes either fresh or semidry, in which case it must be cooked before eating, or as a sausage that has been cured and hung. Spanish chorizo gets its distinctive smokiness and deep red color from paprika. It is the heart of many Spanish dishes.</p>
<div class="dis_img"><img alt="" src="images/9781416207306_005.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figure"><a id="page10"/><a class="hlink" href="9781416207306_epub_c01_r1.htm#page20">charcuterie with pickled garlic &amp; caper berries</a></p>
<p class="nonindent"><a id="page11"/><strong>morcilla</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Morcilla is a Spanish black pudding or blood sausage. What makes it different from other blood sausages is that it has more texture from its rice filling and is a little spicier. For those who aren’t sure about eating blood pudding, try morcilla. It’s one of the best in the world.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>anchovies</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Salted or vinegared anchovies are a staple of the Spanish diet. If using the salted variety, they can be added to dishes to add seasoning. If you don’t think you’re a fan, still give them a try. They can be the backbone to the most authentic Spanish flavor.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>capers &amp; caperberries</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Capers are the unripened flower buds of <em>Capparis spinosa</em>. After the buds are harvested, they are dried in the sun, then pickled in vinegar, brine, or salt. The curing brings out their tangy lemony flavor, much the same as green olives. You find them in various sizes from tiny balls, which add punch, to the more grown-up caper berries that are not quite as interesting but add drama to your dish.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>sherry (fino)</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Sherry is as big in Spain as wine. In Spanish cooking you would be as likely to find a good sherry in your food as you would wine. A good dry fino would be the store cupboard essential I would recommend, but there are some recipes that call for the super thick and sweet Pedro Ximénez and also a richer amontillado.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>sherry vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">With sherry’s popularity in Spain, it is the vinegar of choice too. In the same way the Italians credit their balsamic, the Spanish take great pride in their sherry vinegars. You will find them in many different qualities. As with oils, get the best you can afford.</p>
<h2 class="section"><a id="page12"/>equipment</h2>
<p class="nonindent">One of the many joys of tapas is that very little specialty equipment is essential. There are just a very few pieces that will make your homemade tapas experience a little more authentic, but to start with, you can certainly make do with whatever is already in your kitchen. Should you wish to invest, here are a selection of dishes and pans that will be wonderful additions to your kitchen.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>paella pan</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Spanish food wouldn’t be Spanish food without a good paella pan. These pans are classically made from polished steel, but now you can find a wide variety in all sorts of shapes and sizes from stainless steel to nonstick to cast-iron. Now they are even made for induction cooktops. The paella in this book is to feed four people, so a smaller pan, about 12 inches in diameter, would be ideal.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>mini tortilla pan</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Small tortilla pans may seem like a luxury, but the small tortilla recipe in this book outweighs larger tortillas for flavor and freshness, and you can undercook them a little easier, giving that luscious gooey middle.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>earthenware tapas dishes</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Earthenware is what you would classically find tapas in. It is the perfect material. You can bake with it, and it keeps your food hot and in individual portions. I would get a selection of sizes, as you can use smaller ones for olives and nuts and larger ones for the more substantial dishes. The classic size is around 4 1/2 to 6 inches.</p>
<div class="dis_img"><img alt="" src="images/9781416207306_006.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figure"><a id="page13"/><a class="hlink" href="9781416207306_epub_c03_r1.htm#page86">paella with seafood &amp; chicken</a></p>
<div class="dis_img"><img alt="" src="images/9781416207306_007.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figure"><a id="page14"/><a class="hlink" href="9781416207306_epub_c04_r1.htm#page111">chicken with potatoes, olives &amp; sherry</a></p>
<p class="nonindent"><a id="page15"/><strong>ovenproof ceramic dishes</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">As an alternative to earthenware, you can have a selection of dishes made from glazed ceramic — anything from the size and depth of a ramekin to a shorter wider variety.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>wooden boards</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">As charcuterie is such a major part of the tapas culture, having a beautiful wooden board for serving cold meats on is a must for tapas.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>wooden kebab skewers</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The idea of tapas is that it’s a mouthful of food, and what easier way of making tasty mouthfuls than serving dishes as kebabs. I would suggest small lengths, maybe long enough to fit two or three pieces of meat, fish, or vegetables.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>toothpicks</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Go into any tapas bar in Madrid and the bread tapas will be held together with toothpicks. There will be toothpicks to pick up your olives. Toothpicks to skewer things. A box of toothpicks will never go unused when serving your tapas.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>mortar &amp; pestle</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">When dealing with spices and aromatics, having a good sturdy mortar and pestle around to pound flavor into food is essential. I like the gravel-textured ones that are really heavy.</p>
