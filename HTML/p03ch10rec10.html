<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Cochinillo</span>, or <span class="italic">tostón</span>, is the most exquisite and aristocratic of foods. It is a newborn pig between fifteen and twenty days old that weighs between 6½ and 10 pounds and serves six to eight people. It should be roasted slowly to such melting tenderness that it can be cut with the edge of a plate—which is what happens dramatically on festive occasions. Within the triangle delimited by the cities of Segovia, Arévalo, and Peñaranda de Bracamonte, the finest roast suckling pigs are cooked. I ate a fabulous <span class="italic">cochinillo</span> at the Maracaibo—the best restaurant for miles around—in the hilltop city of Segovia. The Romans built a great aqueduct there, and the Moors an <span class="italic">alcázar</span> (fortress), and the city is full of Romanesque churches and mansions.</p>
<p class="summary">In the past, people took their little pigs in clay dishes to be roasted in the baker’s communal wood-burning oven. At Maracaibo, as in most grand restaurants today, they are cooked <span class="italic">sous-vide</span>, but I asked the chef about the traditional way of cooking them in a domestic oven. These are the instructions for cooking a 10-pound suckling pig as sent to me by Oscar Hernando, the owner, head chef, and sommelier at Maracaibo.</p>
<p class="summary">Ask the butcher to butterfly the cleaned suckling pig by cutting it open through the belly (leaving the head intact). Salt it inside only and lay it opened out flat, skin side up, on a rack in a roasting pan. Wrap the ears in foil to protect them from burning. Pour in 2 cups water, to create steam in the oven, and put the pig in a preheated 350°F oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 275°F and cook for 2 hours, then increase the heat to 350°F and cook for another 15 minutes, or until the skin is crisp and golden. Let it rest for a few minutes, and cut into slices.</p>
