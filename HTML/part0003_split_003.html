			<p class="rec-intro">I love scrambled eggs, the creamier the better, and I’ll eat them at any time of day as a starter or a main meal. I first came across this rather special version when working at the Élysée Palace for President Mitterrand.</p>

			<p class="body">First make the choux buns. Preheat the oven to 240°C/Fan 220°C/Gas 9. Pour the water and milk into a pan, add the butter, salt and sugar and bring to the boil. Take the pan off the heat and beat in the flour. Once all the flour has been incorporated put the pan back on the heat and cook for 6–7 minutes, stirring continuously. Take the pan off the heat again and beat in 4 of the eggs, one at a time, and mix until smooth. The mixture might look as though it is splitting but keep beating and it will all come together.</p>
			<p class="body">Put the mixture into a piping bag and pipe 24 little rounds on to a non-stick baking sheet, taking care to keep them all about the same size and shape so they cook evenly. Beat the remaining egg and use it to brush the buns, then bake them for 5 minutes. Open the oven door to release the steam, turn the temperature down to 200°C/Fan 180°C/Gas 6 and cook for another 12–15 minutes or until crisp and cooked. Remove and place on a rack to cool. </p>
			<p class="body">Season the chicken supremes with salt and pepper. Heat the butter in a frying pan until foaming and fry the chicken until golden on both sides and very pink inside. Take the chicken out of the pan and discard the butter. Deglaze the pan with the port, then cook to reduce by half. Add the chicken jus and reduce to a sauce consistency. Cut the chicken into small dice, put it back in the sauce and continue to cook until done.</p>
			<p class="body">Now for the eggs. Use all the butter to grease a thick-based saucepan, then add the beaten eggs and cook over a medium heat while stirring with a spatula. When the eggs are almost completely cooked, season and pour in the double cream.</p>
			<p class="body">To serve, cut the tops off the choux buns and fill them three-quarters full with scrambled eggs, followed by the chicken mixture. Place the lids back on top and serve immediately.</p>
