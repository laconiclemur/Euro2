<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">This simple, flavorful dish got its start, according to respected Spanish culinary historian Néstor Luján, in nineteenth-century Barcelona, and still recalls the inns and small taverns of the time.</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">     A <em>llauna</em> is a rectangular pan with low, straight sides. Use a rimmed baking sheet, rectangular cake pan, or a roasting pan. It is important that you don’t overcook the cod in the skillet. The fish should just flake away in moist pieces on the plate—that’s it. And there should be plenty of oil to spoon over the top and to soak up with bread.</span></strong></p>

<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Beginning 2 to 3 days ahead, desalt the cod following the directions on <a href="250-chapter186.html#page_341">page 341</a>. Do not remove the skin. Drain in a colander skin-side up for at least 1 to 2 hours. Pat dry with paper towels. There should be about 2¼ pounds/1 kg of desalted fillets.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> Preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C/gas mark 4.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Lightly dredge the cod in flour and fry until golden and not yet flaking apart, about 4 minutes total, turning once. Remove the skillet from the heat. Transfer the pieces of cod to paper towels to briefly drain. Arrange the salt cod skin-side up on a rimmed baking sheet.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Return the skillet to the stove. Add the garlic and cook over medium heat until fragrant and just golden, about 45 seconds. Do not let it burn. Remove the skillet from the heat, let the oil cool for a few moments, and then stir in the pimentón until dissolved.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Immediately spoon the oil and garlic over the fish. Dribble 1 tablespoon water around the base. Bake for 3 minutes, or until warmed throughout.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">6.</span> Carefully transfer the salt cod to plates, spoon over the sauce, and, if desired, lightly garnish with parsley before serving.</p>
