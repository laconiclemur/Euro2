  <h3 class="h3a">Tagliatelle with lamb and wild fennel</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">When we talk about ragù, we tend to think of the traditional sauce made with beef and tomatoes. This is a much lighter version, made <em class="calibre4">in bianco</em> (‘in the white’ – as Italians refer to dishes not cooked in tomato sauce). Italians tend to eat this dish in the spring, when lamb is at its best and wild fennel is found in abundance. Rather than using minced (ground) lamb, I use a piece of lamb cut into small bite-size pieces, keeping its texture, and slow-cook it on a gentle heat. The simple combination of lamb, wild fennel and a sprinkling of pecorino is delicious.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 onion, finely sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 celery stalk, finely sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">400g/14oz lamb, cut into small pieces</p>

  <p class="ing1">100ml/3½fl oz/scant ½ cup dry white wine</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">a handful of wild fennel, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">300ml/10fl oz/1¼ cups <a href="part0007_split_013.html#pg32" class="calibre1">vegetable stock</a> – or use a stock cube</p>

  <p class="ing1">325g/11½oz dried tagliatelle pasta</p>

  <p class="ing2">40g/1½oz pecorino (romano) cheese, grated</p>

  <p class="para">Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan, add the onion and celery and sweat on a low heat for 20 minutes, stirring from time to time, until softened.</p>

  <p class="para">Increase the heat, add the lamb and brown well all over. Add the wine and allow to evaporate. Season and add a couple of fennel sprigs and 100ml/3½fl oz/scant ½ cup of the stock. Reduce the heat to very low, cover with a lid and cook for 1 hour, checking from time to time and gradually adding a little more of the stock. After about 55 minutes, stir in the remaining fennel.</p>

  <p class="para1">When almost ready to serve, bring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to the boil and cook the tagliatelle until al dente. Drain, reserving a little of the cooking water. Add the pasta and a couple of tablespoons of the cooking water to the sauce and mix well. Remove from the heat, sprinkle with the pecorino and serve.</p>
