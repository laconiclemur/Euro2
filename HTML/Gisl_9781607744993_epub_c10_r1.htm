    <p class="nonindent1_break"><a id="page237"/><span class="C_COTX"><span class="dk_blue"><a id="ind232a"/>Icelanders have always been resourceful.</span></span> They have to be in order to live in a climate that is unforgiving to the apathetic and punishes the uncreative with winters that they won’t survive. The land of primarily porous lava stone affords little opportunity for farming, and the short spring and summer seasons ensure an empty pantry in the dead of winter, if foods are not preserved during the warmer months.</p>
<p class="extract">One of the country’s oldest forms of preservation comes in the form of <em><a id="ind236a"/><a id="ind291a"/>hardfiskur</em>, a beloved snack coveted by many Icelanders who would happily trade in a loaf of warm bread for a fillet of ocean air–dried fish slathered in butter. Grain has little chance to flourish in Iceland, save for in a few remote regions, and <em>hardfiskur</em>, wolf fish that has been dried in the ocean air, is the healthy alternative.</p>
<p class="extract">Today, open-air wooden drying houses still dot the shores of the northern territories. But the practice of drying <em>hardfiskur</em> in the open air, which takes months, is rapidly being replaced by a far quicker method that relies on large, industrial dehydrating rooms, a trend that strips this time-honored food from its connection to the past. Among the stalwarts of traditional <em>hardfiskur</em> production are a father and his two sons who live in the remote <a id="ind654a"/>Westfjords. Today, they must source their fish by buying it at auction, just as everyone is required to do, but little else has changed in the production method.</p>
<p class="extract">They fillet the fish themselves and dry the heads and bones on separate drying racks for sending to western Africa, where they are sold and used for making stews and sauces. The fillets are dipped in a brine, hung by hand on wooden sticks, and then piled into the back of a truck and transported to the massive drying house. Once there, the father hands the poles to one of his sons, who hangs them. Their cheeks are red and ruddy from the brisk ocean air, but their smiles are ready and their pride in preserving one of Iceland’s most ancient traditions is palpable. The fish dries throughout the winter, and at the end of the season, what was once fresh from the sea is dehydrated to briny perfection. It’s a tradition Icelanders still revere, and with one bite of <em>hardfiskur</em> spread with butter, it’s easy to understand why.</p>
<h2 class="A2" id="c10-s71"><a id="page238"/><span class="dk_blue">An Interview with Hardfiskur Producer Finnbogi Jónasson</span></h2>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> How long has your family been in the <em>hardfiskur</em> business?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">My father started this business in 1985, and now my brother and I are co-owners. We sell our <em>hardfiskur</em> throughout Iceland and also to Norway. We own a fishing boat, but because we do not catch enough ourselves, we have to buy additional fish from the market to supplement our catch. We don’t really own the fish we catch because of the quota system. All fish have to go to the market, so they are never really ours. You catch them and then you have to buy them back. It’s very frustrating. We buy over 150 tons of fish per year. But the process itself has become easier in recent years, because instead of having to go to auctions held throughout the country, we can participate in them online. It has been a big time-saver for us. I watch the auction all day long and put in a bid when the fish reaches the price I am willing to pay. I do it almost every day.</p>
<p class="Answer">From summer to fall, I work the line on the boat, and then in the fall, I begin processing the fish for <em>hardfiskur</em>. My brother and father also participate in this. Our boat is small, so we do only coastal fishing. You don’t earn a lot of money for this fish. Some want the quota, some don’t, and there are only certain days when you’re allowed to fish. Because of overfishing, we’re not allowed to fish halibut any longer. If you catch one, you have to throw it back. Slowly the quota system has created fewer and fewer jobs. In the early 1990s, the fishing industry started to decline. There used to be four trawlers here, now there are only two. The fish companies have merged, and nowadays it’s becoming more difficult to be a family-owned business.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> How is <em>hardfiskur</em> produced?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">The fish are bigger in the winter, so we start filleting in September and then begin hanging the fillets in the drying sheds in October. We brine the fillets for four or five hours before we hang them, and then we hang from October through April. It’s nice to get a good frost. But we don’t like <em>skafrenningur</em> (when snow blows in from the side and builds up against the houses). This is bad for us. The snow comes into direct contact with the fish, which, of course, is something we don’t want to happen.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> What is the history of <em>hardfiskur</em> in Iceland?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">We’ve been producing it for centuries. It started with the Vikings. In the past, the whole fish, including the head, would be hung.</p>
<p class="Answer"><a id="page239"/>Long ago, a type of cod called <em><a id="ind160a"/><a id="ind566a"/>skreith</em> was our main export. It is brined fish that is air-dried and then rehydrated for cooking. It’s between <em>hardfiskur</em> and bacalao. It’s not something we would ever use in Iceland. It was mainly used in Africa. We also start salting the fish to create bacalao. The Spanish and Portuguese wanted this salted cod, which is where it all began—and all of the cod went to them. This is why we started using wolffish for our own <em>hardfiskur</em>.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> How has <em>hardfiskur</em> production changed over the years?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">There are now modern ways of making <em>hardfiskur</em>: They use drying ovens instead of drying the fish in the open air. We are among the last ones to dry the fish the traditional way. My dad used to be a sailor, and he has always lived here. Our family’s life is on the sea, and we do not want this tradition to disappear. There’s a lot less work here now, and people are moving away because of it. The large freezing houses have closed down. When I was a child, there was much more business. From 1985 to 1990 was a golden age. It’s slow now. Business is hard.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Has the increase in tourism in recent years helped?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">Yes, but I don’t think we will be able to survive on that. Tourists don’t come in the winter because the roads are impassable. The authorities say winter tourism is increasing, but it’s not affecting us. We see it a bit, but it won’t help us survive the winter. Our fish is much more expensive because it takes much longer to dry in the traditional way. It is completely different from the machine-dried fish. When it’s done this way, the <em>hardfiskur</em> contains the aromas and flavors of the ocean air that dries it.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> How did the economic collapse affect you?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">After the economic collapse, people from here moved south and also to Norway. We lost most of our quota at this time, too. The government is always interfering. We need jobs and we need quiet to conduct our business. The government is trying to control everything, and with the new taxation on businesses, many of them had to close their doors. So they destroyed jobs and the businesses, too.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Even with the challenges you face, do you find that people are still interested in traditionally produced <em>hardfiskur</em>?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">Yes, demand is growing. There is hope.</p>

<p class="Essays_header"><span class="dk_blue"><a id="ind655a"/>TRAVEL IN THE WESTFJORDS</span></p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">The Westfjords is one of the most remote regions of Iceland, and for a country at the top of the planet, that is quite a statement. It is not the distance from Reykjavík that makes the Westfjords remote, as its southern entrance point is only about a five-hour drive away. The fjords themselves are what can make driving along the coast feel endless—though always breathtaking.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">The main town of <a id="ind327a"/>Isafjördur, where <em>hardfiskur</em> producer <a id="ind233a"/>Finnbogi Jónasson is located, is a quaint home base from which to explore the region. It boasts postcard-ready streets lined with boutiques and with restaurants serving some of the best fish stew in Iceland. Bird-watching opportunities abound in the Westfjords, and a roughly two-hour drive from Isafjördur is <a id="ind198a"/>Dynjandi, home to one of the country’s most breathtaking waterfalls.</p>
    <p class="Essays_nonindent">A two-hour ferry ride from the town of <a id="ind604a"/>Stykkishólmur on <a id="ind587a"/>Snaefellsnes Peninsula is one way to access the Westfjords, but the drive along the southern roads from where it lands is painstakingly long. The town of <a id="ind492a"/>Reykjanes in the northern fjords is the ideal entrance point if traveling by car. It’s where the salt producer <a id="ind529a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c11_r1.htm#page255">Saltverk</a> is located, and it is an easy drive from the town to the northern region. However you choose to get to the beautiful Westfjords region, it is likely you will agree that the extra effort you expended to get there was worth it.</p>

<div class="headnote">Icelanders often refer to <a id="ind247a"/><a id="ind669a"/>wolffish, the large, firm-textured white fish used primarily for making <em>hardfiskur</em>, as catfish. No one seems to know why, but one good guess would be because of the “whiskers” both fish share. Wolffish cannot be purchased outside of Iceland, so this recipe calls for catfish instead. However, any white fish with a firm texture, such as halibut or cod, would make a fine substitute. The fish is covered in powdered herbal tea, which delivers an unexpected flavor (Gunnar uses herbal tea from Sverrir). The barley used here is pearl barley, which provides a weighty counterpoint with an appealing chew to the seafood.</div>

<p class="IL_item"><strong>1 cup (200 g) pearl barley</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1½ tablespoons unsalted butter</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Salt</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong><a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-sec1">Beer Vinegar</a>, for seasoning</strong></p>
<p class="IL_head"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>SAUCE</strong></span></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Burned butter, oil, and tea from frying fish (above)</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>2 teaspoons stone-ground mustard</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item_space"><strong>Fresh lovage leaves, for garnish</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">To make the catfish, cover the fish evenly with the tea to create a crust. Heat the oil and butter in a sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the fish and panfry, turning once, for about 9 minutes, until cooked through. Remove from the heat, transfer the fish to a plate, and season with salt. Reserve the pan with the mixture of burned butter and oil and crust crumbs for making the sauce.</div>
<div class="method">To make the vegetable puree, combine the carrot, celery root, rutabaga, onion, stock, thyme, bay leaves, and butter in a small saucepan, season with salt, and bring to a boil over <a id="page245"/>medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low and cook at a gentle simmer for about 25 minutes, until the stock has evaporated and the vegetables have caramelized in the butter. Remove from the heat, transfer to a blender, and process at high speed until a smooth puree forms. Season with salt and vinegar.</div>
<div class="method">To make the barley, combine the barley and water to cover by 1½ inches (4 cm) in a saucepan, salt lightly, and bring to a boil over high heat. Turn down the heat to a simmer and cook for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until tender. Remove from the heat and drain well.</div>
<div class="method">Melt the butter in a sauté pan over medium heat and stir in the barley. Once the barley is glistening with butter, remove it from the heat and season it with salt and beer vinegar.</div>
<div class="method">To make the sauce, place the pan in which you fried the fish over medium heat, add the mustard and a couple spoonfuls of water, and stir to deglaze the pan, dislodging any browned bits on the pan bottom. Add the butter and swirl the pan to melt the butter and emulsify the sauce.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, arrange the catfish on plates with spoonfuls of the vegetable puree and barley alongside. Slick the fish with the sauce and garnish with the lovage.</div>

<div class="headnote1">When we traveled to visit the <em>hardfiskur</em> producer in the <a id="ind656a"/>Westfjords, we needed to carry provisions, as markets are few and far between in this remote area. Oatmeal is a good staple to pack: it will warm you up in the morning and can be drizzled with birch syrup and sprinkled with sea salt to conclude the evening.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent">This recipe illustrates Gunnar’s commitment to showcasing vegetables in the dessert course, rather than restricting them to a savory course and finishing with a sugary concoction. If you are having difficulty locating sunchokes, parsnips or celery root are good substitutes. The oatmeal pudding and the oatmeal crumble provide a nice crunchy balance to the silky ice cream, but each element also makes a comforting breakfast item, together or separately. The ice cream is so good that it just might find its way to the breakfast table, too.</div>
<div class="ingredient">
<p class="IL_head_top"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>SUNCHOKE ICE CREAM</strong></span></p>

<p class="IL_item"><strong>2 tablespoons fresh chervil leaves, chopped, for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Raisins soaked in dark rum until plumped, for garnish</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">To make the ice cream, prepare an ice bath. Combine the milk, cream, and sunchokes in a saucepan and bring to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat. Cook for about 10 minutes, until the sunchokes are tender. Add the sugar and glucose and stir until dissolved. Remove from the heat, transfer to a blender, and begin processing on low speed to prevent the hot mixture from splattering. Once the elements are incorporated, increase the speed to high and continue to process until smooth. Season with salt, transfer to a bowl, and nest in the ice bath until chilled. Transfer to an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Scoop into an airtight container and place in the freezer for 12 hours, until solid.</div>
<div class="method"><a id="page249"/>To make the pudding, combine the oats, sugar, and milk in a saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat and let stand at room temperature until the oats are tender and have absorbed much of the liquid. If the pudding is too thick, add some water or more milk to achieve the desired consistency. Add the butter, a cube at a time, stirring in each one until fully incorporated before adding the next cube. The texture should be that of a soft oatmeal cookie hot from the oven. Season with salt. Let stand at room temperature until ready to serve.</div>
<div class="method">To make the crumble, preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Melt the butter in a small pan over medium heat, then remove from the heat. In a bowl, stir together the oats, flour, and brown sugar. Pour the melted butter into the oat mixture and stir until the dry ingredients are evenly coated with the butter. Season with salt. Pour onto the prepared baking sheet and spread in an even layer. Bake, rotating the pan back to front at the midway point, for 8 to 10 minutes, until toasted and lightly browned. Let cool to room temperature. Transfer to a blender or food processor and pulse until coarsely ground.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, spoon the ice cream and pudding onto a plate. Sprinkle with the crumble and raisins and garnish with the chervil.</div>

<div class="method">Drying as a means of preservation is not used only for fish in Iceland. It is employed for countless raw ingredients as a way to afford a taste of them in even the darkest, coldest months of the year. Dried foods are not as flavorful as their fresh counterparts, but they do provide a fleeting memory of the summer when they were gathered.</div>
<div class="method">Pick artic thyme sprigs with their blossoms intact or before their blossoms appear, as once the blossoms fall off, the thyme begins to taste slightly bitter. Dry the sprigs outdoors in the sun for about 24 hours (bringing them in at night to protect the thyme from the elements), until all of the moisture is gone. Carefully place the sprigs in an airtight container and store in a cool, dark place.</div>

<div class="method">At Dill, Gunnar saves his vegetable peels, spreads them out on a tray, puts the tray in a moisture-free area, and leaves the peels to dry, taking no special effort to dehydrate them. There are many uses for dried vegetables peels, such as infusions and stocks, but Gunnar most often uses them for smoking. He sees them as just as good as wood chips, and they inevitably add a nice flavor.</div>
<div class="method">Nearly any dried vegetable peel will prove useful. At Dill, onion, parsnip, and celery peels and odd bits of fennel are the most commonly dried. Store the dried peels in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.</div>

<div class="method">Use these bright-flavored angelica rings as a seasoning on vegetables. You can also grind them in a spice grinder to a powder and use the powder to season salads, soups, meat, or seafood.</div>
<div class="method">Preheat a dehydrator to 120°F (48°C). Slice as many <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c06_r1.htm#c06-s41">pickled angelica stalks</a> as desired into thin rings. Arrange the rings in a single layer on a dehydrator tray and dehydrate for about 3 hours, until crispy. Do not overdry them or they will be flavorless. Store the angelica rings in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.</div>
<h2 class="Recipe_Title1" id="c10-s77"><span class="dk_blue">PICKLED <span class="RT_Joanna">and</span> DRIED CROWBERRIES</span></h2>
<div class="yield">MAKES ABOUT 2 CUPS (220 G) <span class="yield_pipe">|</span> PREPARATION TIME: ABOUT 1 MONTH (INCLUDES THE PICKLING TIME)</div>
<div class="headnote"><a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_bm1_r1.htm#bm1-K12">Crowberries</a> are one of the most plentiful berry varieties in Iceland but are difficult to find elsewhere. Blueberries are a good substitute, though nearly any berry can be pickled and dried to give it a second life in its off-season. Use the berries on desserts or grind them to a powder in a spice grinder and use as a seasoning for game.</div>
<div class="ingredient">
<p class="IL_item"><strong>2 cups (300 g) crowberries</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1 cup (240 ml) distilled white vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>½ cup (100 g) sugar</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>2 or 3 small crowberry bush branches</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">Put the berries in a heatproof glass jar. Combine the vinegar and sugar in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Throw in a few crowberry branches and simmer for about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and let cool to 104°F (40°C). Discard the branches and strain the liquid through a fine-mesh sieve. Pour the liquid over the crowberries, immersing them. Let cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate for 1 month.</div>
<div class="method">Preheat a dehydrator to 200°F (93°C). Drain the berries, reserving the berries and the liquid. Use the pickling juice on desserts and salads. Spread the berries in a single layer on a dehydrator tray and dehydrate the berries for about 12 hours, until crispy. Store the berries in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 month.</div>
