<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Surely one of the great flavor combinations is chilled Spanish <em>melón</em>—an oblong summer melon with a webbed, dark-green rind and pale-green flesh—and dry-cured jamón. The honeyed sweetness of the former accentuates the earthy, salty flavors of the latter. Store the melon in the refrigerator and slice just before serving so that it is nicely chilled. Fresh figs make an excellent combo, too—sweeter even, more jammy, than fresh melon—and another perfect counter for the salty jamón.</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">     The best season for melons is the hot one, as one is reminded by this old expression: <em>“En tiempo de melones, cortos los sermones.”</em> (Basically, in the season of melons, the priest is advised to keep sermons short.) This dish is a perfect tonic for such summer days, and one that frequently begins lunch on the terrace of my in-laws’ beach place. Or—if it doesn’t begin the meal, then this combination often ends it. It is a typical dessert, too.</span></strong></p>
