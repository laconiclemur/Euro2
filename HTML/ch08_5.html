<p class="author"><span class="txit">vegetali e contorni</span></p>
<p class="noindenti"><span class="stickup">G</span>ardening was a way of life for my grandparents. At their house on the Point in Verplanck, New York, they cultivated a wide variety of fruits and vegetables—there was always something growing year-round. Pole beans, cucumbers, peppers, zucchini, eggplant, tomatoes, escarole, and more—I have fond memories of helping Nonno Tropiano in the garden when I was very little. He also had a root cellar for the garlic, onions, potatoes, and celery he grew. With all of this bounty, it was rare for my mother’s family to eat a vegetable they hadn’t grown.</p>
<p class="indenti">The great thing about these vegetable and side dish recipes is that even children will eat them. For a young boy to look forward to eggplant sandwiches is a rare thing. But I did. For children to beg for stuffed mushrooms seems an impossibility, but it’s not—mine do. You will find these dishes to be more than something that “goes with.” Instead, you may end up looking for dishes to “go with” them. Enjoy.</p>
