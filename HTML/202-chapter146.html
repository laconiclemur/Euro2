<p class="yield">MAKES ONE 10-INCH/25-CM TART</p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">The Galician city of Santiago de Compostela lies at the end of the famous, thousand-year-old pilgrimage route that crosses northern Spain, called <em>El Camino de Santiago</em> (The Way of St. James). It is a spectacular city, with a marvelous cathedral dating to the early thirteenth century that holds the remains of the Apostle Saint James (Santiago in Spanish). For many gastronomes, though, the city is best known for giving its name to this ancient almond tart.</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">     Tartas de Santiago are prepared all across Spain these days, but an authentic one does not have a crust and is made without flour. Officially—and it <em>is</em> a protected product with a seal of guarantee—ground almonds make up at least one-third of the weight of the total ingredients and sugar another one-third. Eggs, butter, lemon zest, and perhaps some liqueur make up the remaining. The top generally has the distinctive dusting of powdered sugar that’s been done over a simple template, leaving the gothic-looking Cross of the Order of St. James visible. It is easy to do. Cut out a piece of butcher paper, lay it on top of the cooled cake, and sift the powdered sugar over top.</span></strong></p>
