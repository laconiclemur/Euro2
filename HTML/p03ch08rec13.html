<p class="summary1">Sea salt is produced in salt pans <span class="italic">(salinas)</span> in Cádiz, Murcia, Majorca, and Ibiza as well as in the estuary of the Ebro River in Catalonia and the Canary Islands. The Phoenicians introduced the original techniques for extracting it from the sea and also the way of cooking fish in it. In the last few years, Spain has seen, apart from industrial salt production, the growing harvest of a high-quality gourmet salt called <span class="italic">flor de sal</span>. This is the crunchy irregular crystallized flakes that form on the surface of special evaporation pools on beaches in hot, sunny, dry, windy conditions. The top layers are collected by hand as they form by skimming them off the surface of the water with a net at the end of a pole. <span class="italic">Flor de sal</span> has a distinctive taste of the sea, and its high magnesium content makes it a flavor enhancer. When sprinkled over a finished dish, it gives a pleasant taste sensation without being absorbed by the food. It is too good and too expensive to use for baking fish in it.</p>
