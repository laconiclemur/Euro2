<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0003487">This is a creamy, slow-cooked rice. Wild mushrooms have so much flavour, especially in autumn when many varieties are in season, and are used a lot in Basque cooking. One very typical dish is pan-fried ceps finished with olive oil, chopped parsley, salt and pepper, with an egg yolk on top.</p>
<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0003488">Though this recipe is simple, the mushrooms give the rice a real depth. The key here is making sure you cook the rice properly: I like it to be al dente, but if you prefer it with a little less bite, just add a splash more water and cook it for a bit longer – it won’t dilute the flavour.</p>
<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0003489">Don’t be scared to wash the black trumpet mushrooms: it’s the only way to clean them without ending up eating a load of dirt!</p>

<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0003505">Clean the mushrooms to get rid of any dirt or grit: some people use a brush, but I think the best way is to dab them carefully with a damp J-cloth. The exception to this is the black trumpets, which have a lot of mud inside them: put them in a colander under running water, then dry them gently on a cloth. Cut the ceps into ½cm slices, and leave the black trumpets and girolles whole (unless the latter are very large, in which case cut them in half).</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0003506">Put the olive oil into a large shallow casserole dish or sauté pan on a medium heat, then add the ceps and cook for a minute. Add the girolles next, and cook for another minute, then finally add the black trumpets – these will lose a lot of water. When all the water has evaporated (you will be able to hear when this happens, as the mushrooms will start to sizzle as they cook), add the garlic and shallots and season a little. Cook for a minute or so, then add the rice and bay leaves and season again. Stir together and cook for a couple of minutes, continuing to stir with a spoon, to remove the starch from the rice.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0003507"><a id="pg121" class="pcalibre calibre3"></a>Have your stock ready: you don’t want it boiling or it will reduce (if it does, just top it up with water), but it should be steaming.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0003508">Lower the heat to a gentle medium-low and add a quarter of the stock to the pan, stirring with a spoon. When this evaporates, add more. Make sure the heat is medium-low, otherwise the stock will evaporate too fast, without cooking the rice. Continue doing this, stirring frequently, until you have used all the stock. Taste the rice, and when you’re happy with its texture, sprinkle over the thyme and mix together.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0003509">Season again if necessary, and serve with shaved Manchego – if you’re lucky enough to have a truffle, that makes a luxurious extra finishing touch.</p>
