    <div class="line"> </div>
    <p class="nonindent1_break"><a id="page133"/><span class="C_COTX"><span class="dk_blue">There was no forest</span></span> surrounding <a id="ind217a"/>Eymundur Magnússon’s <a id="ind220a"/><a id="ind40a"/>barley farm on the shores of <a id="ind340a"/>Lake Lagarfljót in eastern Iceland. He had to grow his own. The dairy farmer turned organic farm pioneer who now owns <a id="ind382a"/>Modir Jord (Mother Earth), one of the most successful organic food companies in all of Iceland, started growing barley more than a quarter century ago.</p>
<p class="extract">At the time, no one was eating barley in Iceland. It shared a common tale of woe with other Icelandic resources: people assumed expensive imports were superior to their own products and ignored the potential around them. Eymundur made it his mission to convince Icelanders to eat their own barley once again, and along they way, he planted over one million trees on his little slice of nirvana called <a id="ind629a"/>Vallanes Farm.</p>
<p class="extract">The farmer’s shock of red hair hints at the Celtic lineage that runs in the veins of many Icelanders, and his soft-spoken nature mirrors that of most of his countrymen. When Icelanders told him he was crazy to plant barley, he quietly continued his work, seed by seed, tree by tree. Now that his forest surrounds him, he has started building trails through the trees so that visitors can wander around in his paradise.</p>
<p class="extract">As they meander through the birch forest, they might catch a glimpse of “the monster house,” the canteen in which aspiring farmers who flock to Vallanes from around the world enjoy three meals a day made from produce freshly harvested from the fields. Eymundur prefers to bike around his massive farm, where in the summer the sun bathes the barley stalks in a shimmering gold. He is a self-made man who is happy to share his bounty and his wisdom with others—over a bowl of barley, of course.</p>
<h2 class="A2" id="c06-s39"><a id="page134"/><span class="dk_blue">A Conversation with Barley Farmer Eymundur Magnússon</span></h2>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Do chefs like Gunnar inspire you?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">We work together and inspire each other. It’s rewarding to see my products being used by chefs I admire like Gunnar. Seeing his excitement for my work and knowing he supports it helps me keep going. In the end, it doesn’t matter how good the product is if a chef or home cook doesn’t use it properly. There’s no salvation for it.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Do you find that Icelanders know what to do with what you produce?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">At first they didn’t, and it was very frustrating. During my grandmother’s generation, barley was typically used in a preparation similar to gruel. It wasn’t appetizing and the barley flavor was lost during the long cooking. People didn’t have a fondness for barley because of it, and it was hard to convince them to try my barley.</p>
<p class="Answer">I started selling it at a local market, and people who I convinced to try it would report back to me the next week that it tasted the same in their gruel as it always did. It was frustrating to know that they were still preparing it in the same tired way, and I really had to make an effort to show people how to showcase my barley in its best light. I started preparing dishes at my stand for people to try, and eventually I won them over by convincing them to start cooking the barley in a lighter, healthier way.</p>
<p class="Answer">No one was eating barley in Iceland twenty years ago. Today Icelanders consume over sixty tons of it annually, and much of it is mine. There was a long tradition here of eating rice, which makes absolutely no sense at all. But for a long time, Icelanders always thought imports were superior to local resources, and I now love hearing from my customers that they have replaced rice with barley. Today my barley is for sale in stores throughout Iceland, and I am very proud of this. Icelandic barley is some of the best in the world, and knowing I contributed to its return is very gratifying.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> What makes it the best?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">Our growing season is short, and even during the spring and summer, it takes a lot of time for vegetables and grains to grow because the weather is always slightly cold here, even at the height of summer. This slow growing gives the plants time to build flavor, and by the time they’re harvested, they are packed with it. I might be biased, but I truly do believe our barley is some of the best in the world. It has a sweet, nutty taste that you can’t find in other barleys.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> <a id="page135"/>What other products do you make?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">We make chutneys, jams, pancake mixes, crackers, vegetable burgers, and many other products that are for sale throughout Iceland. Icelandic people eat oat porridge instead of barley porridge, and I’m now working on trying to convince them to switch from oats to barley. My wife is instrumental in this. We married in 2010. She’s been working in the food business for several years and was the founder of <a id="ind579a"/>Slow Food in Iceland, so she was very lucky to find an organic farmer, and I was very lucky to find her.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> How many trees have you planted at <a id="ind630a"/>Vallanes?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">I’ve planted over one million trees on my property. When I started farming here over twenty-five years ago, people told me I was crazy. The elevation is high here, and they told me there wasn’t enough oxygen to sustain a healthy farm. So, I told them that I would have to make my own, and that’s why I started planting trees. When you look out over the property now, most of the trees that you see were planted by me and my family. If you ask me at the end of my lifetime what I am proudest of, I will say reintroducing barley to Iceland and growing my own forest.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> How did the economic collapse affect your barley sales?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">People say you should eat what grows in the same environment where you live, and it makes perfect sense. After the economic collapse, my barley sales jumped 50 percent, since Icelanders could no longer afford to purchase expensive imports. At first they bought it out of necessity, but now they do it because they want to. We have always been proud of being Icelandic, but we didn’t see the value in the things we can grow here. Now we do.</p>
<p class="Answer">When I sell in <a id="ind500a"/>Reykjavík, people come up to me and thank me for what I’m doing, and that is extremely gratifying. I feel like a pioneer who works hard to make his dreams come true. I’m very happy with my work, and I love that people also enjoy and appreciate it. We now invite people to come from around the world to stay at the farm, to learn about our work, to walk along the trails that we have created through our forest. People are used to walking on concrete. Here they walk on untouched land and run their fingers through the barley. For me, there is nothing more satisfying.</p>

<div class="yield">MAKES 1 GENEROUS CUP (240 ML) <span class="yield_pipe">|</span> PREPARATION TIME: ABOUT 25 MINUTES</div>
<div class="headnote">Spring is the time to revel in the sunshine after a harsh winter. This recipe celebrates the spring vegetables that emerge on farms and <a id="ind185a"/>gardens throughout Iceland after a long, dark season. Guests enjoy watching Gunnar harvest the baby vegetables from his raised gardens just outside the front window of Dill, and sometimes they are even invited to pick their own vegetables. Dressed up with a cheerful green herb mayonnaise, this recipe is the perfect way to greet the spring.</div>
<div class="ingredient">
<p class="IL_head_top"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>HERB MAYONNAISE (<span class="IL_font"><em>see</em></span> NOTES)</strong></span></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>½ cup (50 g) fresh young angelica leaves</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>½ cup (50 g) fresh <a id="ind141a"/><a id="ind597a"/>Spanish chervil leaves (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c06_r1.htm#c06-note25">see notes</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>¼ cup (25 g) fresh lovage leaves</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1½ cups (360 ml) rapeseed oil</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1 egg yolk</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>2 teaspoons Dijon mustard</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Salt</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong><a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-sec1">Beer Vinegar</a>, for seasoning</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>2 tablespoons sour cream</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>New small vegetables, any variety, raw, trimmed and peeled if necessary</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">To make the mayonnaise, prepare an ice bath. Put the angelica, chervil, lovage, and oil in a blender and process on high speed for 6 to 8 minutes, until steaming hot and the herbs are fully incorporated into the oil. Strain through cheesecloth or a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, forcing out as much oil from the herb mass as possible so no flavor is lost. You should have about 1 cup (240 ml). Nest the bowl in the ice bath until the oil is well chilled.</div>
<div class="method">Put the egg yolk and mustard in a blender and process just until blended. With the motor running on medium speed, add the herb oil in a slow, steady drizzle. When about half of the oil has been added and the mixture has begun to emulsify, you can begin to add the remaining oil slightly faster, processing for about 6 to 8 minutes total, until a thick mayonnaise forms. Alternatively, make the mayonnaise by hand: In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolk and mustard until blended. Then, whisking constantly, slowly add the herb oil, drop by drop, until the mixture begins to thicken. Add the remaining oil in a slow, steady stream while whisking vigorously, until a thick mayonnaise forms. Season the mayonnaise with salt and vinegar, whisking until incorporated. Cover and refrigerate until chilled.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, whisk the sour cream into the mayonnaise. Serve a small bowl of mayonnaise alongside the vegetables. Keep this dish as unadulterated and wild as you can. It is a celebration of spring and, in this case as in most, the season knows best.</div>

<div class="yield">MAKES ABOUT 1½ PINTS (720 ML) <span class="yield_pipe">|</span> PREPARATION TIME: ABOUT 30 MINUTES</div>
<div class="headnote">Angelica flourishes nearly everywhere in Iceland, and its large, hollow stalks are perfect for pickling. When the pickled stalks are thinly sliced, they yield miniature rings that are wonderful sprinkled on fish, salads, or vegetables for a burst of taste and color. Gunnar uses pickled angelica frequently in his dishes, and should you be able to source it fresh, this recipe is highly recommended for its versatility and flavor.</div>
<div class="ingredient">
<p class="IL_item"><strong>9 ounces (250 g) angelica stalks with their seeds</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>2 cups (480 ml) distilled white vinegar</strong></p>

<p class="IL_item"><strong>4 teaspoons sea salt</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">Combine the stalks, seeds, and vinegar in a small saucepan and bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Remove from the heat, add the sugar and salt, and stir until dissolved. Let cool to room temperature.</div>
<div class="method">Transfer to a glass jar, cap tightly, and refrigerate until chilled. Use the stalks, seeds, and pickling juice to add zing to recipes. The angelica will keep in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.</div>

It’s a butter <a id="ind100a"/>service to remember, especially when served with warm rye bread baked in-house. The color of the angelica butter is mossy green, and because of the pickled flavor, it’s a feisty addition to sandwiches or served on top of fresh-from-the-grill steak.</div>

<div class="headnote">The potatoes cultivated in eastern Iceland are some of the best grown in the country. In this recipe, they are both pureed and boiled and then paired with pickled shallots. In keeping with his reduce-waste philosophy, Gunnar frequently employs what he calls “grill oil” in his recipes. This is oil that has already been used to cook something, which means that it is filled with tasty browned bits. When it is used in a new recipe, it imparts a deep, nutty flavor to the dish. Once you try reusing oil in this manner, you will never want to throw away your grill oil again. It can be collected as you cook and stored in an airtight container (in order to prevent it from imparting its flavor to other items) in the refrigerator. Gunnar recommends sheep tallow for this recipe. But since sheep tallow will prove almost impossible to source, lard or rendered duck fat make good substitutes.</div>

    <div class="headnote">The original version of this recipe calls for <a id="ind489a"/>reindeer liver, a luxury item in Iceland because hunting reindeer is regulated by a strict and <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c06_r1.htm#c06-eass12">limited lottery system</a>. Reindeer herds flourish in the eastern part of the country and sightings are common against a backdrop of retreating glaciers and icebergs making their way to sea. Although the reindeer liver Gunnar prepares at Dill is rich and flavorful, it is also difficult to source, so calf’s liver is substituted here. It is paired with kale, cabbage puree, and an herb puree, making it an ideal dish for a cold winter’s eve when you just might be thinking about reindeer pulling a heavily laden sleigh across the sky.</div>

<p class="Essays_nonindent">It’s hard to grow vegetables in many parts of Iceland because of the amount of lava in the soil and the short growing season, but Icelanders have devised a way to grow vegetables year-round. Throughout the countryside, greenhouses are a common feature, lighting up the long winter nights like neon-yellow spaceships. They are fueled by geothermal electricity and the plants are usually watered with geothermal water, making these greenhouses nearly 100 percent sustainable operations.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent"><a id="ind253a"/>Fridheimar is on the tourist route of the <a id="ind260a"/>Golden Circle, which is about an hour from <a id="ind501a"/>Reykjavík. The famed three- hour drive includes Iceland’s iconic waterfall <a id="ind280a"/>Gullfoss; its geyser field <a id="ind256a"/>Geysir (after which all other geysers around the world are named); and <a id="ind626a"/>Thingvellir, which up until a century ago was the gathering spot of Iceland’s government, until it relocated to Reykjavík (Iceland bears the distinction of having the longest continuously running government in the world). If all these impressive sights are not enough, there is Fridheimar, one of the best places to witness geothermal greenhouses. The family-owned operation grows organic tomatoes that have become fixtures on Icelandic supermarket shelves. The tomatoes are also transformed into jams, Bloody Mary mix, and soups that can be purchased to take home or sampled in Fridheimar’s welcoming café, right in the center of one of the greenhouses.</p>

<div class="headnote">Pine trees are much more common in eastern Iceland than anywhere else in the country, and Gunnar frequently incorporates their needles into his recipes. They impart the flavor of strong juniper and are a festive ingredient to use during the winter holiday season. After sourcing your pine twigs from a nearby tree, rinse them well under cold running water to rid them of any sap and residue, then dry them well before using. Pine is called for three times in this recipe, and when paired with the tangy buttermilk ice cream and the tartness of the cider apples, it creates a unique flavor profile that your guests will love, especially on a cold, dark winter’s night when everyone’s mood needs lightening.</div>

</div>
<div class="method">To make the ice cream, prepare an ice bath. Combine the cream, sugar, and glucose in a saucepan over low heat and stir until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat, add the gelatin, and stir until dissolved. Add the buttermilk and process with an immersion blender until smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Nest the bowl in the ice bath and let stand until chilled, stirring occasionally. Transfer to an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Scoop into an airtight container, place in the freezer, and freeze for about 12 hours, until solid.</div>
<div class="method"><a id="page151"/>To make the cake, preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Butter a 9 by 5-inch (23 by 12-cm) loaf pan. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whip attachment, combine the eggs and brown sugar and beat on high speed until frothy. Add the oil in a slow, steady stream, beating until incorporated. In a bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the egg mixture and stir until incorporated. Transfer the batter to the loaf pan.</div>
<div class="method">Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until golden brown and a cake tester inserted into the center comes out dry. Let cool in the pan on a wire rack to room temperature, then turn out of the pan.</div>
<div class="method">To make the cider apples, preheat an immersion circulator to 147°F (64°C). Combine all of the ingredients in a vacuum bag and seal on the highest setting. Cook in the circulator for 20 minutes, until the apples are tender. Meanwhile, prepare an ice bath. When the apples are ready, transfer the bag to the ice bath until chilled. Remove the apple halves from the bag and cut into thirds. As an alternative to the immersion circulator, place the apples in a pot and add enough apple cider to cover the apples. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, reduce heat to medium, and simmer until the apples are tender, about 12 minutes.</div>
<div class="method">To make the apple foam, combine about one-third of the apple cider and the superfine sugar in a saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves.</div>
<div class="method">Add the remaining apple juice, the citric acid, and the soy lecithin and stir until dissolved. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Just before serving, process with an immersion blender until frothy.</div>
<div class="method">To make the pine tree oil, combine the needles and oil in a food processor and process on high speed for about 8 minutes, until smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl and season with salt. Transfer to a squeeze bottle. The oil will keep in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.</div>
<div class="method">To make the pine tree powder, combine the maltodextrin, salt, and liquid glucose in a food processor and process while adding the oil in a slow, steady stream. Continue to process until a powder forms. Transfer to an airtight container and store at room temperature until ready to use. The powder will keep at room temperature for up to 1 week.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, break the cake up into pieces and arrange some pieces on a plate. Place a scoop of the ice cream and a spoonful of the apples alongside the cake and drizzle with the oil. Spoon the foam on top of everything and sprinkle with pine tree powder.</div>

<div class="headnote">Gunnar’s desserts are rarely heavy, and this recipe, showcasing farmer <a id="ind218a"/>Eymundur Magnússon’s barley, is the perfect example of his use of vegetables in desserts, a practice that prevents the jarring contrast that sometimes occurs when moving from a savory course to a sugary dessert. The barley is nutty and crunchy, adding a nice counterpoint to the bright flavor and smooth texture of the sorbet and the tanginess of the skyr. If you like, carrot or cucumber can be substituted for the fennel.</div>

<div class="method">To make the sorbet, prepare an ice bath. Combine one-fourth of the fennel juice, the sugar, the glucose, and the salt in a saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Add the vinegar and the remaining fennel juice and mix well. Remove from the heat, nest the pan in the ice bath, and let stand stand until chilled, stirring occasionally. Transfer to an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Scoop into an airtight container, place in the freezer, and freeze for about 4 hours, until frozen solid.</div>
<div class="method">To make the frothy skyr, combine the cream and sugar in a saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved.

In a saucepan, combine the barley, sugar, salt, and 2½ cups (600 ml) of the water and bring to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring frequently, for about 30 minutes, until all of the water has evaporated. The barley should be almost fully tender. If it is not, add a little more water and continue cooking. When the barley is ready, transfer it to the prepared baking sheet, spread in an even layer, and let cool to room temperature.</div>
<div class="method">In a heavy pot, heat the oil to 350°F (180°C). Add the barley a handful at a time and fry, stirring constantly to prevent scorching, for 10 to 15 seconds, until golden brown. Don’t worry if the barley clumps together. Once it has cooled, it will be easy to break the clumps apart. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the barley to paper towels to drain.
