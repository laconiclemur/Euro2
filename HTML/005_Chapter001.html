  <p class="noindent"><span class="small">I WILL NEVER FORGET</span> the day I held my first finished cookbook in my hands. It was like holding my newborn for the first time. I had a feeling of having made something that would last and live on forever. After that first book, things took off at lightning speed. I wrote a book a year for the next five years. Those first two books sold more than a million copies combined. Incredible to say the least! There were mile-long lines outside the bookstores where I was signing, and I remember sitting and writing “Merry Christmas from Tina” until my fingers were throbbing with pain.</p>

  <p class="indent">My sixth “child” has taken some years to complete, but it’s the most comprehensive book I have written yet. It’s deliciously thick and sturdy, with its own distinct personality. It’s not your typical, basic cookbook, although it does contain many classic recipes and foundations. Rather, I see it as a milestone. It contains the recipes I’ve carried with me and developed over the years; I consider it to be my foundation. Thus far, that is. Many of the flavors are from my childhood, but just as many come from other kitchens and traditions—even if I’ve given them my own interpretation. This book is a tasting key to my own kitchen!</p>

  <p class="noindent1"><a id="page_8"/>The recipes for this book were written, tested, and photographed in a very special place. Ever since 2009, I’ve been renting this beautiful 19th century house at Ramlösa Park outside Helsingborg in the south of Sweden. This house is very special to me because I grew up in it as the child to a pair of restaurant owners! My current office is in my parents’ old bedroom. From my office window, I can look out over Ramlösa Park, where I ran wild as a child, where I peed my pants, lost my teeth, fell in love, and broke up with boyfriends.</p>

  <p class="indent">It’s an important place for me, and not simply because my roots and my professional foundation are so incredibly entwined here (something I didn’t fully realize until this book was photographed and completed). It’s in this environment, on these worn-out wooden floors, that I renew my strength and energy. This somewhat ramshackle old house that holds so many memories for me ended up being the obvious backdrop for the photographs and the recipes for this book. I hope it has given this book a soul. This place makes me creative. This is where I have the people around me that I trust the most. Family and friends visit all the time, and I always have a pot of coffee brewing for anyone who shows up at my doorstep.</p>

  <p class="indent">My parents, Gudrun and Björn Nordström, bought Ramlösa Tavern when I was a baby. Back in the day, fine ladies and gentlemen came to the springs at Ramlösa to drink straight from the source. My parents bought the tavern in 1974, and two years later, Mom and Dad acquired the Ramlösa Spring Hotel. It was an enormous investment. I was three years old at the time, and my brother, Peter, was five. There was a little pink house next to Ramlösa Tavern <a id="page_9"/>that once served as a makeshift cell for drunks who couldn’t make it home after a night out; this was renovated, and my grandparents moved in. My grandfather worked the bar at the restaurant, kept track of the liquor inventory, and mixed the <span class="italic">Glögg</span> for Christmas. My grandmother was the epicenter of the family and the safe haven to which we kids ran for comfort. She was the one who helped us with our homework and the one to take us to gymnastics or soccer practice. And she was the one who cooked the most amazing day-to-day dishes. Sure, our dad’s food was great, but that we considered to be more along the lines of “delicacies.” Regular, everyday meals, such as green cabbage soup, and “custard,” were grandma’s territory.</p>

  <p class="caption"><span class="italic">My brother and I were almost always at Grandma and Grandpa’s since Mom and Dad had to work almost all the time. Here are two letters, one written by my dad and the other by my grandma. The letter from Dad humbly asks if my brother and I may join him and my mother for an outing to Gothenburg with the family. My grandmother replies that it is okay for us to go but that next time she would appreciate if she could be notified earlier, not on the day of!</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_12"/>The spring at Ramlösa is still active, and when you drink the water right by the rocks, it tastes like minerals and iron—almost like sucking on a nail. As a child, I used to play with the mineral deposits and wrote rust-colored messages on the walls.</p>

  <p class="noindent1">When it’s your job to stir up other people’s appetites, it’s important to guard your own. One way I do this—besides being in my favorite place on Earth—is to cook under the most simple of conditions. Many people are surprised when they see my professional kitchen and realize that it’s as far from a sterile laboratory with cool machinery and shiny surfaces as you can get. There are no induction cooking ranges, large stainless steel kitchen appliances, or even a dishwasher. There is, however, an old electric stove and a tired, old bread maker. The coal filter fan makes noises, fuses blow, and the lighting could be better. But when I’m here, I do my best work, and this is where all my recipes for <a id="page_13"/>this book were created. I also have confidence that when I turn my recipes over to you, they’ll work no matter what your kitchen looks like! If the recipe works in my Ramlösa kitchen, it will work in the most simplistic kitchen out there—because it’s surely been tested in the direst of circumstances, just to guarantee that it will hold up under even the worst-case scenarios!</p>

  <p class="noindent1">I truly hope that this book will be a staple tool in your kitchen, along with a great pepper mill and a really sharp knife. It should be placed right in the middle of the kitchen counter, it should be covered in sauce stains and embedded with thumbprints, and preferably some personal notations in the margins.</p>

  <p class="indent">I also want this book to be as honest and true as possible. The pictures should exude the flavor of the dishes, and every item on the plate should be there for a reason. If the dish is brown, the picture should show it as brown. No fuss, but rather an honest book without any glitz.</p>

  <p class="indent">It makes me happy to know that you are holding my book in your hands right at this moment, and I’m so proud that it’s become such a substantial book to hold onto. I truly hope it will serve you well in your kitchen and that you find many new favorite recipes to cook often—because if this book ends up in the living room, I’ve failed completely!</p>
