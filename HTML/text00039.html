</h1>
<p class="pf">Nobody ever told me in so many words that my stories were or were not important. Perhaps by default, I have always felt that they were not. Yet ever since I was a young girl, even feeling this way, I have wanted to write. I’ve wanted to tell my stories. There seemed to be something magical about a blank piece of paper. I remember as a child being sick and confined to bed. The very best medicine anyone could give me then was a pad of paper and a pencil. I wrote poems and short stories, but I never dared let anybody see them.</p>
<p>Buried in boxes in the cluttered attic of our garage is a cloth-covered folder of my stories labeled “the works of Beatrice A. Luoma, age 15” that I had long ago laid to rest. I haven’t opened the folder since, even though it was moved from one home to another in boxes of things that I didn’t know what to do with. I don’t even know why I saved it, but I just could not throw it away. In the box are stacks of rejection slips from <i>Calling All Girls</i>
 and <i>Seventeen</i>
 magazine clipped to the stories I had submitted hopefully and that routinely came back to me without so much as a handwritten signature. When I went to retrieve them from the upstairs of the garage, I found that the squirrels had made nests in the boxes and chewed all my precious papers to shreds.</p>
<p>Little glimmers of hope: essays and stories written as requirements of passage from one high school English class to another, pieces that usually came back marked with an A or an A minus. I assumed that was because most of my classmates hated to write and probably didn’t do the assignments.</p>
<p>It was a young high school English teacher who, along with Tom Jacobson, the band director, and Tom Riley, the science teacher, convinced me that I really needed to go to college. It wasn’t the usual thing a kid from Floodwood did at the time. Somehow, they found a hundred-dollar scholarship for me that was renewable for each of my four years of college. The money covered each year’s tuition and student fees. In addition, I landed three part-time jobs at the university that covered my room and board, and I even earned enough money to send some home. Dorothy, the valedictorian of my class in Floodwood, who seemingly had no other ambition than to get married to her boyfriend and have babies, was offered full-ride scholarships to a number of colleges. I in turn had been offered a good-paying job at the Floodwood First State Bank, which I rejected. Counting money has never been my thing.</p>
<p>I ended up in the home economics department of the University of Minnesota Duluth, thinking I could squeeze in some of the creative writing classes that I lusted for. But home economics at that time was a terribly time-consuming course, with long labs where we learned skills like hat blocking and tailoring. The cooking labs were silly courses in which we boiled onions for two hours and then had to figure out why they were tasteless. I almost flunked the personal grooming class because I refused to wear a girdle.</p>
<p>Dr. Ruth was the head of the home economics department, and any deviation in my course of study had to be approved by her. I asked to take a creative writing course, which meant I had to drop one of the home economics requirements. I didn’t mind tailoring and hat making, which were fun crafty classes and I really liked the teacher, but the education courses tested my endurance for pure monotony. I thought I could easily give up one of them.</p>

<p>Dr. Ruth called me into her office, where she presided behind her desk. A few papers neatly stacked to her left, my petition in front of her, a few well-sharpened pencils sticking out of a pottery mug on her right. Behind her was an original painting—an abstract. She liked to appear a patron of the arts. She was also in the middle of an affair with the head of the industrial arts department whose family lived just outside of town. I don’t suppose his wife knew anything about it.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Be-atrice” (she always pronounced my name Be-atrice, although everybody else called me Peaches). She tipped her forehead forward, her eyes thin slits, as she stretched her thin lips across her nicotine-stained teeth. There was a space wide enough between her two front teeth to hold a cigarette.</p>
<p>She had dark, wavy hair that she pulled back into a bun and the lapel of her expensively tailored suit held a lovely designer silver sculpture.</p>
<p>Dr. Ruth grew up in Buffalo and I thought she acted like one. Her PhD was from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, which I associated with bugs (the Finnish word for “insect” is <i>itikka</i>
).</p>
<p>It did not take long to see that my wish was not going to be granted if I wanted to graduate on schedule. It did not take long, either, to realize that her disappointment in me was about the same as a farmer’s when a cow doesn’t produce. She counted the graduates as prizes, as she probably had promised me to fill one of the positions posted for home economics teachers.</p>
<p>“You have an obligation,” she began, “to pay back your debt to society.” She knew that I was engaged to be married shortly after my graduation. My fiancé, Dick, had been in ROTC and was stationed in England. Our plan was that he would fly home to attend the graduation, we’d get married, and then we would live in Oxford for a full year. She did not like that at all.</p>
<p>According to her, I was a leech on society. She told me that I would never grow up and that I would never need anything as frivolous as creative writing. I would have wasted my education.</p>
<p>There was no use arguing. The personal attacks I could handle, but what followed, I couldn’t: “You come from the kind of family that doesn’t know how to fold their sheets right.” Anybody else might have laughed, but one thing that Finnish mothers teach their daughters is how to properly fold their linens. I left in tears.</p>
<p>Dr. Ruth died several years later, reportedly the only person ever allowed to smoke in the Benedictine Health Center.</p>
