  <p class="chap-para">A light, simple potato dish, ideal to accompany roast meats – or it can be eaten as a meal by itself. The subtle taste of malt in the beer marries really well with the potatoes, onions and smoked bacon. This can be made a day in advance and reheated.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4–6</p>

  <p class="ing1">1kg/2lb 4oz potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">200ml/7fl oz/scant 1 cup lager beer</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 large onions, thinly sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">200g/7oz smoked bacon cubes</p>

  <p class="ing2">85g/3oz pecorino (romano) cheese, grated</p>

  <p class="para">Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6.</p>

  <p class="para">Put the potatoes in a large bowl and toss together with the beer, olive oil, salt and pepper.</p>

  <p class="para">Lift the potatoes out of the beer mixture and line the bottom of an ovenproof dish with a layer of potatoes, followed by a layer of sliced onions; sprinkle over a few cubes of bacon and some of the grated pecorino. Continue layering in the same way until all the ingredients are used, finishing with grated pecorino. Pour over the beer mixture, cover with foil and bake in the oven for 1 hour. Remove the foil and bake for another 30 minutes.</p>

  <p class="para1">Remove from the oven and leave to rest for a couple of minutes before serving.</p>
