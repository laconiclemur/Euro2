<p class="noindent1">“Abend ably describes the creative process of culinary genius and that pressure cooker of an environment, on a par with <span class="txit">Heat</span> by Bill Buford. Each paragraph is as captivating as one of Adrià’s little culinary gems—a mesmerizing and highly entertaining read.”</p>
<p class="right">—<span class="txit">The Austin Chronicle</span></p>
<p class="noindent1">“Abend draws a portrait of a disciplined and exacting place, free from the chaotic, abusive excesses made famous by Anthony Bourdain, yet intense in its own right.”</p>
<p class="right">—NPR</p>
<p class="noindent1">“Countless descriptions of an undeniably dazzling creative process and of foods that, even on paper, have the power to delight and amuse. A slow-motion gastronomical feast and a rare chance for gourmet enthusiasts to witness the creative process behind some of the world’s most innovative cuisine.”</p>
<p class="right">—<span class="txit">Kirkus Reviews</span></p>
<p class="noindent1">“An intimate glimpse of life as a stagiaire . . . Another dimension to the culinary legend that is elBulli.”</p>
<p class="right">—<span class="txit">Publishers Weekly</span></p>
<p class="noindent1">“Reads like a suspense novel at times. . . . The reader is able to relate to the characters, their dreams, trials, and tribulations like those of an engrossing fictional tale.”</p>
<p class="right">—Whippedtheblog.com</p>
<p class="noindent1">“Not only is one given a great understanding of what elBulli is all about; we can also clearly see the impact that the restaurant and its food has on aspiring chefs. Abend is successful in conveying the intense pressure felt by the young stagiaires, while providing insight into Ferran Adrià’s commanding but beneficent rule over his well-oiled machine of a kitchen.”</p>

<p class="noindent1"><a id="page_ii"/>“Captivating. . . . Abend’s storytelling is a breeze to read and the book is hard to put down.”</p>
<p class="right">—Cookingforengineers.com</p>
<p class="noindent1">“Abend’s book will astound you and make you feel as though you are actually an insider of the world’s greatest kitchen. You should definitely read this one! I cannot recommend it enough.”</p>
<p class="right">—KitchenConundrum.com</p>
<p class="noindent1">“No chef, or restaurant, has had a greater impact on modern cooking and eating than Ferran Adrià and his elBulli. Until now, though, the inner life of the restaurant seemed as closed and mysterious as Willy Wonka’s factory. Now, Lisa Abend opens all the doors, peeks in all the pots, talks to all the Oompa-Loompas, and generally gives us a unique, insider’s vision of an amazing place. In the history of writing about restaurants, there have been few books displaying more sensitivity, insight, sympathy, and wisdom about the strange life—half pure art, half pure lackey—of the modern cook.”</p>
<p class="right">—Adam Gopnik, author of <span class="txit">Paris to the Moon</span></p>
<p class="noindent1">“An illuminating new look at the most influential chef of our time through the kaleidoscopic lens of his thirty-five stagiaires. It’s a fascinating glimpse into a culinary rite of passage, and the incomparable genius behind it.”</p>
<p class="right">—Dan Barber, executive chef and co-owner of Blue Hill Farm</p>
<p class="noindent1">“Part Dalí, part Einstein, part modern-day Escoffier, superchef Ferran Adrià of elBulli is one of the greatest creative minds of our time. Lisa Abend’s formidable reportage, astute cultural observations, and keen eye for detail have produced a fascinating chronicle of the life-changing adventure undertaken by elBulli’s lucky band of kitchen apprentices.”</p>
<p class="right">—Anya von Bremzen, author of <span class="txit">The New Spanish Table</span></p>
<p class="noindent1"><a id="page_iii"/>“Lisa Abend’s new book reads like a Harry Potteresque version of a cook’s story and gives readers the chance to enter the hidden world of cooks.”</p>
<p class="right">—José Andrés, chef of Café Atlántico and The Bazaar, and star of the PBS show <span class="txit">Made in Spain</span></p>
<p class="noindent1">“A fascinating, well-reported, and dramatic account of life behind the lines at the world’s most renowned restaurant, elBulli [and] a full, clear picture of Ferran Adrià. . . . This is a worthy addition to the literature of the professional kitchen and a pleasure to read.”</p>
<p class="right">—Michael Ruhlman, author of <span class="txit">Ratio</span> and <span class="txit">The Making of a Chef</span></p>
