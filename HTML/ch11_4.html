<p class="noindenti"><span class="stickup">A</span>lthough I love to eat fish, I haven’t had much luck catching them, despite many expeditions with my father to the numerous reservoirs and streams near our town. One day we went to a bridge overlooking a reservoir where, we had been told, even small children were known to catch fish. As usual, we caught nothing. I suggested that we try our luck under the bridge, but again, no fish. As I gazed at the water in frustration I noticed what looked like a silver ladle resting on the bottom of the stream. I took off my shoes and socks, rolled up my pants, and pulled it out. It was a sterling silver ladle marked Black/Gorham/1890. My father polished it and now it is mounted like a trophy on a piece of cherrywood cut in the shape of a fish.</p>
<p class="indenti">We all know the benefits of eating fish—it’s an excellent source of low-calorie protein and it can be cooked so many different ways: poached, steamed, grilled, baked, or broiled. Here you will discover how to prepare seafood in healthy, simple, and extraordinary ways, all of which are unforgettable. Two of my favorites are Gianni’s baked whole fish and my father’s bluefish. Give them a try!</p>
