<p class="image"><a id="page_50"/><a id="page_51"/><img alt="image" src="../images/03fig00.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent">I am often asked how people can live in a place as cold as Norway. While I always feel slightly insulted by the question, it is indeed a very good one. How can people live in a country where the summer is no more than a short burst of ecstasy, a country of hills and mountains with less than 3 percent arable land, on the same latitude as Alaska?</p>
<p class="indent">The only answer I can think of is cod and potatoes—the gastronomical equivalent of luck and resilience.</p>
<p class="indent">The waters off the coast of western and northern Norway, where icy Arctic currents meet the warmer Gulf Stream, make an ideal breeding ground for cod. For centuries cod was one of the few commodities we had to offer the rest of the world. Cod, mackerel, herring, and animal hides were traded for wine, spices, books, and other luxuries that could make life in the high north more agreeable. This commerce linked Norway to the rest of Europe, culturally and economically, and gradually the modest <a id="page_54"/>trading posts along the coast grew into affluent cities like Bergen, Kristiansund, and Ålesund. Between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries, more than 60 percent of all the fish consumed in Europe was cod, a good portion coming from Norway.</p>
<p class="indent">In fact, when Norway became an important seafaring nation, it was the search for cod that triggered the first journeys to the west, first to Iceland, then to Greenland. Leif Eriksson “the Lucky,” the Norwegian-Icelandic Viking widely held to have been the first European to reach the shores of North America, was not looking for a continent to conquer. He had no great plans for building an empire. He was simply looking for new fishing grounds. He followed the cod from Iceland to Greenland, and farther still to North America (to what is now Labrador and Newfoundland). He named the new continent Vinland—“the Land of Wine”—probably referring to the cranberries that the Vikings used to make wine, in their short but animated stay on the American continent. After a few years of a steadily deteriorating relationship with the local Indians, the Vikings gave up and returned home. But while southern Europeans were arguing about whether there was anything other than an abyss on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, Scandinavian maps showed the country named Vinland far off to the west.</p>
<p class="indent">More than five hundred years after Eriksson’s “discovery,” a native American crop arrived in Scandinavia. The potato found a hungry people, struggling to survive, and fewer than two hundred years after its arrival, it had become the staple food of the entire region. Potatoes would grow in poor soil and did not seem to mind bad weather. They gave people one less thing to worry about, proving a much more nutritious, reliable, and high-yielding crop than grains and cereals.</p>
<p class="indent">Cod and potatoes are foods that encourage conservatism and experimentation, tradition and innovation. Both foods are nearly perfect as they are, and when they are served in all simplicity, few things can be better. Cod and potatoes can be subjected to infinite variations, served as a basic weekday supper or the pièce de résistance of a formal dinner.</p>

<div class="blue">
<p class="noindent"><small><strong>COOKING WITH TRUFFLES DEMANDS A FOIL THAT IS NOT TOO DOMINANT OR YOU WILL LOSE THE WONDERFUL COMPLEXITY OF AROMAS THAT YOU HAVE PAID SO MUCH FOR. COD, WITH ITS SUBTLE TASTE AND ITS APPEAL FROM TEXTURE AS MUCH AS FROM FLAVOR, IS JUST AS SUITABLE AS THE MORE COMMON OMELET OR PASTA.</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindentt"><small><strong>IF YOU CANNOT GET FRESH TRUFFLES, OR IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO SPLURGE ON THE REAL THING, A SPLASH OF TRUFFLE OIL WILL DO.</strong></small></p>
</div>
<p class="noindents">SERVES 4</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Four ½-pound cod fillets, skin on</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ cups veal stock or 1 cup chicken stock plus ½ cup beef stock</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 garlic cloves</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 bay leaf</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon truffle oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ ounce fresh black truffle</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Soak the fish in ice water for 15 to 20 minutes, or place it in a colander in the sink under cold running water for 15 to 20 minutes. Pat dry with paper towels.</p>
<p class="noindentt">In a small saucepan, bring the veal stock to a boil. Add the garlic and bay leaf and simmer gently until the garlic is soft and the veal stock is reduced to ⅓ cup, 15 to 20 minutes. Make sure the pot does not boil dry. Remove the garlic with a slotted spoon and set aside. Remove and discard the bay leaf.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Place the flour in a large dish and season with salt and pepper. Dredge the fish fillets in the flour. In a large nonstick skillet with a lid, heat 2 tablespoons of the butter over high heat. Add the fish, skin side up, and cook for 1 minute, then turn and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook for 6 minutes, or until the fish flakes nicely with a fork. Remove from the heat.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Meanwhile, add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and the truffle oil to the veal stock and heat over very low heat until the butter has melted; do not let boil. Add the reserved garlic.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Finely shave the truffle and scatter the shavings over the cod and into the cracks between the flakes of fish. Place the cod on warm plates. Drizzle with the garlic-veal glace and serve.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindent">We featured this dish on the <em>New Scandinavian Cooking</em> show from Lofoten, an archipelago in northern Norway that is the center of the Norwegian cod fisheries.</p>
<p class="noindentt">I did the cooking in a beautiful old storehouse for dried cod, and although the recipe is pretty straightforward, it was not so easy to do. The temperature was less than 30 degrees and every time we stopped for close-ups, the food started to freeze. It took a while to prepare, but I have never eaten better cod than what we had during that intense week.</p>

<p class="noindents">SERVES 4</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Four ½-pound cod fillets, skin on</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 pounds rutabaga, peeled and cut into 1-inch dice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 vanilla bean</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into pieces</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fine sea salt</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 very small sprigs fresh rosemary</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Soak the fish in ice water for 15 to 20 minutes, or place it in a colander in the sink under cold running water for 15 to 20 minutes. Pat dry with paper towels.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Preheat the oven to 400°F.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Bring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the rutabaga and cook for 25 to 30 minutes, until soft. Drain well.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Return the rutabaga to the pan to dry completely over low heat, 1 to 2 minutes. Puree the rutabaga in a food processor or pass it through a food mill, and return it to the pan. Cut the vanilla bean lengthwise in half. Scrape out the seeds and add to the mashed rutabaga. (Discard the bean or add it to a canister of sugar to make aromatic vanilla sugar.) Gently stir the butter into the mashed rutabaga until it melts. Season with a little salt. Keep warm.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Meanwhile, make a small incision through the skin of each cod fillet and gently insert a rosemary sprig. Season well with salt and pepper and rub with the olive oil. Place the fish in a roasting pan. Roast for about 15 minutes, until the fish flakes easily.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Place a large scoop of mashed rutabaga on each plate. Top with the fish and serve.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindent">Scandinavians love the turniplike rutabaga (whose American name is derived from the Swedish word for rutabaga). One of the few vegetables to last through the winter, it was long the food of the poor, cherished as an important source of vitamins more than for its taste. When I was growing up, our old neighbor, the ascetic and ever-worried Mrs. Krigel, lived on rutabaga and boiled water for weeks at a time. “It is pure, good food,” she insisted. “It will make you strong.” Every time I visited her, she would insist that I eat a slice of raw rutabaga. She was sure that the sweet taste would take my mind off the chocolate and chewing gum she suspected me of devouring. Of course it didn’t, and it was not until recently that I realized how wonderful this cheap, slightly sweet vegetable can be. Infused with the flavor of vanilla, it makes the most interesting contrast to lightly salted fresh cod.</p>
<p class="noindentt">The rutabaga can also be served with roast meats as an alternative to the somewhat plainer and more rustic Mashed Rutabaga (<a class="nounder" href="ch10.html#page_198">page 198</a>).</p>

<p class="noindentt">Crisscross the lemongrass stalks on a baking pan, making a rack for the fish. Place the fish on top of the lemongrass. Rub the right side of each steak with the turmeric and the left side with the saffron, so one half is bright yellow, the other orange-red. Roast for 10 to 12 minutes, until the flesh flakes easily.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Meanwhile, cut each pomegranate in half and remove the juicy seeds. In a large bowl, combine the pomegranate seeds, mangoes, shallots, brandy, and cilantro.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Divide the pomegranate-mango salad among four plates. Using a large spatula, place the fish on top, being careful to not let it fall apart (discard the lemongrass), and then serve.</p>

<p class="noindent">Cod roe is one of the great under-estimated and underused ingredients. If Russian caviar is the foie gras of the sea, then cod roe is the equivalent of prosciutto—lean, elegant, and flavorful.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Because of its plenitude, cod roe has always been quite cheap, and this may be one reason why it has never gained the recognition it deserves. In Norway, it has always been considered delicious but never viewed as a delicacy. It is usually served simply as an integral part of the annual cod feast in late February that marks the beginning of the codfishing season in northern Norway.</p>

<p class="noindent">The traditional way to prepare cod is to cook it in salty water and serve it with its liver and roe and Sandefjord butter sauce, a cream-and-butter sauce with parsley. Because of its almost brutal simplicity, this dish demands a lot from your fish. Only a whole extremely fresh fish caught in very cold waters will do. I do not love cod liver, so I sometimes omit it. The fish is accompanied by simple boiled potatoes and, contrary to more continental traditions, served with red wine. Serving it with Cucumber Salad (<a class="nounder" href="ch04.html#page_85">page 85</a>) would be a breach of tradition, but otherwise it is a fitting match.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_64"/>BACALAO: FAITHFUL STRANGER</h3>
<p class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/03fig06.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent">As a Norwegian, I find that traveling or meeting people from faraway countries normally means having to explain what and where Norway is, sometimes taking great pains to pronounce the name slowly and clearly, so people are not led to believe that I am from “Nowhere.” For some, the phonetic distinction between the two does not seem so important, but that is the price I have to pay for coming from a small, peaceful country tucked away far up north on the globe.</p>
<p class="indent">And yet there are times when I feel as though I come from a superpower, when people from far away surprise me with their immediate recognition and warm reception. “Ah, Norway/Noruega/Norvège,” they say, always followed by the explanation for their enthusiasm: “Bacalao/bacalhau/baccalà/morue/stockfish!” In Portugal, Spain, Brazil, Nigeria, Senegal, and parts of the Caribbean, Norwegian dried cod is considered one of the finest foods on earth.</p>
<p class="indent">Stockfish is cod that has been salted and dried, and therefore has a very long shelf life, much longer than the crudely dried unsalted cod. The particular method of salting and drying was introduced by the Dutch during the fifteenth century and was soon after adapted in Norway, Iceland, and Newfoundland. Dried cod had long been exported to parts of southern Europe, but as the Catholic Church started to enforce Lent and observe meatless days more vigorously, the demand for stockfish exploded. For centuries to come, dried salted cod was irreplaceable in most of the Catholic world. Between 1500 and 1800, 60 percent of all the fish consumed in Europe was cod, most of it dried, with a substantial share coming from Norway.</p>
<p class="indent">Contrary to what one might imagine, the dried fish is able to make sentiments run high. The Portuguese call the fish <em>fiel amigo,</em> “faithful friend,” and quarrel loudly about which of their more than three hundred <em>bacalhau</em> recipes is the best. In Nigeria, the military government of General Sani Abacha faced broad social unrest when it introduced a luxury tax on Norwegian stockfish, making it virtually inaccessible for poor people and exorbitantly priced for the upper classes. And in Cuba, where <a id="page_65"/>there is no longer the buying power for large-scale imports, I have friends who have traded a box of Cohiba cigars for a five-pound stockfish.</p>
<p class="indent">But as the Norwegian stockfish conquered the world, it remained a stranger in its own country, something to be relied upon as an important source of income but hardly ever eaten. It was not until the 1860s, when a boom in Norwegian-Spanish trade brought hordes of Spanish sailors and merchants to the western Norwegian towns of Kristiansund and Ålesund, the most important stockfish trading cities, that Norwegians first learned the true taste of bacalao, prepared with the most un-Norwegian of ingredients: tomatoes, pimientos, chiles, and olive oil. By the end of the century, when trade with Spain had diminished, the people of western Norway had adopted the bacalao as their own; some even eat it on Christmas Eve. In the rest of the country, however, bacalao has remained an oddity, something exotic eaten only by southern Europeans and the temperamental northwesterners from Ålesund and Kristiansund.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_71"/>POTATOES: HUMBLE TUBERS</h3>
<p class="image"><a id="page_70"/><img alt="image" src="../images/03fig09.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent">To my ninety-seven-year-old grandmother, nothing can be more perfect than a boiled potato. Whenever I make dinner for her, she is, despite her age, always curious to sample whatever new tastes I have brought home with me from my travels. She says it gives her a chance to partake in my journeys and sample the flavors of places she will never see. But, as is so often the case with traveling, the best thing is returning home. When she has finished her serving, she will compliment me, in her mild, generous manner, for showing her something new that she did not know existed. Then she will, with a smile, help herself to a boiled potato, peel it carefully but with surprising speed, and eat it with a big lump of butter. Seeing her contentment as she slowly eats the potato, I realize that no food can satisfy her more.</p>
<p class="indent">Potatoes have been a staple food in Norway for three centuries, and the cornerstone of almost every traditional Norwegian meal. Dinner would not be dinner without potatoes, and in an absurd attempt to make the new and exotic seem less intimidating, some of the first restaurants in Norway to serve spaghetti included a few boiled potatoes on the side.</p>
<p class="indent">Despite the introduction of pasta and rice, the potato still reigns. There are annual competitions to determine what varieties are best, from the small almond potatoes growing in the dry mountainous inland regions and the large, starchy Beate potatoes to the sweet, beautifully colored Golden Eye potatoes grown in northern Norway. Serving potatoes with almost every meal can be demanding for the cook, and although I by no means follow the rule that Norwegian food must be served with potatoes, I try to use the tradition as a challenge to discover the different qualities and the complexity of the humble tuber, from the luxury of a velvety smooth potato and garlic puree to the lightness of a new potato salad with chanterelles to the sweet comfort of caramelized potatoes.</p>

<div class="blue">
<p class="noindent"><small><strong>A LUXURIOUS POTATO DISH, IF EVER THERE WAS ONE. POTATO GRATIN IS A GOOD SIDE WITH ALMOST ANY MEAT, POULTRY, OR GAME DISH. RUTABAGA AND PARSNIPS (OR POSSIBLY SOME SWEET POTATO) ADD SWEETNESS AND FLAVOR.</strong></small></p>
</div>
<p class="noindents">SERVES 6</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2½ pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into ¼-inch slices</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound parsnips, peeled and cut into ¼-inch slices</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound rutabaga or sweet potato, peeled and cut into ¼-inch slices</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 bay leaves, preferably fresh, cut into 4 pieces</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 to 3 garlic cloves, cut lengthwise in half</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 cups whole milk</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup heavy (whipping) cream</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon salt</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup grated melting cheese, such as Gruyère</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Preheat the oven to 300°F.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Put the potatoes, parsnips, and rutabaga in a baking dish and toss to mix. Insert the bay leaves and garlic throughout the vegetables.</p>
<p class="noindentt">In a small bowl, combine the milk and cream. Season with the nutmeg and salt and pepper to taste. Mix in half the cheese and pour the mixture over the potatoes.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Bake for 1 hour. Sprinkle with the rest of the cheese, turn the heat up to 350°F, and bake for 15 to 20 more minutes, until the cheese is nice and brown and the potatoes are tender.</p>

<div class="blue">
<p class="noindent"><small><strong>THIS DISH GOES WELL WITH MOST MEATS.</strong></small></p>
</div>
<p class="noindents">SERVES 4 TO 6</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 slices pancetta or bacon, cut into ½-inch dice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons olive oil, if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 large russet potatoes, cut lengthwise into 4 wedges each</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 to 2 bay leaves</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ pound portobello or button mushrooms, trimmed, cleaned, and cut into ¼-inch slices</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Fry the pancetta in a large nonstick skillet until crisp. Remove it with a slotted spoon and set aside. If there is more than 1 tablespoon fat left in the pan, you will not need any olive oil; if not, add the oil. Add the potatoes to the pan. Crush the bay leaves in your hand and sprinkle them over the potatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Fry the potatoes over medium heat for 15 to 20 minutes, turning them from time to time to ensure that they cook evenly, until golden brown and tender.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Sauté the mushrooms for 3 to 4 minutes, or until tender. Season with salt and pepper and the thyme.</p>
<p class="noindentt">In a large bowl, toss the mushrooms, potatoes, and pancetta to mix. Serve.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><strong><small>VARIATION:</small></strong> I like the way the potatoes taste when they are pan-roasted, but if you want, you can bake them instead. Place the potatoes in a roasting pan or large baking dish, toss with the fat, and season them as above. Bake at 400°F for 30 minutes, or until golden brown and tender.</p>

THE TRADITIONAL RECIPE CALLS FOR NOTHING BUT POTATOES, BUTTER, AND SUGAR. I GENERALLY ADD A LITTLE BIT OF THYME, PREFERABLY LEMON THYME, TO GIVE THE POTATOES SOMETHING OTHER THAN JUST SWEETNESS.</strong></small></p>
</div>
<p class="noindents">SERVES 4 TO 6</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 pounds very small new potatoes, cooked in boiling salted water until tender, drained, and peeled, if desired</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon salt</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon chopped fresh lemon thyme or other thyme</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">In a large nonstick skillet, melt the butter over low to medium-low heat. Stir in the sugar and cook until melted and light brown, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon to make sure the sugar does not burn. Add only as many potatoes as will fit without crowding the pan, season with salt and thyme, and cook, shaking the pan constantly to make sure the potatoes are coated on all sides, until slightly browned and caramelized. (You can gently push the potatoes around in the pan, but make sure not to break them.) Transfer the potatoes to a serving platter and cover to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining potatoes and serve immediately.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><strong><small>VARIATION:</small></strong> When I serve these potatoes with game, I add 2 crushed juniper berries to the caramel, and when I serve them with lamb, I sprinkle the potatoes with a little finely chopped fresh dill just before serving. Adding a little bit of chopped garlic can be good when serving them with beef or chicken.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindent">If possible, try to find potatoes that are no bigger than walnuts. I wash the potatoes thoroughly but normally peel them only if the skin is very rough.</p>

<p class="noindentt">Meanwhile, cook the beans in lightly salted boiling water for 4 to 5 minutes, until just tender. Drain. Add the beans to the warm potatoes, then add the herbs, garlic, capers, and lemon zest. Combine the oil and lemon juice in a measuring cup, pour over the potato salad, and toss to mix well. Season with salt and pepper. Let stand for a few hours at room temperature so that the herbs will have time to flavor the potatoes. Sprinkle with edible flowers, if desired, just before serving.</p>
