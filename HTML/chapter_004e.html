<h2 class="h2b">PIGEONS ROTIS AUX CEPES ET POMMES DE TERRE</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Roasted Pigeon, Grilled Ceps and Potatoes</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>Farm-fattened, corn-fed pigeon is the most moreish of meats. Perfect when cooked pink, it holds up to the most robust of flavours. In the chill winter of Provence (yes, it does happen) we get rewarded after a little rain with sunshine and ceps, and these hearty mushrooms make a perfect partner for the pigeon</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
4 corn-fed pigeons, 450g (1lb) each<br/>
4 tbsp vegetable oil<br/>
1 medium onion, peeled and sliced<br/>
2 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced<br/>
150ml (5fl oz) Madeira<br/>
30g (1¼ oz) dried ceps, soaked in 300ml (10fl oz) warm water<br/>
1 tsp cornflour, diluted in 2 tbsp water (if necessary)<br/>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>
800g (1lb 12oz) medium new potatoes, washed, cut into 2cm (¾ in) slices and parboiled<br/>
8 medium fresh ceps, cleaned, wiped and halved<br/>
2 tbsp unsalted butter<br/>
4 sprigs dried savory or thyme, crushed</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 190°C/375°F/Gas 5.</p>
<p class="normala">Remove the necks, wishbones and winglets from the pigeons, just leaving the supreme attached to the top of the breast. Truss the pigeons and set aside.</p>
<p class="normala">Fry the pigeon trimmings in half the vegetable oil until golden and caramelised. Add the sliced onion and garlic and fry, stirring regularly, for about 10 minutes until golden brown. Drain off any excess fat, add the Madeira and reduce by two-thirds. Add the dried ceps with their soaking liquor, bring to the boil and simmer for half an hour. Strain the sauce. Reduce it to taste, and then thicken it if necessary with the diluted cornflour. Season and set aside.</p>
<p class="normala">Season and fry the pigeons in half the remaining oil, colouring them well all over for 8–10 minutes. Remove the trussing string and finish the pigeons in the preheated oven for about 6 minutes. Leave them to rest, breasts facing downward, on a warm plate, loosely covered with foil for 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="normala">Pour the sauce into the roasting pan, scrape off all of the juices well, bring to the boil, then transfer to a small pan and reserve.</p>
<p class="normala">Heat a cast-iron griddle or frying pan with the last of the vegetable oil until smoking and cook the potatoes and ceps until golden. Toss in the butter and dried savory and season.</p>
<p class="normala">Depending on your preference, you can either serve the pigeons whole, making sure you have finger bowls and large napkins, or carve them. If carving, make sure the potatoes and ceps are kept hot (an oven with the door ajar is the best place). Remove all of the legs first and keep them warm on the plate where the pigeons were resting. Run a very sharp knife down each side of the breastbone of each pigeon then cut through the joint at the top. Keep the breasts warm on the hot plate as you go. Add any escaped juices to the sauce, bring it to the boil and serve over the pigeon, ceps and potatoes.</p>
<p class="normal2"><span class="smallcaps">ON ROASTING SMALL BIRDS</span></p>
<p class="normala">To get a crisp golden skin on a pigeon or any other bird of a similar size, such as partridge, is a painstaking but worthwhile process. You need to turn the birds on to their breasts, thighs and finally tops in the pan, making sure that each surface is well caramelised. The great thing is that you can do all of this in advance, then have them ready – on their backs on a rack over a roasting tray – at room temperature and just add a few minutes to the final cooking time. The pigeons can be bought and the sauce made at least four days in advance.</p>
