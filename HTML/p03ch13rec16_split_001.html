<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">I adore everything made with quinces. This soft, creamy, fragrant paste is another thing entirely from the industrial</span> dulce de membrillo, <span class="italic">the firm, dark wine-red, usually overly sweet block that is traditionally served with cheese. It makes a marvelous dessert accompanied by a mild fresh cheese such as ricotta. It keeps for weeks in the refrigerator.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 8 OR MORE</span></p>
<p class="qun">4 quinces (about 2¾ pounds)</p>
<p class="qun1">¾ cup sugar</p>
<p class="recsum">Wash the quinces and scrub them if they still have the down on their skins. Put them in a baking dish and bake in a preheated 300°F oven for about 2 hours, until soft. Let cool slightly.</p>
<p class="recsum1">When the quinces are cool enough to handle, peel them, cut them in half, and cut out the cores with a sharp pointed knife. Cut into pieces, put in a food processor with the sugar, and blend to a soft, creamy paste.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Pour the quince paste into a wide nonstick saucepan and cook gently for about 30 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the paste thickens and turns pink. Keep scraping up and stirring in the paste that caramelizes at the bottom of the pan—it will give the paste a stronger color and enhance the flavor.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Pour the paste into a shallow dish, let cool, and chill in the refrigerator.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Serve it with a spoon accompanied by a soft fresh mild cheese such as ricotta.</p>
