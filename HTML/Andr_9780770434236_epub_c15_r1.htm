<div class="chapter_opener_text" id="div22">On a high plateau surrounded by three mountains stands a town that holds the stuff of legend for Spanish gourmets. Guijuelo is not the prettiest town in the Salamanca region of central Spain; it’s filled with industrial-looking warehouses. But its streets are also filled with signs beckoning visitors to places where they can eat its most famous product: <span class="italic">jamón ibérico de bellota</span>, the world’s best ham. <span class="italic">Jamón ibérico</span> has three defining traits: it’s made from wild Iberian pigs; those pigs are fed on a diet of acorns <span class="italic">(bellotas);</span> and the ham tastes extraordinarily good. As full-bodied as a fine Rioja and as rich as foie gras, Guijuelo’s <span class="italic">jamón</span> is the caviar of hams.</div>
<div class="chapter_opener_text1" id="div23">Yet there’s one sign you won’t see among the <span class="italic">jamón</span> houses advertising themselves on the streets of Guijuelo. Opposite a residential building in a quiet corner of town, where people hang their washing in the street, there’s a concrete building with shutters on the side. There’s no sign on the front, nothing to tell you this is the home of Joselito, the best <span class="italic">jamón ibérico</span>. Inside, behind a couple of offices, a simple wooden door opens onto a dark, cavernous room filled with an overwhelming aroma of curing hams. Hanging on the walls and from the ceiling, several rows deep, are thousands of legs of ham with brown cards attached. Each card carries the name of the customer who bought the ham two years before it arrives at their table. Joselito needs no advertising: you’re lucky if you can lay your hands on one of his hams.</div>
<div class="chapter_opener_text1" id="div24">In his kitchen two blocks away, José Gómez Martín, the owner of Joselito, explains what makes a great <span class="italic">jamón ibérico</span>. Each pig roams wild on two and a half acres of land, eating the acorns that give the hams such a distinctively rich and buttery flavor. From the Extremadura region in the southwest, where they are raised, the pigs travel north to Guijuelo to be butchered, salted, cured, and matured. But it’s also the mountains around the town that are special. In the winter months, José opens the north-facing shutters of his warehouse to the cold mountain air to help the salting and drying process on the upper floor. In the summer, he opens the shutters on the southern side of the building to allow the hot summer air to cure the <a id="page229"/>hams. Finally, the precious hams sit downstairs in the dark until they are ready for the finest restaurants across Europe, two years later.</div>
<div class="chapter_opener_text1" id="div25">If it’s hard to buy Joselito <span class="italic">jamón</span> in Spain, it’s even harder in the United States. Until recently, government restrictions have been a huge barrier to Spain’s cured meats; the traditional slaughtering techniques make such <span class="italic">jamón</span> impossible to import into the United States. That means Americans have been denied the very best <span class="italic">jamón</span>, although you can now buy some <span class="italic">jamón serrano</span>, its less illustrious relative. In the meantime, you can easily buy other pork products, including the classic chorizo sausage. And of course you can buy American pork and cook it in a Spanish way, as we do here. Hopefully, by the time you read this, Spain’s ham-makers will have convinced American officials to let their precious hams cross the Atlantic—so you too can eat <span class="italic">jamón ibérico</span>.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div27">In January 2004, <span class="italic">Food &amp; Wine</span> magazine invited me to contribute to an article about my home region of Asturias. The idea was to follow me around this wonderful part of Spain, showing readers its gastronomical treasures. One of the recipes that I chose to illustrate the article was <span class="italic">chorizo a la sidra</span>. Pork and apples are, in many ways, the two classic ingredients of Asturian cooking. They also happen to be the perfect match for each other.</div>

<div class="method1" id="div35">Pour the hard cider into the pan and raise the heat to high. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to medium. Cook for around 30 minutes, until the chorizos are soft and the cider is reduced to about ⅔ cup.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div36">Place a chorizo in each soup bowl and cover with the reduced cider. Serve with a hunk of crusty bread.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div54">I don’t know anyone in Spain who doesn’t love <span class="italic">croquetas</span>, and they are one of those dishes that always taste better at home. But today many tapas restaurants offer a huge variety of <span class="italic">croquetas</span>, filling them with different mixtures. At my Jaleo restaurants they are one of our most popular tapas, proving that good taste travels.

<div class="yield" id="div55"><span class="bold"><span class="dark_red">Makes about 36 fritters</span></span></div>
<div class="ingredients" id="div56">
<div class="IL_item_top" id="div57">8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div58">½ Spanish onion, peeled and finely chopped (about ½ cup)</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div59">2½ cups all-purpose flour</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div60">4 cups whole milk</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div61">½ cup finely chopped <span class="italic">jamón serrano</span> (Spanish cured ham)</div>

<div class="IL_item" id="div67">2 cups Spanish extra-virgin olive oil</div>
</div>
<div class="method" id="div68">Heat the butter in a medium sauté pan over a medium flame. Add the onions and cook until they are translucent, 5 minutes. Add 1½ cups of the flour and mix energetically. Cook for 5 minutes to make sure the flour is cooked through; it should start to take on a golden color. Pour the milk into the flour mixture and cook, stirring continuously, for about 2 minutes, until you have a thick béchamel.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div69">Add the ham and chicken, and sprinkle in the salt and nutmeg. Cook for another 2 minutes. You should now have a thick mixture that you can mold in your hands. Carefully pick up a bit and try to ball it with your hands. It shouldn’t be too sticky. If it does stick to your hands, cook it a little longer. Spread the mixture on a cookie sheet and let it cool to room temperature.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div70">Take a spoonful of the cooled béchamel mixture and roll it in your hands to make a small cylinder the size of a wine cork. Roll the cylinder in the remaining 1 cup of flour, then in the eggs, and then in the breadcrumbs. Repeat with all the <span class="italic">croquetas</span>.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div71">In a small, deep frying pan, heat the olive oil to 375 degrees (measured with a candy thermometer). Add the <span class="italic">croquetas</span> in small batches, making sure they are covered completely in oil. Fry until they have a nice golden color, about 1 minute; then transfer them to paper towels to drain. Repeat with all the <span class="italic">croquetas</span>, and serve hot.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div75">In 1993 a tall white-haired man with blue eyes started to come regularly to my tapas restaurant in downtown D.C. Every Sunday he was there at the door when we opened. The first thing he would order was a glass of white Muga Rioja and a plate of sausage and beans. Like a real Spaniard, he would go directly to the bar and eat standing up while he waited for his wife, Liz, or friends to join him. I must have spent hours talking with him about world affairs, including his meeting with the Spanish dictator Franco. I had no idea who he was, this distinguished man with the incredible stories. Two weeks after I first met him, I noticed that people were asking my new friend for his autograph. It was only then that I plucked up the courage to ask one of his friends for his name. Now when I think of this dish, I always remember Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. He might have celebrated his Irish roots, but to me his heart was really Spanish.</div>

Once the water begins to boil, add the bay leaf, onion, carrot, and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Reduce the heat to low and let the beans simmer slowly for 1 hour, periodically skimming off the foam that forms on the surface. Every 5 minutes or so, add a little cold water to slow down the boiling process. As the beans begin to soften, add salt to taste. When the beans are soft, scoop them out with a slotted spoon and set them aside.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div89">Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a sauté pan over a medium flame. Add the sausages and cook until done, 8 to 10 minutes. Set them aside.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div90">Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the same sauté pan. Add the garlic and sauté over a medium-high flame until it turns a light brown color, about 30 seconds. Add the beans and cook for 2 minutes. Add salt to taste.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div96">More often than not, meats roasted in the oven are very gray on the outside while they’re still pink inside. That’s because we tend to cook meat at too high a temperature. The result: the first couple of inches on the outside are overcooked and dehydrated. What we should do is lower the heat. Cooking it at a lower temperature for a longer period of time allows for the gelatinization of all the meat, without letting it lose its juices.

<div class="method" id="div109">Heat the oven to 250 degrees.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div110">Cut off and discard the ends of the tenderloin. Cut the tenderloin in half.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div111">In a large ovenproof sauté pan, heat the butter and olive oil over a medium flame. Add the apple pieces and cook until they start to become soft and browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the apples from the pan and set them aside.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div112">Add the onions to the pan and cook until they start to brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Return the apples to the pan and cover them with the oregano sprigs.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div113">Season the tenderloin with salt and pepper, and place the meat on top of the apples. Tilt the pan slightly and spoon a little of the oil-butter mixture over the pork. Put the sauté pan in the oven.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div114">Cook the pork until the temperature at the heart of the tenderloin reaches 140 degrees, 25 to 30 minutes. (Turn the tenderloin after 10 minutes.) Remove it from the oven. Remove the pork from the sauté pan and wrap it in aluminum foil to keep warm.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div115">Place the sauté pan over medium heat, add the brandy, and cook until reduced by half, about 1 minute. Then add the chicken stock and cook until it thickens slightly, forming a sauce, about 2 minutes.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div116">Slice each piece of pork tenderloin in half. Spoon a little sauce onto each plate, and place a piece of pork on top. Add 2 pieces of apple on top, and serve hot.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div120">In Spain we are crazy for ham, and we have a few dishes that pair the natural saltiness of ham with the sweetness of fruit, such as melon or dates. For me, these figs are the perfect match (although quite frankly a very good Spanish ham doesn’t really need any accompaniment). In summer, a very cold melon or figs topped with Spanish ham is one of the most refreshing dishes you will ever eat. I still remember my first Feria de Algeciras, the annual festival in the town my wife comes from. We were invited to a <span class="italic">caseta</span>, or private club, where they had a terrific <span class="italic">jamón ibérico</span> topped with very cold slices of melon. In the version below, I pair the ham with figs because they are my favorite fruit. They also bring back childhood memories of picking them from the wild trees in Santa Coloma de Cervellò, near Barcelona.</div>
<div class="yield" id="div121"><span class="bold"><span class="dark_red">Serves 4</span></span></div>
<div class="ingredients" id="div122">
<div class="IL_item_top" id="div123">8 fresh black Mission figs</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div124">3 tablespoons Spanish extra-virgin olive oil</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div125">4 slices <span class="italic">jamón serrano</span> (Spanish cured ham), cut into 2-inch squares</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div126">2 teaspoons sherry vinegar</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div127">1 tablespoon herb flowers (chives or thyme, for instance), optional, for garnish</div>
</div>
<div class="method" id="div128">Using a paring knife, carefully peel the figs (this is far easier to do when the figs are firm).</div>
<div class="method1" id="div129">Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a nonstick pan over a high flame. Sear the figs for 20 seconds all over, then put them on a serving dish. Lay a square of <span class="italic">jamón serrano</span> on top of each fig.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div130">Whisk the remaining 2 tablespoons oil with the vinegar in a small bowl, and drizzle around the plate. Garnish with the herb flowers (if using), and serve.</div>

<div class="tip_header" id="div131"><span class="bold">José’s tips</span></div>
<div class="tip_text" id="div132"><span class="italic">Jamón serrano</span> partners well with many fruits, including melon, pineapple, and the figs used here. Why? Because the saltiness of the ham and the sweetness of the fruit make an irresistible combination. If you don’t have the time to peel and sear the figs, try quartering them and serving them raw with the ham and dressing.</div>
