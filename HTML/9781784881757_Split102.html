<p class="tx2"><b>Mugello is a small town in the north of Tuscany and their recipe for these soft pillows of pasta filled with potato and cheese has become famous. Any leftover stuffing can be made into small patties and fried in oil. These are ideal to serve with a ragù such as the <a href="9781784881757_Split103.html#page_177">Duck Ragù</a> or <a href="9781784881757_Split100.html#page_171">Memmo’s Beef Ragù</a>.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">MAKES 200 G (7 OZ) FILLING FOR 36–40 (4 CM/1½ IN SQUARE) RAVIOLI</span></h4>
<p class="tx3"><b>FOR THE FILLING</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>200 g (7 oz) fluffy potatoes such as King Edward or Desiree, unpeeled</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 small garlic clove, peeled</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>5 g (¼ oz) parsley</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>generous pinch of finely grated nutmeg</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>½ teaspoon salt</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>35 g (1¼ oz) grated Parmesan</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="tx3"><b>FOR THE RAVIOLI</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 quantity of <a href="9781784881757_Split97.html#page_167">Fresh Pasta</a></b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>coarse semolina or ‘00’ flour, for dusting</b></p>
<p class="tx3">To make the filling, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil, add the potatoes and cook them in their skins until tender. It will take up to 1 hour for large ones, but don’t be tempted to cut them up or they become watery. Traditionally, they are always boiled, but they are also good pierced with a fork a few times and baked or cooked in a microwave. Meanwhile, finely cut the garlic and parsley together on a board. When the potatoes are cooked through, drain and peel them while they are still hot by holding a potato in one hand with a cloth or a fork and peeling or scraping away its skin with a knife. Ideally, pass the potatoes through a ricer, sieve or food mill into a bowl (if you don’t have any of those, use a masher). Mix in the garlic, parsley, nutmeg, Parmesan, salt and a good twist of pepper. Taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary. The filling should have a fairly strong flavour as it needs to be detectable through the pasta and sauce.</p>
