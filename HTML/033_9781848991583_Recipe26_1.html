<h5 class="h5"><a id="pageid_36"/><b>Tomato Confit, Chili</b> <span class="smfont">and</span> <b>Lemon Thyme Tartlets</b></h5>
<p class="normal"><b>These classic tarts represent, for me, all I love about the Mediterranean, such as the climate, the colors, the heat, the scents and the goodness of the fresh local and seasonal ingredients. My new additions of tomato confit, chili and lemon thyme give a freshness and great depth of flavor. You can also top the tartlets with a few peppery arugula leaves.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt">8 large, vine-ripened plum tomatoes, cut into ½-inch round slices, with the ends discarded</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">leaves from 6 lemon thyme sprigs</p>
<p class="acktxt">13 ounces rolled puff pastry dough, thawed if frozen</p>
<p class="acktxt">6 vine-ripened tomatoes</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 garlic clove, unpeeled but lightly crushed</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 white onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 long red chilies, seeded and finely chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="acktxt">Belgian Endive and Radish Salad (see <a href="015_9781848991583_Recipe9.html">page 19</a>), to serve</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Heat the oven to 300°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Put the sliced tomatoes on the prepared baking sheet, drizzle with half the olive oil, scatter one-third of the lemon thyme over and season with salt. Bake 2 hours, turning the tomatoes once, until they are dry and wrinkly. If they don’t look quite ready, return them to the oven 30 minutes longer, then check once more. Leave them to one side on the baking sheet.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Turn the oven up to 350°F. Cut the dough into 4 circles, each about 4 inches in diameter, then prick each circle all over with a fork. Put the dough circles on a cookie sheet, cover with a sheet or parchment paper and put a second cookie sheet on top. Put the dough circles, sandwiched between the cookie sheets, in the oven 10 to 12 minutes until they are golden brown and baked through. Carefully lift off the top cookie sheet and leave the pastry circles to cool.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Meanwhile, with a sharp knife, cut a small cross on the bottom of each of the remaining tomatoes, then put them in a heatproof bowl and cover with boiling water. Leave 30 seconds, then lift them out with a slotted spoon and put into a bowl of ice water. Lift the tomatoes out, then peel off and discard the skins. Cut the tomatoes into quarters and remove and discard the seeds, then roughly chop the flesh.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Heat a sauté pan over medium heat. Add the remaining olive oil and the chopped tomatoes and cook a few minutes to release the tomato juices. Add the garlic, onion and chilies, turn the heat down to medium-low and cook 20 to 30 minutes until thick and very soft. Stir once in a while to make sure the tomato mixture doesn’t catch or stick to the bottom of the pan. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then add another one-third of the lemon thyme and the extra virgin olive oil.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> To assemble the tartlets, divide the chopped tomato mixture between the pastry circles and spread it over the tops with the back of a spoon. Lay the slices of tomato confit on top, overlapping them slightly. Drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil and scatter the remaining lemon thyme over. Return the tartlets to the oven 5 to 8 minutes longer to warm through. Serve the tartlets warm with a Belgian endive and radish salad.</p>
