<p class="author1"><span class="txit">broccoli di rape alla tucci</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">My father’s family prepared broccoli rabe differently than my mother, so when they got married my mother learned to prepare it this way. The basic difference is that the Tuccis sauté their broccoli rabe and the Tropianos boil theirs. Serve as a side dish with meat, chicken, or fish. It may also be served between slices of Italian bread as a sandwich or as a topping on pizza or focaccia.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 pounds broccoli rabe (about 2 bunches)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 cloves garlic, chopped</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup water</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 lemon, quartered (optional)</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Snap off the flowered stems and leaves of the broccoli rabe, discarding the tough stems. Coarsely chop the remaining stems, leaving the buds whole, and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Warm the olive oil in a large sauté pan set over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until lightly colored, about 2 minutes. Add the broccoli rabe. Season with salt, add the water, and cover. Reduce the heat to a simmer and stir occasionally until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. (More water may be added, <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup at a time, if the broccoli rabe begins to stick to the pan.) Serve with the lemon quarters if desired.</p>
