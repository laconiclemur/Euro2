<h2 class="rec_heading" id="sab0000756"><a id="pg205" class="pcalibre calibre8"></a>SEA TROUT, AUTUMN ROOT PURÉE <span class="font">&amp;</span> <em class="calibre12">MORCILLA</em></h2>
<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0000758">Pan-fried sea trout with <em class="calibre9">jamón</em> (<em class="calibre9">trucha</em>) is a very typical dish of Navarra in northern Spain. This recipe is different, but it still combines surf and turf: it might sound cheffy but it’s really just a case of using three ingredients: sea trout, which should have very crispy skin and be juicy and pink in the middle, sweet chervil or another wintery root, and spiced rice <em class="calibre9">morcilla</em>.</p>
<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0000759">You will need to go to a really good market to find chervil root, which is in season from autumn to winter. If you can’t get hold of it (and it is rare), you could make the purée with celeriac or parsnips, even potatoes – but if you do see chervil root when you’re shopping, you should try it.</p>
<aside class="sidebar_wrapper">
<h5 class="serves" id="sab0000757">FOR 4</h5>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000760">500g chervil root, celeriac or parsnips</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000761">600ml double cream</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000762">125ml extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000763">25g unsalted butter</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000764">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000766">150g rice <em class="calibre9">morcilla</em> (Spanish black pudding)</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000767">1 x 1kg or 2 x 500g sea trout (ask your fishmonger to fillet and pin-bone the fish for you)</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000768">½ a bunch of fresh chervil, leaves picked, roughly chopped</p>
</aside>
<div class="maincontent_wrapper">
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000769">Fill a pan with water and heat until boiling. Add the chervil root (or other root vegetable) and cook until very soft – this won’t take long. When it starts to float, it’s done. Drain and peel while it is still hot (this way the skin comes off more easily). Put the peeled roots into a pan with the double cream, 50ml of olive oil, the butter, salt and pepper. Cook for a few minutes to bring together, then blend until very smooth. Put the lid on and keep warm.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000770">Cut the <em class="calibre9">morcilla</em> into 2cm thick medallions. Put a frying pan on a low heat and fry the <em class="calibre9">morcilla</em> until caramelized on the outside but still moist inside – it burns very quickly, so this will only take 30 seconds or so.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000771">Rinse out your frying pan, add the remaining 75ml of olive oil and put on a medium heat. When hot, place the sea trout in the pan, skin side down, and cook for 2 minutes, until crispy. If you want to check it’s cooked, don’t turn it over but lift it slightly at the side to have a peek. When you’re happy it’s ready, turn and cook the other side very quickly, just for 5 seconds or so, then remove from the pan.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000772">Spoon the root purée on to a plate. Place the black pudding on top, then the sea trout, skin side up. Sprinkle salt over the crispy fish skin and finish with the chopped chervil leaves.</p>
