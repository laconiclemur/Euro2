<p class="normal"><b>I have always enjoyed the delicate flavor of smoked sweet paprika, which is milder than smoked hot paprika, but should still be used carefully. Often found in Eastern European and Spanish dishes, sweet paprika brings an original twist to this French-style chicken pot-roasted in cider.</b></p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">SERVES</span></b> 4</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 10 minutes, plus making the stock</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 1 hour</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 chicken legs</p>
<p class="acktxt">1¾ cups dry hard cider</p>
<p class="acktxt">2¼ cups Chicken Stock (see <a href="007_9781848991583_Recipe1.html#pageid_16">page 16</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 teaspoon smoked sweet (mild) paprika</p>
<p class="acktxt">12 small turnips, peeled and quartered</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="acktxt">Thai-style Pilaf Rice, to serve (see <a href="019_9781848991583_Recipe13.html#pageid_21">page 21</a>)</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Heat a Dutch oven over high heat. Add the oil and the chicken legs, skin-side down, and seal them 5 to 6 minutes, turning them once, until they are brown all over. (You might need to do this in batches.) Spoon off any excess oil, then add the cider and deglaze the pot by stirring to remove any caramelized bits stuck to the bottom. Cook a few minutes until the cider reduces by half, stirring occasionally.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Add the stock and paprika and bring to a simmer over medium heat, then turn the heat down to low, partially cover with a lid and simmer about 15 minutes. Add the turnips, partially cover again and simmer 15 minutes longer, or until the chicken is cooked through and the turnips are tender.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Remove the chicken and turnips from the pot and put on separate plates. Season the chicken with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Return the pot to a medium heat and cook 6 to 8 minutes until the sauce reduces to a glaze and you have about 2 cups. Return the chicken and turnips to the pot and heat through, spooning the sauce over them. Serve with pilaf rice.</p>
