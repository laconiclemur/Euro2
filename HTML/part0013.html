Those ingredients must be processed without delay. Meats selected for its manufacture may be considered to be inferior by many people, the truth is that those meats are lean and rich in vitamins. The meats normally used are: head meat, heart, tongue, organ meat (liver, kidneys, lungs, brains, spleen), bladder, stomach, tripe. For different reasons many people object to blood consumption and a white head cheese (without blood and often filled with rice) has become quite popular. To make head cheese in a traditional way you need meats that are very rich in collagen (connective tissues). Those meats (hocks, skins) will produce gelatin which will bind everything together. Most Polish head cheeses have names related to the names of areas or cities that were once German or are located close to the German border. It will be very logical and almost correct to conclude that head cheese was the most popular among the German and Polish border towns. </span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">The original Polish name for a head cheese is “salceson” which has its origin in German name “pressen” - to press.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_78" src="../images/00066.jpeg"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2"> </span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 10.1</span></span><span class="calibre_16">

</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_16">courtesy Kruszynka.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre_2">In older technology books head cheese was often referred to as “brawn.” Jelled pork trimmings, chopped and pickled in vinegar were traditionally called “souse.” You may find in a supermarket a factory made head cheese bearing that name.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Head Cheese Color</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">Meat color is discussed in detail in the curing section. Not cured cooked meat develops a grey color, cured meat becomes pink. It is easy to cure small cuts of meat using the dry method of curing meat for sausages, however, traditional cheeses are made from pork head meat and less often from cow head meat. The head is a large part of an animal and is usually split into halves. It is possible to trim the meat off the head and cure it for 2-3 days with salt and sodium nitrite, however, some meat will remain attached to the bones. This meat transfers into a loss of money for a meat plant. It is more practical to cure the split head in curing solution for 4 days. After that the head will be cooked and the meat will be easily separated from bones with fingers. After cooking such meat will be pink. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">In many head cheeses meats are grey, so there was no curing at all. Some head cheeses are even called White Head Cheese, so the curing step does not take place. You may cure tongues only and leave other meats uncured. As a result, the solid chunks of red tongue will contrast with the grey meat and white skins and will become “show pieces” of the head cheese. In other words it is basically up to you how to influence the looks of the product. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">You can add Cure #1 to hot water, let’s say 1 tsp of Cure #1 per 2 cups of water when you cook meats and this will paint the meat pink. However, they will not be really cured and the pink layer will only be 1-2 mm (1/16”) deep. The inside of the meat will still be grey. This might not look well in a thick meat cut, however, the difference will be hardly noticeable if the thickness of the meat is less than 10 mm (1/2”). What is interesting is that you can place a fully cooked grey meat in boiling water with Cure # 1 and the meat will acquire a pink color, however, on the outside only. Commercially produced head cheeses were made from split pork and beef heads which were cured in a solution of salt, nitrate and water. After that, they were rinsed and cooked. Such meats developed a pink color. The majority of head cheeses are made from uncured meat, even if the split pork heads are used. The meats are just boiled without being cured with sodium nitrite (Cure #1). </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">If you want a solid chunk of meat to stand out and become “show meat”, cure it for 3 days with salt and sodium nitrite (Cure #1). Weigh the meat and apply 1.8% salt (18 g per 1 kg of meat). Estimate the amount of Cure #1 using the guideline of 2.5 g of Cure #1 per 1 kg (2.2 lb) of meat. </span></p><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_20" src="../images/00032.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 10.3 (left)</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> Meat selection. </span><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 10.4 (right)</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> Poached meats.</span></p><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_20" src="../images/00067.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 10.5 (left)</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> Cutting and grinding. </span><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 10.6 (right)</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> Mixing with groats.</span></p><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_20" src="../images/00021.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 10.7 (left)</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> Final mixing with broth. </span><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 10.8 (right)</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> Stuffing.</span></p><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_20" src="../images/00116.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 10.9 (left)</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> Poaching. </span><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 10.10 (right)</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> Cooling.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre_2">Many people object to eating head cheese because of its name. In other languages the name for headcheese does not mention “head” at all. The fact is that head cheese contains pork head meat, skin, snout, the parts that do not have much visual appeal. People do not realize that they consume those parts eating hot dogs and bologna where they are are hidden in the form of an emulsified paste. Yes, the American favorite sausage is made from offal meat, bone scrapped meat, plenty of water and chemicals. </span></span></p><p class="calibre_"><img class="calibre_24" src="../images/00008.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 10.11</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> Meats for head cheese.</span></p><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_17" src="../images/00001.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 10.12</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> Cooking meats.</span></p><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_17" src="../images/00085.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 10.13</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> Draining and cooling.</span></p><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_17" src="../images/00106.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 10.14</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> Separating meat from bones is easier when the meat is still warm.</span></p><p class="calibre_14"><img class="calibre_24" src="../images/00110.jpeg"/><span class="calibre_2"> </span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_16">Photo 10.15</span></span><span class="calibre_16"> Cooked head cheeses.
