</h1>
<p class="pf">I had so many questions about the meaning of life, and at a tender age I had come to believe that the Bible would hold all the answers. Since the only Bible we had in the house was in Finnish, it was my mission to get a Bible of my very own, one that I could read and study.</p>
<p>One day, when I was eleven years old, I was reading a magazine and came across an ad placed by a seed company: “You can earn rewards by selling seeds.”</p>
<p>One of the rewards for selling a certain amount of seeds was a Holy Bible. Wow! I knew I could do that. So I signed up for the deal. It wasn’t long before I received a package in the mail with packets of vegetable and flower seeds. I can’t remember how much they sold for, or how many I had to sell to gain enough points to “win” a Bible.</p>
<p>When the seeds arrived, I piled them into my bicycle basket and started down the road. Selling has never been easy for me—in fact, I like to joke that I couldn’t sell ice cream in hell! But sell them I did, all the same.</p>
<p>When I had sold just enough seeds to turn in the right number of points, I “won” a Bible. I just couldn’t wait for it to arrive. When it did, my name, Beatrice Luoma, was imprinted in gold on the right-hand corner of its black leather cover. My own Bible!</p>
<p>I fingered through the pages and filled in what I could of the family register that divided the Old and New Testaments. Here I would later record the deaths of my grandfather Joel Honkala and grandmother Sanna Luoma. I didn’t fill in any more pages until my marriage to Richard Ojakangas on Sunday, June 10, 1956, and the births of my children, Catherine Lee Ojakangas on October 1, 1957, and Gregory Wayne Ojakangas on August 14, 1959. After that, I retired my King James Version in favor of the newer translations.</p>
<p>One page of my new Bible was titled “Forty questions answered in the Word of God.” The intriguing questions covered a wide range of topics, but the one that really seemed important was “What is the greatest sin of all?” I was absolutely sure it had something to do with sex. But what was the answer? I was surprised when I read that the greatest sin was not to believe in God. This was, of course, written in the King James Version—even today a bit difficult to interpret. This sin is referred to in 1 John 5:10 (“He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself; he that believeth not in God hath made him a liar, because he believeth not the record that God gave of his son”), the Gospel according to John 5:38, and Numbers 23:19.</p>
<p>“Hmph,” I thought. “This doesn’t tell me anything I didn’t know!”</p>
