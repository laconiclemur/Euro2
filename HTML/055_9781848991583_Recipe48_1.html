<h5 class="h5"><a id="pageid_75"/><b>Pistachio Madeleines</b> <span class="smfont">with</span> <b>Chocolate Sorbet</b></h5>
<p class="normal"><b>This makes for a perfect combination, but you might also like to serve the madeleines with vanilla ice cream or even just a delcious, ripe pear. They also go well with the strawberries on <a href="057_9781848991583_Recipe50.html#pageid_79">page 79</a>, as an alternative for the lime shortbread. So many flavors seem to be made for madeleines—vanilla, cinnamon, star anise, hazelnut, orange, honey—but, for me, the one thing you certainly can’t beat is when they are served warm straight out of the oven.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 30 minutes, plus overnight resting and making the beurre noisette</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 15 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE CHOCOLATE SORBET</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup less 1 tablespoon superfine sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup unsweetened, dark cocoa powder</p>
<p class="acktxta">4 ounces dark chocolate, 60% cocoa solids, broken into small pieces</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE PISTACHIO MADELEINES</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">unsalted butter, for greasing</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ teaspoon baking powder</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 eggs</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup less 1 tablespoon superfine sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 tablespoons milk</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 teaspoons mild honey</p>
<p class="acktxt">⅔ cup warm Beurre Noisette (see <a href="023_9781848991583_Recipe17.html">page 22</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">¼ cup pistachio nuts, toasted and chopped</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> First, prepare the madeleines. Lightly grease a 12-hole madeleine tray. Sift the flour and baking powder into a mixing bowl and leave to one side. Beat together the eggs and sugar in a large mixing bowl, using an electric mixer, about 10 minutes until the mixture is pale, thick and doubles in volume.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Heat the milk and honey together in a small saucepan until the honey is just melted. Fold the flour mixture into the egg mixture, then pour in the milk and honey, stirring until combined. Add the warm <i>beurre noisette</i> and mix slowly until fully incorporated, then fold in the pistachios. Spoon the mixture into the prepared madeleine tray, half-filling each hole. Cover with plastic wrap and leave to rest in the refrigerator overnight.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> To make the sorbet, pour 1¼ cups water into a small saucepan. Mix together the sugar and cocoa powder, then add to the water and bring to a boil, whisking continuously. It’s very important not to let the cocoa powder sink to the bottom of the pan and burn.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Put the chocolate pieces in a heatproof bowl. When the cocoa mixture has reached a boil, pour the hot liquid onto the chocolate pieces and whisk until the chocolate melts. Pass the mixture through a fine strainer into a 1-pint freezerproof container and freeze until hard.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> When the sorbet is hard, cut the mixture into pieces and blitz in a food processor until smooth. Return to the freezer container and freeze at least 3 hours until firm.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>6</b> The next day, heat the oven to 400°F. Bake the madeleines 5 minutes, then turn the tray around in the oven, front to back, even if you have a fan oven, and bake 5 minutes longer, or until they are light golden and slightly firm to the touch. Insert a skewer into a madeleine and if it comes out clean, they are ready. If not, bake 2 minutes longer and check again. Remove the tray from the oven and leave to cool 5 minutes, or until lukewarm before turning out and serving with the chocolate sorbet.</p>
