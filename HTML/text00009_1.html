<h1 class="cs">A Story of Famine, Fire, and Fear</h1>
<p class="pf">My maternal grandfather, Joel Sakris Honkala, was the only one of five boys who didn’t starve to death in the famine of the late 1800s in northern Finland. Because his family wanted a better life for him, they pooled their money and bought him passage to America when he was in his late teens. I don’t know why, but he first went to Florida; perhaps others in his group were headed that way, too. The Grandpa Honkala I knew wore a rather floppy fedora, sometimes a bit askew, and by the time I was thirteen he had shrunk to my height. His arthritis caused him to limp and he was bowlegged. Through all of that, though, he was a smiling, affable character who loved his grandchildren.</p>
<p>Grandpa Honkala—who would give me the name of “Peetsi” or “Peachie”—was baffled by the modern names of his grandchildren. That’s a fruit, he mused when he heard my name, Beatrice, which sounded like <i>peesti</i>
 to him, or “peach.” Then came Lillian or “Liljan kukka,” <i>kukka</i>
 being Finnish for “flower,” and then Marion, or <i>marja</i>
—a berry. All these names are a translation, mixing Finnish and English. When a cousin of mine was born who was named “Carol Jean,” he exclaimed, “Karosine! Now I have heard it all!”</p>
<p>When Grandpa was younger and had just immigrated to Florida, he picked up a saxophone and I’ve heard did very well—so well that he earned enough money playing in a dance band that he could go back to Finland and marry my grandmother, Amanda Aurora Nevala Tassi, who was called “Ruusu,” Rose.</p>
<p>Ruusu was a seamstress and owned a small dress shop in Kurikka, a village in the western part of Finland. The first two years after their marriage were difficult. She lost a child. Then my aunt Elma was born. They decided to sell the dress shop and all that was in it and use the money to leave Finland and go to America.</p>
<p>Joel undoubtedly had favorable things to say about America, and they prepared to leave—this time to go to Minnesota, where they heard they could get free land to build a farming life. They homesteaded in Brookston, about twenty-five miles west of Duluth, around the year 1910. They had a boy, Alfred, and in 1913, my mother, Esther, was born. Two years later, my aunt Helen was born. Grandpa built a nice, wood frame house, large for the area, that had both an upstairs and a downstairs for his wife and four children.</p>

</div>
<p>The year 1918 had been hot and dry—the woods and fields were tinder-dry, and the crops hadn’t done well. It is claimed that a spark from a coal-burning train combined with extremely dry conditions started the horrific fire that began in Cloquet, Minnesota, in October of that year and spread northward. Over 450 lives were lost, dozens of communities were destroyed, and hundreds of thousands of acres of woods burned. For people lost in a single day, it remains the worst natural disaster in the history of Minnesota. My grandparents and their family, including my five-year-old mother, were caught in the middle of it.</p>
<p>As the fire moved swiftly toward their farm, my grandfather Joel and his son, Alfred, lowered buckets into their well and used the water to wet the house and its surroundings. They turned the cows, the horses, and the pigs loose out of their barns. Ruusu hauled household belongings, including baked loaves of bread and canned goods, into the root cellar not far from the house. Joel kept dousing the house with the buckets of water.</p>
<p>Ruusu was known for being excitable, and in a frenzy as she saw the flames coming toward them and soon to engulf them all, she put my mother, Elma, Alfred, and Helen into a horse cart and took off at a gallop. To her dying day, my mother wondered where her mother thought she could escape to ahead of the flames. But the flames encircled them.</p>
<p>The horse was soon overcome, and the cart became mired in a creek bed. Ruusu, with Elma and Alfred, ran back to the house. My mother and her three-year-old sister, Helen, crawled under the seat. “But where are the little girls?” Grandpa Joel yelled. Ruusu said they were already dead in the cart.</p>
<p>“They are not dead!” Joel cried. With that he ran through the flames to the cart, put the girls, both of them singed and burned, over his shoulders, and brought them back to the house.</p>
<p>My mother, Esther, had the most burns of the two girls. Her arms were badly burned, as were her legs and thighs. Her skin grew back silky and patterned. Growing up, accustomed to the swirls and curls of the scars on my mother’s arms, I thought that all mothers had “flowers on their arms.” I would sit on her lap and trace the petals and leaves with my little fingers, and I thought her arms were beautiful. I don’t think she wanted to scare me, but as I grew older she told me the story about the fire little by little.</p>
<p>After Grandpa had saved the girls, the winds changed and the farmhouse did not burn. All of the animals died except for one horse and its foal, which stood in the middle of a plowed field and were spared. Even when that horse grew old and lame, Grandpa couldn’t bring himself to destroy it. My mother and father inherited the horse after they were married and it lived with them for many years.</p>
<p>After the fire died down around their farm, the Red Cross arrived. The fire had moved on toward Duluth—which made the Grand Rapids hospital, about fifty miles to the northwest, more accessible than Duluth’s hospital, even though Duluth would have been about twenty-five miles closer. My mother and Helen were hospitalized, and Ruusu went along to assist the nursing staff. The hospital was teeming with burned and sick people.</p>
<p>In letters that my mother saved, Ruusu had written to Joel, telling of how lonesome she was and how badly Esther was burned, but how she didn’t complain. Ruusu asked my grandfather questions like, “Did the bread survive the fire?” and “Was everything destroyed?” It was late October, winter was coming, and Joel had his hands full preparing as much as he could for the cold months to come.</p>
<p>After a painful month in the hospital, and to make matters even worse after the horrific fire, there came word of a rising influenza epidemic. The flu pandemic of 1918 affected five hundred million people across the world and killed three to five percent of the world’s population.</p>
<p>One morning Grandpa Joel made his usual phone call to the hospital. He asked about the condition of his daughters. The answer was, “Your daughters are doing well, but your wife died last night.” Ruusu, in the hospital taking care of her children, had taken ill and died. In some of her letters to Joel, she was asking for more warm underwear as she felt so chilled. I wonder how long she actually was ill. My mother told me she remembered seeing her mother’s body, passing by, covered, on a gurney. “I don’t know how, but I knew it—that my mother was dead.”</p>
<p>Ruusu had, over the few years that she and Joel had lived in Brookston, seemingly befriended everyone. She was the first to be there when a baby was born, when somebody was sick, when anybody needed help. She was there with food, care, and concern. Ruusu was beloved by all. The news of her death shocked the township and the neighboring townships.</p>
<p>There was Joel, now desperately in need of help. Four children, two of them badly burned in the fire, the farm all but demolished, and winter coming on.</p>
<p>Brookston is on the northern edge of the Fond du Lac reservation. Finns and American Indians got along well. They had similar skills, similar problems, and similar resourceful mentalities. My mother as well as the whole family learned to speak Ojibwe. The Ojibwe in the area learned Finnish. They had a deep kinship. One of the Indian families offered to adopt my mother and her siblings after the horrible events. But, of course, Grandpa Joel would hear none of that.</p>
<p>Instead, he wrote for a Finnish “mail-order bride” who, he said, had to be able to cook and keep house. That was all he asked.</p>
<p>Helena Lindgren had taken chef’s training in Helsinki so that she could be employed in New York City until she was called to be a mail-order bride. She was among the seven percent of Finns whose first language was Swedish. Helena accepted Joel’s invitation and headed for Minnesota.</p>
<p>Helena owned a cookbook that was published in Helsinki in 1909 and was written in two languages, English on the one side and Finnish on the other. It was published especially for young women in cookery school. The dual-language book was highly convenient: someone who employed a Finnish-trained cook could read the English version of each recipe and, without communicating in Finnish herself, tell her employee what she wanted cooked.</p>
<p>This book is in my library now. I have enjoyed deciphering Helena’s notes in the book and especially her additional recipes scribbled in the margins. It took me years to realize that “Zugar Gukis” was her phonetic rendering of “sugar cookies” and that “Bunsk Kaik” meant “sponge cake.”</p>
<p class="psec">Life in Brookston, Minnesota, was a far cry from the relative luxury Helena had known in New York. It was November 1918, with winter coming, on a burned-out farm where she was called to replace the wife of somebody she did not know in the least. And Helena certainly came to realize that she was expected to fill the shoes of a woman who now was almost sainted in the community. Helena’s kitchen became her castle, and nobody was allowed in—especially my mother and her sisters. Although Helena was an excellent cook, she was not a teacher and vehemently disliked my mother, saying (in Finnish), “I don’t need a watchdog in my kitchen.” My mother decided right there that her kids would learn how to cook and would always be welcome in her kitchen. Her experience made a lasting impression on my mother, and ultimately, on me.</p>
<p>To finish high school, my mom moved to Duluth, where she worked for her room and board with a Jewish family by the name of Stern who would become lifelong family friends. She enrolled in Duluth’s Central High School, an imposing, beautiful building that was built in 1892 of locally quarried sandstone.</p>

</div>
<p>Most everyone who has visited Duluth, even today, knows Old Central with its 230-foot clock tower that rises above the downtown, a Romanesque brownstone building modeled after the Allegheny Courthouse in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The building’s brownstone came from the Krause Quarry in Fond du Lac and other quarries along the Wisconsin south shore of Lake Superior. Today, when I drive through Duluth and see that building, thoughts of my mother come to mind.</p>
<p>Mom said her shoes never fit properly, and she told me she would kick them off under her desk. For this she was bullied and kids would throw her shoes down the hallway to embarrass her. Finally, in her junior year she couldn’t take the harassment anymore and dropped out of school.</p>
<p>At the same time, my father, Ted, had left his home in Cedar Valley and was working at the Neil Bort Pie Company in Duluth. Neil Bort Pies were small handheld pies that had fillings of chocolate, lemon, apple, berries, and other fruits.</p>
<p>The two met at a dance at the “62 Hall” in Brookston. Mom had continued to work as a household assistant and cook for the Stern family in Duluth after dropping out of school. After dating for a short time, my mother and father were married on October 29, 1933, on his family’s farm in Cedar Valley.</p>
<p>When Ted took Esther home to meet the Luoma family, his mother, Sanna, asked the critical question, “Are you a Laestadiolainen?,” referring to a form of conservative Lutheran revivalism common at that time in Scandinavian countries, including Finland.</p>
<p>Although Sanna was steadfastly religious, she did not subscribe to the Laestadian philosophy. Rather, the family worshiped about once a month in a small Lutheran church in Cedar Valley. In the winter they held their “services” in homes because the little church building had only a woodstove in the middle of the floor for heat and to this day has only a two-hole outhouse, about twenty feet from the structure, and no place to park either cars or horses and wagons.</p>
<p>Mom replied that no, she wasn’t. And with that, she was approved to join the family.</p>

</p>
<p class="rpf">Here is the recipe for “Zugar Gukis” as it reads in Helena’s cookbook.</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpilf">1 glass sugar</p>
<p class="rpil">1 pound flour</p>
<p class="rpil">1 egg</p>
<p class="rpil">½ pound butter</p>
<p class="rpil">½ cup milk</p>
<p class="rpill">1 teaspoon soda</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">There are no directions for assembly. However, in my experimentation, the following recipe is close:</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpilf">1 cup sugar</p>
<p class="rpil">1 cup butter</p>
<p class="rpil">1 egg</p>
<p class="rpil">3 cups all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="rpil">1 teaspoon baking soda</p>
<p class="rpil">½ cup buttermilk</p>
<p class="rpil">1 teaspoon vanilla</p>
<p class="rpill">Extra sugar for shaping</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">Preheat the oven to 375°F. Cream the 1 cup sugar and butter until smooth. Add the egg and beat until light. Mix the flour and baking soda and add to the creamed mixture alternately with the buttermilk and vanilla, mixing until a stiff dough is formed.</p>
<p class="rp">Shape the dough into balls the size of walnuts and place 2 inches apart on a greased or parchment-covered cookie sheet. With the bottom of a water glass dipped first in water and then in sugar, stamp the cookies to flatten out to about 2½ to 3 inches. Bake about 10 minutes until light golden.</p>
<p class="rpy">Makes about 4 dozen cookies</p>
