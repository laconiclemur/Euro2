			<p class="rec-intro">A speciality of southwest France, foie gras is particularly good served with a local sweet wine such as Barsac or Sauternes. Be sure to keep the fat that is rendered as the liver cooks and use it in another dish. </p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 4 as a starter or 2–3 as a main course</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">30 seedless white grapes</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">60g golden raisins</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">60ml dry white wine</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">60ml marc de Bourgogne (or grappa)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 whole duck foie gras (450g)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 shallots, peeled and finely chopped </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 tbsp caster sugar</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 tbsp sherry vinegar</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">200ml duck stock</p>

			<p class="body">To peel the grapes, plunge them into a pan of boiling water for a few seconds, then remove and refresh in iced water. Using a sharp knife, gently remove the skins and put the grapes in a bowl. Blanch the raisins in boiling water for 30 seconds, then drain and add them to the bowl with the grapes. Pour in the white wine and marc or grappa and leave the grapes and raisins to marinate for at least a couple of hours.</p>
			<p class="body">Preheat the oven to 220°C/Fan 200°C/Gas 7. Break the duck foie gras into 2 natural pieces and remove any obvious nerves, blemishes or green stains from the gall bladder, which may be bitter. Season the liver well, place it in a cold ovenproof pan and put it into the hot oven. Cook for 10 minutes, then turn the liver over and baste it with the rendered fat. Continue to cook until the smaller of the lobes of foie gras is firm to touch and cooked through; this should be no more than 15 minutes in total. Remove and leave to rest in a warm place while the larger lobe cooks for a further 10 minutes. Place it with the smaller one, drain off the fat into a bowl and store in the fridge. </p>
			<p class="body">Using the same pan, sweat the shallots until translucent, then add the sugar and vinegar. Cook for a couple of minutes, then add the marinade from the grapes and raisins and boil until reduced to a glaze. Add the stock and reduce again until it has the consistency of a sauce. Pour this over the grapes and raisins and serve hot with the liver.</p>
