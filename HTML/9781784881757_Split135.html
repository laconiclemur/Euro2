<p class="tx2"><b>These steamed vegetables will match the subtle and delicate flavours of fish or roast chicken, or are more than worthy of a lunch on their own. The flavour of the vegetables is concentrated and any juices stay in the paper. They are typically served completely plain or with a little seasoning and a drizzle of good-quality olive oil. Their intense flavour means you hardly need any salt, so go easy with seasoning.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>I have been playing around with the flavours, since I am not good at leaving something simple alone! I like to add herbs and spices, leave some unseasoned, or add a knob of butter to the parcel – some of my favourites are courgettes (zucchini) wrapped with a splash of olive oil and a sprig of tarragon; carrots and leeks together in a parcel with nutmeg, black pepper, a small pinch of salt and a knob of butter; and potatoes and parsley or fennel with a few fennel seeds. Happy experimenting!</b></p>
<h4><span class="line">selection of fennel, potatoes, carrots, courgettes (zucchini), cauliflower and (bell) peppers, cut into bite-sized pieces</span></h4>
<p class="tx3">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F/Gas 4). Wrap the cut vegetables in baking parchment, following the instructions for cooking <i>al cartoccio</i> on <a href="9781784881757_Split30.html#page_49">how to make a cartoccio</a>. Bake in the oven for 7–30 minutes, depending on the vegetable, or until cooked. The more watery, soft vegetables take less time than firm carrots and potatoes, for example (and the finer you cut them the quicker they will cook). You can press the top of the parcel to feel the give in the vegetables. Here are some examples of timings and flavour suggestions.</p>
