<p class="author1"><span class="txit">cosciotto di agnello</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">When serving a meat dish as a main course I follow the Italian tradition of beginning the meal with a pasta dish, followed by the meat course accompanied by a simply cooked vegetable. We finish with a green salad followed by nuts and fresh fruit. I find that pacing the meal in this way leaves me feeling less full.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 boneless butterflied leg of lamb (about 4 pounds off the bone)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cloves garlic, crushed</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 fresh sage leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Two 5-inch sprigs fresh rosemary, cut in half</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Two 5-inch sprigs fresh oregano, torn into pieces, or <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> teaspoon dried</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup dry red wine</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 medium-size onion, cut into 1-inch-thick slices</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> lemon, quartered</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Place the lamb in a large glass baking dish or sealable plastic bag. In a medium-size bowl, mix the olive oil, garlic, sage, rosemary, oregano, wine, onion, and vinegar. Add the lemon sections, squeezing them gently to release some of the juice. Pour this over the lamb, cover, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, basting the meat occasionally. Allow the meat to return to room temperature before grilling.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Prepare a grill that has a cover. Cook the meat on the grill, covered, basting once or twice with the marinade, until well browned on one side, about 12 minutes. Turn the meat over and baste once. Cover the grill and cook the meat for 12 minutes more for medium to medium-rare, and 15 minutes for medium-well to well-done meat. (Rare lamb registers 160° F on a meat thermometer; well done is 175° F. If the fire flares <a id="page_275"/>around the meat, remove the cover and spray the fire with water to prevent charring.) Remove from the grill, cover with a sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest for 5 to 10 minutes before carving.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">NOTE</span>:</span> Marinade that has been in contact with raw meat may be used if the heat of the fire will have time to cook it along with the meat. That is why we do not advise basting again during the last half of grilling time.</p>
