  <h2 class="section sgc-1" id="heading_id_2"><a id="page226"></a>THE STUFFED CREPES</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Glamorized <em>cannelloni</em>, stuffed crêpes may contain practically anything and they represent one of the prettiest and most satisfactory means of disposing of leftovers (odds and ends of meats, vegetables, mushrooms, etc., bound with a bit of stiff sauce—tomato, <em>demi-glace</em>, <em>béchamel</em>, <em>velouté</em>, <em>duxelles</em>). Various soufflé mixtures (either dessert or entrée) are commonly used also.</p>

  <p class="indent">The sorrel in this recipe may be replaced by spinach (often allied with brains, particularly in Italian cooking), first parboiled, well drained, finely chopped, and stewed in butter long enough to evaporate excess moisture.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c13-s50"><em><span class="color">Gratin of Stuffed Crêpes</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Gratin de Crêpes Fourrées</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>6 large (7-inch) or 12 small (5-inch) <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#crpes">Crêpes</a> (but replace the milk by room-temperature beer, eliminate the sugar and add a tablespoon of finely chopped fines herbes)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 calf’s brain</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about ¼ pound butter, in all</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about</em> 10 <em>ounces sorrel</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 egg</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, pepper, nutmeg</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>freshly grated Parmesan cheese</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 medium-size can (2 cups) whole tomatoes, stewed in butter (in season, fresh tomatoes, peeled and seeded before stewing)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>parsley</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Make Crêpes as per directions.</p>

  <p class="indent">Soak the brain in cold water for an hour or so, carefully remove the membrane, and soak it again in fresh cold water to “bleach” it. Stew it gently in a small frying pan or saucepan, with 2 tablespoons butter, for about 20 minutes, shaking the pan from time to time to prevent its sticking, and turning it after 10 minutes. Purée it through a fine sieve.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page227"></a>Wash the sorrel in several waters, tear off the stems, pulling them backward to remove any fibrous material in the leaves, gather them into a tight mass on the chopping board, and shred them finely. Stew them, salted, in 4 tablespoons butter, stirring now and then, until they have melted into a purée (15 or 20 minutes).</p>

  <p class="indent">Combine the brain, sorrel, and egg, whisking or beating with a wooden spoon, taste for salt, add freshly ground pepper to taste, and a tiny bit of freshly grated nutmeg (the whole brain, sorrel, and egg may be combined in a blender). Stuff the crêpes, folding the sides up and over the stuffing and leaving the ends open. The form will be that of a small omelet. Place them side by side in a buttered shallow baking or “gratin” dish, folded side down, sprinkle with grated cheese, regularly distribute the remainder of the butter in fine slivers over the entire surface, and bake in a medium-hot oven (375° F.) for about 15 minutes, or until the cheese has formed a light gratin and the stuffing has become resilient to the touch. Place halved tomatoes over crêpes and sprinkle with parsley before serving.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_3">THE STUFFED CALVES’ EARS</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Lucien Tendret’s little book, <em>La Table au Pays de Brillat-Savarin</em> (the most recent edition, long since out of print, dates from 1934), although mainly anecdotal, contains a handful of more or less perfunctorily presented recipes, each of which, once <em>mise au point</em>, is a small masterpiece, All are stamped by those special refinements typical of the passionate amateur which, when understood and respected by a professional, produce that rarity, a chef of genius. Alexandre Dumaine, now retired, drew a number of his specialties from this work. The <em>poularde au vapeur</em>, necessarily modified—the original recipe requires that the bird be stuffed with whole truffles—figured, <em>sur commande</em>, on Dumaine’s daily menu. Certain others, the elaboration of which, on a restaurant menu, could only spell bankruptcy, he delighted in preparing for special occasions.</p>

  <p class="indent">The recipe below, altered in some few details after a number of experiments, remains nonetheless loyal in spirit to Tendret. The result is divine.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page228"></a>Preliminary cooking preparations should be got out of the way the preceding day so that the chilled, stuffed ears may receive their breading a number of hours before the meal. The fragile surface, through drying slightly, is more easily handled and less liable to be damaged during the frying. Last-minute work consists only in the actual frying, and finishing the sauce.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c13-s51"><em><span class="color">Stuffed Calves’ Ears, Béarnaise Sauce</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Oreilles de Veau Farcies, Sauce Béarnaise</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>6 calves’ ears, cut off well into the head</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 lemon</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 cups dry white wine</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 cups rich, gelatinous <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#rh1">Veal Stock</a> (if prepared especially, add the trimmings of the ears and chicken breasts, plus a handful of chicken necks)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 veal sweetbread</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 heaping tablespoons <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#page74">Mirepoix</a> (if prepared especially, count 1 medium onion and 1 medium carrot)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>breast and liver of a large roasting chicken</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 tablespoons (2 ounces) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 large fresh black truffles (approximately 6 ounces in all)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 heaping tablespoon flour</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 egg yolks</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon cream</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 loaf of firm-textured, half-dried-out (but not hard) white bread</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>5 egg whites (the 3 extra yolks may be submerged in water to protect them from the air and used later for the béarnaise)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ pound (8 ounces) clarified butter (gently melted over a low heat, allowed to settle, the clear butter poured off for use, leaving the whitish residue behind)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup olive oil</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE EARS</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Neatly trim the base of the ears, taking care neither to cut too closely to the joining section at the base nor to cut into the “well” at the ears’ point of entry into the head. Cover them generously, in a large <a id="page229"></a>saucepan, with cold water, bring to a boil, and leave to simmer for 10 minutes. Plunge them into cold water, drain them, and carefully clean them, rubbing gently with a cloth, scraping here and there to remove any remaining hairs, and cleaning out the canal-like areas in the “well” of the ear with a small stiff brush. Rinse well, sponge them dry, and rub them inside and out with the cut halves of a lemon.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cut pieces of cloth (an old bedsheet will do) into approximately 8-inch squares, wrap an ear in each, neatly and firmly, taking care to gently force it into its natural position (it will have been warped out of shape during the initial parboiling), and sew the package tightly. Choose a large saucepan or deep <em>sauteuse</em> of just the right size to hold the ears placed side by side and touching, but without being packed in. Pour over them the white wine and enough stock to completely cover them, bring to a boil and cook, covered, at a bare simmer for 3½ hours, adding a bit of boiling stock when necessary, to keep the ears submerged. Leave them until almost cool in their cooking liquid, remove them from their cloth envelopes and put them aside.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE SWEETBREAD</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Prepare and braise the sweetbread exactly as described in the Veal Sweetbreads in Macaroni Timbale recipe on <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12.5">this page</a>, using the ears’ cooking liquid, somewhat reduced, as braising liquid. Remove the sweetbread, pass the <em>mirepoix</em> and braising liquid through a fine sieve, supplement it with enough of the ears’ cooking liquid to make a good cupful, and put it aside.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE CHICKEN BREAST AND LIVER</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Remove the skin and bones from the breast, season it, and cook it in the butter without browning, only until just firm—2 or 3 minutes on each side. A minute before removing from the heat, add the liver.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE STUFFING</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Peel the truffles, chop the peelings very finely, remove breast and liver from pan, leaving the butter, and cut the truffles, chicken breast, liver and sweetbread into approximately ⅓-inch cubes. Reheat the butter in the chicken’s cooking pan, add the cubed meats and truffles and the chopped peelings, sprinkle with flour, and, after stirring everything <a id="page230"></a>around to permit the flour to cook slightly, stir in the cupful of braising liquid. As soon as the mixture is thoroughly thickened, remove it from the fire and stir in the two egg yolks, first mixed with a spoonful of cream.</p>

  <p class="indent">When cooled, pack the stuffing into the ears, gently so as not to damage them, but firmly enough to leave no possible air pockets, particularly in the ducts at the base, smooth the surface, mounding it slightly, to the edges and point of each ear, and put them to chill for several hours—or overnight—so that ears and stuffing will be firm enough to be easily workable.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE BREADING</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">In order to grate fresh bread crumbs (which, for all breaded, fried objects, gives a finer result than dried crumbs) the bread must be firmly textured and, without being dried out, sufficiently stale to crumble. Remove the crusts, grate the bread, and, if the result is not uniformly fine, pass the crumbs through a coarse sieve. You will need a generous pile.</p>

  <p class="indent">Sprinkle the naked surface of the ears—but not the surface of the stuffing—with flour. Beat 3 of the egg whites with a pinch of salt until stiff, carefully pass each ear in the beaten whites, making certain that it is evenly coated, and roll it ever so delicately in the crumbs, first placing it on the bed of crumbs and sprinkling the top surface with crumbs. Finally, sprinkle again any parts to which no crumbs have adhered, lightly patting the surface, but never with pressure. Leave them to dry for 2 or 3 hours in the open air (not in the refrigerator), then beat the remaining egg whites, repeat the breading procedure, and leave the ears on a light bed of crumbs to dry for 7 or 8 hours.</p>

  <p class="indent">Use either 1 pan large enough to hold the breaded ears comfortably without touching or 2 medium-sized pans (in which case the quantity of butter and oil may have to be augmented—the fat should be deep enough for the ears to bathe over halfway, permitting them to become evenly colored on all sides with a single turning). Heat the clarified butter and the oil together until fairly hot but not smoking, and gently put the ears, stuffed surface down, in the fat. Survey them carefully, turning the fire up and down between medium and low, if necessary, to achieve an even, crisp, golden surface without burning. <a id="page231"></a>Turn them over carefully with the prong tips of a fork, taking care not to pierce the crust. Drain them on paper towels, enclose them in a folded napkin on a warmed platter, and serve immediately, accompanied separately by the béarnaise sauce.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_4">THE BEARNAISE SAUCE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Fresh tarragon gives the distinctive quality to a béarnaise. When it is not available, the usual replacement is tarragon leaves “pickled” in vinegar. A superior preserve consists in packing alternate layers of fresh tarragon leaves and salt into jars which, after sealing, are then sterilized. The sauce, mainly an emulsion of butter in slightly cooked egg yolks, is served tepid. Any attempt to heat it beyond this point will result in its separating. It may be prepared somewhat ahead of time and kept in a <em>bain-marie</em> of warm, but not hot, water. It is most often served with grilled meats, but can be useful with poached or grilled fish or grilled poultry.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="heading_id_5"><em><span class="color">Béarnaise Sauce</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Sauce Béarnaise</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup dry white wine</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ cup wine vinegar (preferably tarragon-flavored white-wine vinegar)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 finely chopped gray shallots (or 1 medium-small onion)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, freshly ground pepper, a tiny pinch of Cayenne</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>a small handful (</em>about ½ ounce) tarragon and chervil branches and leaves</p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 egg yolks</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ pound fresh sweet butter, cut into small pieces and allowed to soften at kitchen temperature</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 teaspoon each of finely chopped tarragon and chervil leaves</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Combine white wine, vinegar, shallots, salt, pepper, Cayenne, and the handful of branches and leaves, coarsely chopped and crushed, in a small, heavy saucepan or, better, in a small earthenware casserole <a id="page232"></a>protected from the direct heat by an asbestos pad. Boil until only 3 or 4 tablespoons of liquid remain, pass through a fine sieve, pressing the debris, and return the liquid to the saucepan. Add the egg yolks and, over a tiny flame, using a small whisk, stir in a rapid, circular motion. After a few seconds, add about one-third of the butter, continuing to whisk, and, as the butter is absorbed, add another third, and finally the last third, continuing to whisk until the butter is totally absorbed and the sauce begins to thicken. Remove the saucepan from the heat but continue to stir the sauce, which, because of the heat retained in the saucepan, will continue thickening. Taste for seasoning and stir in the chopped herbs.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_6">THE MOLDED TAPIOCA PUDDING</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Similar puddings may be made with rice, semolina, vermicelli, noodles, etc. Rather than serve an accompanying sauce, the mold may be lined with caramelized sugar. Served hot or warm, Sabayon Sauce (see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c03_r1.htm#page137">Charlotte with Crêpes</a>) is also a fine accompaniment, and served cold, a fresh raspberry purée is another possibility.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c13-s52"><em><span class="color">Molded Tapioca Pudding, Apricot Sauce</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Pudding Moulé au Tapioca, Sauce aux Abricots</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 cups milk</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ cup sugar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 small pinch salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ vanilla bean (or ½ teaspoon extract)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>6 tablespoons (3 ounces) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 ounces tapioca (approximately ½ cup)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 eggs, separated</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Apricot sauce:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>puréed stewed apricots, flavored with a small glass of Madeira or port wine, and sweetened to taste. If the pudding is served hot or warm, the sauce should be heated and</em> 2 <em>tablespoons of butter may be stirred in when it is removed from the heat</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page233"></a>Combine milk, sugar, salt, vanilla, and 3 tablespoons butter in a saucepan, bring to a boil, and slowly pour in the tapioca, stirring the while. Stir over direct heat for a minute and put the saucepan, covered, into a slow oven for about 20 minutes. Turn it out into a mixing bowl, remove the vanilla bean, stir in the rest of the butter and the yolks of the eggs, gently fold in the stiffly beaten whites, and pour into a generously buttered mold (quart size), the inside of which has been lightly sprinkled with dry tapioca. Poach in a <em>bain-marie</em> in hot, but not boiling, water in a slow-to-medium oven for about ½ hour, or until the center of the pudding is elastic to the touch. Remove from the hot water and allow it to settle for about 10 minutes before unmolding. If it is to be served chilled, leave the mold over it to protect the surface from the air until just before serving. Coat it with a bit of sauce and send the rest of the sauce to table in a separate dish.</p>
