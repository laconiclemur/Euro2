<h3 class="h3"><em>Red Mullet with Tapenade</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>Red mullet is known as the woodcock of the sea because, as with the bird, it is traditionally cooked whole, insides and all. A thick sauce is then made using the latter as a base. It’s rarely done this way now, but red mullet is still one of the most popular and certainly most strongly flavoured of Mediterranean fish, which is why I’ve partnered it with the salty strength of tapenade</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
8 large fillets of red mullet<br/>
2 medium aubergines<br/>
150ml (5fl oz) olive oil, plus a little for grilling the fish<br/>
Juice of 2 lemons<br/>
1 mild chilli, seeded and finely chopped<br/>
2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped<br/>
Salt and freshly ground pepper<br/>
250g (9oz) <em>Confit de Tomates</em> (<em><a href="chapter_006b.html#page166">see here</a></em>)<br/>
5 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves picked from the stalks<br/>
16 black olives, stoned and chopped<br/>
150g (5½ oz) recipe <em>Tapenade</em> (<em><a href="chapter_006d.html#page168">see here</a></em>)</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your grill to high.</p>
<p class="normala">Peel the aubergines and cut them into French-fry-sized sticks. Put them in a pan with 100ml (3½fl oz) of the olive oil, the juice of one of the lemons, the chilli and garlic. Cook over a moderate heat for about 15 minutes without colouring until they are soft and creamy. Season with salt and cayenne.</p>
<p class="normala">In the meantime mix 50ml (2fl oz) of olive oil with the juice of the second lemon, the <em>confit</em> tomatoes, thyme and olives. Warm lightly and season well with salt and cayenne.</p>
<p class="normala">Brush the red mullet fillets with oil, season them lightly and grill for 5 minutes, skin side up. Spread some tapenade on every second fillet and serve with the aubergine and tomato and olive dressing.</p>
