<h1 class="chapter_title1" id="h1">The Spanish Kitchen</h1>
<p class="nonindent" id="p1"><span class="dropcaps2line">D</span>ON’T GET DISCOURAGED thinking that you will need many hard-to-find ingredients or special equipment to cook good Spanish food. Most of the recipes in this book require only common pots and pans and everyday staples already in your pantry. Even when a specialty ingredient is called for, there is usually an acceptable substitute. I have often found myself cooking in a remote place where I could not find a specific ingredient or the ideal kitchen tool. That the food still turned out well is less a testament to my resourcefulness than it is to the remarkable durability of these recipes, most of which evolved over centuries in which home cooks needed to put food on the table with the materials at hand. If I suggest you use a <span class="italic">cazuela</span> (terracotta casserole) and you don’t have one, a cast-iron skillet of similar size will do the job. When a recipe calls for Spanish rice, another short-grain rice, such as Arborio from Italy, is a fine substitute. Regular paprika can stand in for <span class="italic">pimentón</span>, prosciutto for <span class="italic">jamón serrano</span>.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p2">In the typical Spanish kitchen, you would find the following specialty items, none of which is difficult to acquire in North America (see <a class="hlink" href="Barr_9781607746157_epub_bm1_r1.htm">Sources</a>).</p>
<h2 class="headerA" id="c02-sect12"><span class="red">ACEITE DE OLIVA (<a class="hlink" id="ind796a"/>Olive Oil)</span></h2>
<p class="nonindent" id="p3">When Spain, then known as Hispania, was part of the Roman Empire, it was its main supplier of olive oil, shipping the oil in amphorae to the most distant outposts of the realm. But Spain’s production was not just a question of volume. In his early-first-century cookbook, <span class="italic">De re coquinaria</span>, the wealthy and extravagant Roman merchant and gastronomist Apicius called specifically for Spanish olive oil in many of his recipes. Today, Monte Testaccio, a hundred-foot-high hill composed entirely of broken Spanish amphorae, stands on the shore of Rome’s Tiber River, evidence of that long-ago popularity.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p4">Nowadays, just as it was two millennia ago, Spain’s olive oil industry is an important player in the international market, turning out fully one-fourth of the world’s total production. To ensure the quality of Spanish oil, regulatory councils, or Denominaciones de Origen (DOs), within each producing region watch over its manufacture, affixing a DO label only if the oil meets the strict standards of the council.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p5">The terminology used to distinguish the qualities of olive oil can be confusing to the uninitiated. The term <span class="italic">aceite de oliva</span> generically refers to the oil or juice obtained from olives. In the language of the trade, however, olive oil is divided into Aceite de Oliva Virgen (virgin olive oil, or oil that has not undergone any treatment other than washing, decanting, centrifuging, and filtering) and Aceite de Oliva (oil made from a blend of virgin and refined olive oils).</p>
<p class="indent" id="p6">According to the European Union regulations of November 2003, virgin olive oils are further subdivided <a id="page40"/>into two categories: <span class="italic">extra virgen</span> (extra virgin olive oil), which has an acidity of less than 0.8 percent, and <span class="italic">virgen</span> (virgin olive oil), which has an acidity of less than 2 percent. The acidity is determined by measuring the percentage of free fatty acids, which are created when the molecular structure of the oil has degraded. When an olive oil is categorized as <span class="italic">extra</span>, it means that the oil must contain less than 0.8 gram of free fatty acids per 100 grams of olive oil.</p>
<div class="dis_img" id="div1"><img alt="" src="images/Barr_9781607746157_epub_038_r1.jpg"/></div>
<p class="indent" id="p7">Picking olives at their peak of ripeness and pressing them as soon as possible assures the lowest level of acidity, but does not necessarily yield a premium oil. For that reason, virgin olive oils are also judged on their organo-leptic characteristics, that is, on whether they have excellent taste and aroma. To minimize subjectivity in the tasting process, <span class="italic">catadores</span>, or professional testers, follow an official method called a panel test, which is determined and controlled by the regulatory councils of each Denominación de Origen.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p8">One can easily find parallels to wine tasting among the official terms employed to classify olive oils. <span class="italic">Frutado</span> describes the aroma of oil, which largely depends on the olive variety used. Each variety has its characteristic <span class="italic">frutado</span>, with notes reminiscent of almonds, apples, citrus, figs, tomatoes, or even freshly cut green grass. In taste, olive oils range from very subtle and sweet to lightly piquant with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Just as with grapes, many factors, including the soil, the climate, and the ripeness of the fruit at harvest, affect the aroma and flavor of the oil.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p9">Directly below Aceite de Oliva Virgen is what the trade calls Aceite de Oliva, which is made from a blend of <span class="italic">extra virgen</span> or <span class="italic">virgen</span> and refined <span class="italic">lampante</span> olive oils. Because they have an acidity level of higher than 2 percent and/or defects in aroma and taste, <span class="italic">lampante</span> oils must be treated with chemicals, heat, or other means to eliminate the offending characteristics. The refined oil is odorless and tasteless, and so, before it is sold, it must be blended with <span class="italic">extra virgen</span> or <span class="italic">virgen</span> oil to create Aceite de Oliva. The amount of virgin oil added can range from 15 to 40 percent, depending on the criteria of the producer. The more virgin oil added to the blend, the more taste and aroma it will have.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p10">In addition to the distinctions between <span class="italic">extra virgen</span>, <span class="italic">virgen</span>, and regular olive oil, there are also many single-varietal oils to choose from, all of which have different characteristics. They can appear either as <span class="italic">extra virgen</span> or <span class="italic">virgen</span> oils, depending on their acidity, though most bottles sold in the United States will be <span class="italic">extra virgen</span>. You can select a specific varietal oil according to how you will be using it. Just as oysters go beautifully with Champagne, and oxtails with a full-bodied red, a gazpacho is complemented by a Hojiblanca oil, and fried fish marries well with a Picual. Following are short descriptions of five of the main Spanish single-varietal oils and their characteristics.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p11">The Spanish olive oils with the strongest personality come from the pointy Picual olive, which is named for its shape. These Andalusian olives produce some of the most stable olive oils in the world because of their high oleic acid content and polyphenol count, properties that make them ideal for high-heat cooking. Picual oils made from olives grown in the mountains are slightly sweeter, with a fresh pleasant flavor, while those pressed from olives cultivated in the plains tend to have more body, with fig and fresh wood undertones. These oils are primarily used for deep-frying, popular in southern Spain, and are also suitable for use in salads and gazpachos. They are rich in antioxidants as well.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p12">Cornicabra oils from central Spain are fruity, with undertones of avocado, almonds, and apples. Their <a id="page41"/>initial sweetness on the tongue is perfectly balanced by a slightly bitter and pungent aftertaste in the throat. They are delicious in cooked dishes, such as salt cod recipes, <span class="italic">escabeches</span> (marinated foods), and meat and fish stews, as they are in salads. Their stable molecular structure makes them well suited for frying, too.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p13">Empeltre oils from Aragón and Arbequina oils from Catalonia tend to be sweeter, which doesn’t mean sugary, but simply lacking the pungent character of other varieties. Both have a subtle almond aftertaste. Taken together, these characteristics make them suitable for use in mayonnaise sauces, for seasoning salads, for scrambling or frying eggs, for preparing delicate white fish such as hake, or even for frying pastries. Because of its molecular structure, Arbequina in particular is more delicate than other varieties and thus more prone to oxidize, so store it away from light in a cool spot.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p14">Although delicate, Hojiblanca oils from Andalusia have a range of flavors, from an initial sweetness with aromatic undertones of freshly cut green grass to slightly pungent and peppery notes with hints of fresh apples and almonds. Because these oils are highly aromatic, they are wonderful additions to grilled meats and fish. Simply drizzle a little oil directly from the bottle on top just before serving. Hojiblanca oils are also perfect to use in gazpachos, salads, soups, purées, and even dough. One of the less stable varieties, this oil is not suitable for frying and should be stored in a cool, dark cupboard to preserve its fruity character and prevent or delay oxidation.</p>
<p class="center" id="p15"><img alt="" src="images/Barr_9781607746157_epub_L02_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="nonindent" id="p16">I recommend <span class="italic">extra virgen</span> or <span class="italic">virgen</span> oils for drizzling on cooked foods or salads. They are higher priced but their superior aroma and taste are appreciated when they are used raw. Regular Aceite de Oliva is well suited to frying and other cooking applications. Incidentally, the term <span class="italic">light</span> or <span class="italic">lite</span> found on olive oil bottles in U.S. supermarkets is by no means an indication of the oil’s quality or fat content. Instead, the labeling indicates that the oil contains only 5 percent virgin olive oil or less; the other 95 percent is odorless, tasteless refined oil. Simply put, it is an attempt to mislead the shopper into thinking that he or she is choosing a low-fat oil over the “regular” alternative.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p17">When frying at high temperatures (between 280° and 360°F), olive oil produces a golden crust on a food’s surface, preventing the food from absorbing too much fat. Frying should never be done at low temperatures, because the food will absorb too much oil, rendering it greasy. Because olive oil expands when heated, be sure to use deep, wide, high-sided pots for frying. Foods should be added gradually to avoid cooling the oil suddenly, and the pan should never be crowded, or the temperature of the oil will drop below optimal level. Also, between batches, always allow the oil to return to the original temperature before adding more food. When used to fry potatoes, croquettes, or bread, the oil can be reused up to four or five times. Let cool and then strain after each use. The high oleic acid and polyphenol content that makes olive oil thermally stable also gives it a significantly longer shelf life than most other oils. In discussing the specific varietal oils, I have advised you to store the more delicate ones away from the light and in a cool place, a sound rule for all olive oils.</p>
<h2 class="headerA" id="c02-sect13"><span class="red">VINAGRE (<a class="hlink" id="ind1275a"/>Vinegar)</span></h2>
<p class="nonindent" id="p18">Although the word <span class="italic">vinegar</span> is derived from the Latin <span class="italic">vinum acre</span>, or “sour wine,” vinegar making is not restricted to a grape base, as store shelves lined with bottles of malt vinegar, rice vinegar, cider vinegar, and the like illustrate. But Spanish cooks primarily use only wine vinegars, probably because of our country’s huge wine industry. We add them to salads and cold soups, such as the Andalusian gazpacho, use them for preserving raw foods, and they are an indispensable ingredient in the <span class="italic"><a class="hlink" href="Barr_9781607746157_epub_c03_r1.htm#box2">escabeche</a></span> dishes typical of Castile.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p19">Spain’s most distinctive and noteworthy vinegar—and my favorite—is <a class="hlink" id="ind1257a"/>Vinagre de Jerez, or sherry vinegar. For a long time, sherry vinegars were a well-kept secret among winemakers in the Jerez region. According to wine expert and food writer Paz Ivison, who was born and raised in Jerez, local winemakers didn’t like to acknowledge that any of their barrels “had gone,” or spoiled into vinegar, so consumption was restricted to family and close friends. <a id="page42"/>Fortunately, thanks in part to the establishment of its own Denominación de Origen in 1933, sherry vinegar is highly valued and enjoyed in Spain and abroad.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p20">According to the DO regulations, Vinagre de Jerez must be aged in oak or chestnut casks for at least six months, and Vinagre de Jerez Reserva for a minimum of two years. Quality varies depending on the aging method and the wine used as the base. Aging can be static—that is, the vinegar is aged in the same barrel from beginning to end—or the <span class="italic">solera</span> method can be used, in which small quantities of young vinegar are periodically added to barrels that contain aged vinegar.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p21">Intensely aromatic and complex, sherry vinegars are darker, stronger, and thicker than red wine vinegars. Pungently sweet and wood-scented notes are characteristic, and the taste is joyful, or <span class="italic">alegre,</span> as we say in Spanish. They produce outstanding vinaigrettes when combined with extra virgin olive oil, and add a distinctive flavor to gazpachos and sauces.</p>
<h2 class="headerA" id="c02-sect14"><span class="red"><a class="hlink" id="ind667a"/>JAMONES DE ESPAÑA (Spanish Cured <a class="hlink" id="ind648a"/>Hams)</span></h2>
<p class="nonindent" id="p22">Good proof that <span class="italic">jamón</span> is a staple of the Spanish kitchen is the sheer number and variety of <span class="italic">jamoneros</span>—the special devices made to hold an entire ham for easy slicing—found in bars and in many households across the country. Two main categories of Spanish ham exist, <a class="hlink" id="ind669a"/><span class="italic">jamón serrano</span> (ham from the sierra, or mountains) and <span class="italic">jamón ibérico</span> (ham from the <span class="italic">ibérico</span> pig). The names are somewhat misleading, however, since all hams were originally cured by cool, dry mountain breezes and known generically as <span class="italic">jamón serrano</span>. Today, the differences lie primarily in the breed, the diet, and the curing times. Both varieties are extraordinary.</p>
<h3 class="headerB" id="c02-num1"><span class="red">Jamón Serrano</span></h3>
<p class="indent" id="p23"><span class="italic">Jamón serrano</span> is made from white-coated pigs. Different breeds are used depending on the region, although Duroc-Jersey, Landrace, and Large White are preferred. Jamón de Teruel in Aragón and Jamón de Trevélez in Granada are perhaps the best known of these hams, although most regions in Spain also produce excellent hams. The dark red, firm meat is marbled with whitish fat, and it ranges from sweet to slightly salty. It tastes best when sliced thin, and no part of the ham is wasted: the tougher ends are often diced and used for cooking, and the bones go into soups and stews.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p24">The pigs are fed generous amounts of grain, and after slaughtering, their hams and shoulders are kept covered with coarse salt for an average of fourteen days. The salt is rinsed off with lukewarm water, and then the hams and shoulders are hung and air cured for at least eight months and up to twenty months or longer, depending on different grades in quality. Artisanal hams are cured in cool, naturally ventilated <span class="italic">secaderos</span>, or drying warehouses. But because of high demand, most hams are cured in large industrial sites where the humidity and temperature are electronically controlled. Hams typically lose about 30 percent of their weight in the curing process, so the average ham weighs about fourteen pounds when it is sold.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p25">The <span class="italic">jamón serrano</span> available in the United States comes from pigs slaughtered in Denmark or Holland, where several slaughterhouses have been approved by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The hams are then transported in refrigerated trucks to Spain for curing. Numerous stores in North America sell <span class="italic">jamón serrano</span>, and there are many online vendors. If necessary, other dry-cured ham, such as prosciutto, can be substituted in recipes calling for <span class="italic">jamón serrano</span>.</p>
<div class="full_page_image" id="div2"><a id="page43"/><img alt="" src="images/Barr_9781607746157_epub_039_r1.jpg"/></div>
<p class="caption" id="p26"><span class="italic">Hanging cured hams</span></p>
<h3 class="headerB" id="c02-num2"><span class="red">Jamón Ibérico</span></h3>
<p class="indent" id="p27">For the time being, it is necessary to travel to Spain to taste this phenomenal contribution to the culinary world. Widely acclaimed by foreigners and worshipped by Spaniards, <span class="italic">jamón ibérico</span> has no paragon. It is produced from the black-coated <span class="italic">ibérico</span> pig, also commonly called <span class="italic">cerdo negro</span> (black pig) or <span class="italic">pata negra</span> (black foot), though the latter is not quite accurate since not all <span class="italic">ibérico</span> pigs are black hoofed and some non-<span class="italic">ibérico</span> pigs are. According to the Denominación de Origen, <span class="italic">jamones ibérico</span> can be made from crossbred pigs, but in order to qualify, the <a id="page44"/>hybrids must be at least 75 percent <span class="italic">ibérico</span> and the balance must be Duroc-Jersey.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p28">A semidomesticated breed that over time has adjusted beautifully to Spain’s south and southwest, the <span class="italic">ibérico</span> pig lives in the <span class="italic">dehesas</span> of the provinces of Ciudad Real, Toledo, Cáceres, Badajoz, Sevilla, Huelva, and Córdoba. These vast grazing meadows and woodlands of oak and cork, the perfect habitat for the celebrated pigs, are usually fenced. During most of the year, the pigs feed on grass, herbs, olives, and roots, but during the <span class="italic">montañera</span>, the final fattening period in the fall months prior to slaughter, their diet is strictly controlled. The quality grades of the <a class="hlink" id="ind649a"/>hams directly reflect what pigs eat during the <span class="italic">montanera</span>: <span class="italic">bellota</span> (first class) hams are from pigs fed only on acorns, <span class="italic">recebo</span> (second class) hams are from pigs given a diet that combines acorns and grain, and <span class="italic">pienso</span> (third class) hams are from pigs that consume only grain. <span class="italic">Bellota</span> hams are unsurpassable; their meat is dark red and very aromatic, with an intensely nutty flavor and velvety, nonfibrous texture. It is finely marbled with a fat that is both delicious and beneficial to your health. Thanks to the pig’s acorn diet, a majority of its fat, similar to olive oil, is oleic acid, which reduces bad cholesterol (low-density lipoproteins, or LDLs) and enhances the production of good cholesterol (high-density lipoproteins, or HDLs).</p>
<p class="indent" id="p29">The fattened pigs are slaughtered in winter. They usually weigh almost four hundred pounds, and the resulting hams will weigh anywhere from twelve to twenty pounds, with the shoulders a little less. As with <a class="hlink" id="ind668a"/><span class="italic">jamón serrano</span>, the hams and shoulders from the pigs are completely drained of blood and then covered with coarse salt for about two weeks. After washing off the salt with lukewarm water, the hams and shoulders are dried and stored in cool rooms for four to six weeks. They are then hung in <span class="italic">bodegas</span> (cool cellars) for curing, which will take, depending on the weight, a minimum of nine months for hams and five months for shoulders. Good <span class="italic">jamón ibérico</span> is cured for as long as two and a half years. Toward the end of the estimated maturation time, a tester inserts a pencil-like object made of bone into the ham to check the quality—almost like checking a cake for doneness. Depending on the aroma, the hams will be released or left a little longer for further curing. Like the <span class="italic">jamón serrano</span>, the <span class="italic">jamón ibérico</span> loses about 30 percent of its initial weight in curing.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p30">The national demand for <span class="italic">jamón ibérico</span> is so large and the production is so limited—it accounts for only about 5 percent of Spain’s cured ham production—that its high price is understandable. This is also probably the reason why the majority of the <span class="italic">jamón ibérico</span> producers are not interested in trying to file a request with the USDA to approve their slaughterhouses so they can export to the United States. The ham alone is worth a trip to Spain.</p>
<h2 class="headerA" id="c02-sect15"><span class="red"><a class="hlink" id="ind374a"/>CHORIZO</span></h2>
<p class="nonindent" id="p31">Chorizo is unquestionably the national <a class="hlink" id="ind1052a"/>sausage of Spain. Usually made with pork, it is prepared in a variety of ways and comes in many shapes and sizes. Because the quality of the meats used determines the quality of the final product, chorizos made with meat from the <span class="italic">ibérico</span> pig, especially those raised in Extremadura and Salamanca, are prized as both cold cuts and for cooking. La Rioja is also known for its excellent, slightly spicy chorizo, which is an essential ingredient in <span class="italic">patatas a la riojana</span> (stewed potatoes with chorizo). Smoked chorizos from Asturias, used in <span class="italic">fabadas</span> and other bean stews, have a delicious, mildly spicy taste with a smoky finish. Venison chorizos from the mountains, particularly the Pyrenees, are increasingly popular and have a pleasant gamy flavor.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p32">Depending on the type of chorizo, the meat is usually chopped and mixed with larger or smaller quantities of fat; seasoned with salt, garlic, <span class="italic">pimentón</span>, and herbs; and then stuffed into casings. <span class="italic">Pimentón</span> is typical, although sometimes crushed <span class="italic">choricero</span> peppers, named for the important role they play in the making of chorizo, are used in its place. To make spicy chorizo, crushed <span class="italic">guindillas seca</span> (small dried hot chiles) are added to the mix. Once the mixture is in the casings, the ends of each casing are tied to form a long single sausage, or they are tied and the filled casing is twisted to form a chain of three- to four-inch links.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p33">Fresh chorizos are preserved in lard or olive oil and are used mainly for cooking. Air-cured chorizos are usually consumed as cold cuts on sandwiches or as tapas. Before <a id="page45"/>hanging the chorizos to dry, some producers, mainly in northern Spain, briefly smoke the sausages. Curing times depend on the thickness of the sausages and on the desired texture. The longer they are cured, the firmer their final texture will be.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p34">Few Spanish chorizos are exported to North America, but several North American companies produce Spanish-style chorizos (see <a class="hlink" href="Barr_9781607746157_epub_bm1_r1.htm">Sources</a>). Although these products are made from leaner meats and are therefore not as flavorful, they are a good approximation. Mexican chorizos, however, are not good substitutes. Unlike Spanish chorizos, these are often fresh, rather than cured, and very spicy, and usually they must be turned out of their casings before they are cooked.</p>
<div class="fullpageimage_flow" id="div3"><img alt="" src="images/Barr_9781607746157_epub_040_r1.jpg"/></div>
<p class="caption" id="p35"><span class="italic">Various sausages, including</span> morcilla <span class="italic">(blood sausage) and</span> chorizo, <span class="italic">in Gijón, Asturias</span></p>
<h2 class="headerA" id="c02-sect16"><span class="red">MORCILLA (Blood Sausage)</span></h2>
<p class="nonindent" id="p36">The varieties of <span class="italic">morcillla</span> are both regionally defined and nearly countless, although pork blood, lard, and condiments are always part of the mix. Some versions include rice and onion, as in the famous <a class="hlink" id="ind756a"/><span class="italic">morcilla</span> of Burgos; others add <span class="italic">pimentón</span> and black pepper for spiciness, as in the recipes of Navarra and La Rioja; and still others are laced with almonds, pine nuts, and raisins, like those of Catalonia and Valencia. Some <span class="italic">morcillas</span> are creamier, while others are firmer; some are smoked, like the sausages of Asturias that are indispensable to the famed <span class="italic">fabada asturiana</span>, and others are dry cured.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p37">Spain’s customary slaughtering season is during the coldest months of the year, which is also the traditional—and many would say still the best—time to buy artisanal fresh <span class="italic">morcillas</span>. Smoking and other curing methods, along with modern storage techniques, extend the shelf life of many other handcrafted blood sausages. Commercial brands, in contrast, are available year-round. Butcher shops and delicatessens in North America specializing in Spanish foods typically carry house-made <span class="italic">morcillas</span>, or they can be purchased online (see <a class="hlink" href="Barr_9781607746157_epub_bm1_r1.htm">Sources</a>).</p>
<h2 class="headerA" id="c02-sect17"><a id="page46"/><span class="red"><a class="hlink" id="ind569a"/><a class="hlink" id="ind1024a"/>BACALAO (Salt Cod)</span></h2>
<p class="nonindent" id="p38">Every region in Spain boasts local specialties made with <span class="italic">bacalao</span> (salt cod), but Basque cooks are the true masters. It may seem curious that the Basques developed a passion for preserved fish, given their proximity to the sea. But Basque fishermen were great seafarers—whalers originally—and they preserved their catch to make the long journey home. Soon after discovering the rich cod fishing grounds off the shores of Newfoundland, they determined that the cod’s lean meat was more suitable for salting and drying than whale meat was, and that cod tasted even better after it was cured and desalted than it did when it was fresh. Salt cod subsequently became a favorite staple back home, particularly inland, since it was the safest option for overland transport before the advent of refrigeration.</p>
<div class="dis_img" id="div4"><img alt="" src="images/Barr_9781607746157_epub_041_r1.jpg"/></div>
<p class="indent" id="p39">Salt cod is an acquired taste, but once you develop a fondness for it, you may find it difficult to go back to fresh cod. Its light saltiness and firm texture may at first be a surprise to the palate, but, if properly prepared, it almost always seduces in the end. Some Spaniards—me among them—love it so much that they even go so far as to buy fresh cod to cure, only to rehydrate it immediately for use in their favorite salt cod dishes. (The term <span class="italic">bacalao</span> refers to salt cod in general, while <span class="italic">bacalao fresco</span> refers to the fresh fish.)</p>
<p class="indent" id="p40">When I don’t salt my own cod, I usually buy the entire flat, triangular piece known as a <span class="italic">bacalada</span>. With few exceptions, good salt cod is difficult to find in North America. Even in Canada, an important participant in the international salt cod trade, good salt cod is rarely stocked in retail stores. It is worth the extra effort to try to locate it, however. In the United States, salt cod is usually sold by Portuguese vendors, although Italian and Greek shops often carry it as well. (You can also purchase it online; see <a class="hlink" href="Barr_9781607746157_epub_bm1_r1.htm">Sources</a>.) Sometimes the entire <span class="italic">bacalada</span> is available, but more often it is sold already cut into small pieces (or sometimes even shredded) without the skin. If possible, purchase cod with the skin on, as the gelatin plays a critical role in some preparations, such as <span class="italic">bacalao al pil-pil</span>, in which it helps to emulsify the sauce.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p41">I use different parts of the <span class="italic">bacalada</span> to cook different dishes. The meat is thickest, up to two inches or more, at the point at which the backbone ran through the center of the piece. It becomes thinner toward the edges, and pieces from the tail and the outer rim are the thinnest. The thinner pieces can be used when you need to shred the cod for a recipe, such as croquettes. If you are using the fish for a cod salad that calls for pieces that will yield flakes that are as large as possible and are simply prepared (that is, not cooked with flour and milk or a similar preparation), the thicker parts are preferred.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p42">The soaking times for desalting will vary with how thick the cod is. For example, the 2-inch-thick fillets necessary to create the big flakes for the salad will need to soak for thirty-six to forty-eight hours. On the other hand, if you are making <span class="italic"><a class="hlink" href="Barr_9781607746157_epub_c09_r1.htm#c09-sect148">bacalao al pil-pil</a></span>, you should use fillets that are 1½ inches thick. In this case, the fillets remain whole, and though you want them to be succulent, they should not be too thick. Pieces this size will need to soak for twenty-four to thirty-six hours. The thinner pieces, used for recipes calling for shredded cod, need to soak for only twenty-four hours.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p43"><a id="page47"/>Select a deep bowl for soaking the cod, so that it will be fully submerged in the water, and always soak it in the refrigerator. Soaking at room temperature is tricky: if the weather is warm, the water and salt will evaporate more quickly and the suggested soaking times will not be accurate. Also, if a room is very hot, as is often the case in central and southern Spain in the summertime, you risk spoilage. Once you have begun the soaking, change the water every six to eight hours.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p44">When the cod has been soaked properly, the fillets will be considerably thicker and flexible. Taste a tiny piece toward the end of the prescribed soaking time to see whether the cod has soaked long enough. It is ready when it still tastes slightly salty. If it tastes too salty, soak it a little longer. Use the reconstituted cod right away, if possible, or store it for no longer than two days in the refrigerator. You can store unsoaked salt cod in a cool, dark place or in the refrigerator for up to several weeks—or even longer.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p45">If you love salt cod as much as I do, consider salting your own fresh cod. The process, although somewhat time-consuming, gives you additional control over the level of saltiness. Buy a whole cod or just half. Ask your fishmonger to fillet it for you (this way you can avoid the nuisance of the central bone, which makes cutting the fillets more difficult) and to keep the skin intact. (Incidentally, the popular Spanish saying <span class="italic">cortar el bacalao</span>—“to cut the cod”—means to be in command or to be the boss.) Select a baking pan or dish large enough to hold the fillet, or the fillets side by side, and cover the bottom with coarse salt. Place the fillet or fillets on top—skin up or skin down makes no difference—and bury the cod with more coarse salt. The fish should be completely covered on all sides with salt. Place the cod, uncovered, in the refrigerator for forty-eight hours. Every twelve hours, carefully pour off any liquid that the fish has released, disturbing the cod as little as possible. The salt tends to dissolve when the liquid is poured off, so add more salt as needed to encase the fish.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p46">When the cod is ready, lift it out of the salt and rinse it briefly under cold running water. At this point, you can store it for up to a week before desalting it and using it. You desalt it the same way you desalt commercially salted cod, including changing the water every six to eight hours. The only difference is that the soaking time will be shorter. A freshly cured fillet about 1½ inches thick needs to soak for only twenty-four hours. Be careful not to soak it too long, or it will be bland. Again, test a small piece cut from an edge to judge the saltiness.</p>
<h2 class="headerA" id="c02-sect18"><span class="red">PIMIENTOS (<a class="hlink" id="ind866a"/>Peppers)</span></h2>
<p class="nonindent" id="p47">Given that Spain was the first European country to receive peppers from the New World, it is not surprising that many varieties of the <span class="italic">Capsicum annuum</span> species are grown there and that peppers figure prominently in regional cuisines. Peppers intended for frying <span class="italic">(pimientos para freir)</span> are usually picked while still green, at a length of four inches or less, and are generally sweet and have very thin skins. The mild and delicious <span class="italic">pimiento de Guernica</span>, called <span class="italic">Gernikako piperrak</span> in Basque, a particularly popular frying pepper, is highly valued across Spain. The Gernika and others like it are also allowed to ripen, that is, turn red, and then they are dried in the sun, crushed, and used in the making of chorizos. Another favorite frying pepper is Galicia’s <span class="italic">pimiento de Padrón</span>. It is only about two inches long and can sometimes be surprisingly hot. Part of the fun of eating <span class="italic">pimientos de Padrón</span> is that you never know who at the table will end up with tearing eyes. Grown throughout Spain, <span class="italic">pimientos para asar</span> (bell peppers), large peppers harvested both red and green, are used mostly for roasting or stewing.</p>
<h3 class="headerB" id="c02-num3"><span class="red"><a class="hlink" id="ind881a"/>Piquillos</span></h3>
<p class="indent" id="p48">Pimiento del Piquillo de Lodosa is one of Spain’s most important contributions to the culinary world. Originally from Navarra and now carefully protected by its own DO, this extraordinary pepper is enjoyed across Spain and exported worldwide. When cooking at culinary events as far away as Australia or Argentina, I have always been able to find <span class="italic">piquillos</span> in local stores.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p49"><span class="italic">Piquillos</span> are triangular, about three inches long, with an acute peak at the bottom. It is this distinctive peak, known as <span class="italic">pico</span> or <span class="italic">piquillo</span> in Spanish, that has given the peppers their name. Contrary to the misleading association with <a id="page48"/>the word <span class="italic">picante</span>, which means “hot,” these peppers, although sometimes mildly spicy, are not at all hot. <span class="italic">Piquillos</span> are harvested by hand, roasted in wood-burning ovens, which imparts an intense aroma, and then peeled by hand, exposing their bright red, shiny flesh. They are then slipped into jars or cans, always free of artificial preservatives or other chemicals. Outside Lodosa and the surrounding area, fresh <span class="italic">piquillos</span> are often difficult to find. Even locals buy them canned or jarred, primarily because the wood-burning ovens of the <span class="italic">piquillo</span> farms are far better than household ovens, and also for the convenience.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p50">One reason for the popularity of <span class="italic">piquillos</span> is their versatility. They can be eaten straight from the jar, mixed with vinaigrette in salads, sautéed in olive oil and garlic as a side dish, stuffed with meat or fish, or made into a sauce. And regardless of how you prepare them, they are always wonderful. Fortunately, they are widely available in specialty-foods stores across North America.</p>
<h3 class="headerB" id="c02-num4"><span class="red">Pimentón</span></h3>
<p class="indent" id="p51"><a class="hlink" id="ind875a"/><span class="italic">Pimentón</span>, a powder made from dried red peppers, is the famed paprika of Spain and is a staple in kitchens across the country. It comes in three basic types: <span class="italic">dulce</span> (literally “sweet,” though a better description is mild), <span class="italic">agridulce</span> (bittersweet), and <span class="italic">picante</span> (hot). It is used to season everything from fried foods, soups, and stews to meats and fish. But perhaps its most important role is in Spanish charcuterie: about 75 percent of the <span class="italic">pimentón</span> produced is destined for sausage making.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p52">Murcia is known for its <span class="italic">pimentón</span>, but the best is from the La Vera valley in Extremadura. Farmers there cultivate different peppers for each of the three types of <span class="italic">pimentón</span>: cherry-shaped peppers yield the orange-red mild powder, while long, slender dark red peppers are used for the bittersweet paprika. The hot paprika is the product of a variety of elongated peppers. These specially selected varieties, fertile soil, and excellent growing conditions all contribute to a fine product, but the real secret to La Vera <span class="italic">pimentón</span> comes later. In October, the area is full of activity: The peppers have ripened and are handpicked. Next to the fields are small, simple smokehouses, with concrete floors and wooden grids several feet above them. An oak fire is laid on the concrete floor, and the peppers are spread on the grid above the fire. The smoldering fire—only smoke, never flames—is maintained for ten to fifteen days, filling the surrounding countryside with the scent of smoking peppers. This is why <span class="italic">pimentón</span> from Extremadura has a characteristic aroma and a rich, deep flavor that are not present in <span class="italic">pimentón</span> made from sun-dried peppers. The smoked-dried peppers are seeded and stemmed and then slowly ground between millstones.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p53"><span class="italic">Pimentón</span> is increasingly available in specialty-foods markets in North America, and is also sold online (see <a class="hlink" href="Barr_9781607746157_epub_bm1_r1.htm">Sources</a>). While I recommend having all three types—sweet, bittersweet, and hot—on hand, you can get by with just the sweet variety, adding a pinch of hot red pepper flakes when a recipe calls for hot <span class="italic">pimentón</span>. Although common paprika can be used in place of <span class="italic">pimentón</span>, it is neither as complex nor as aromatic.</p>
<div class="dis_img1" id="div5"><img alt="" src="images/Barr_9781607746157_epub_042_r1.jpg"/></div>
<p class="caption" id="p54"><span class="italic">A spoonful of</span> pimentón <span class="italic">from La Vera, Extremadura</span></p>
<h3 class="headerB" id="c02-num5"><span class="red">Choriceros and Ñoras</span></h3>
<p class="indent" id="p55">Various green peppers that grow in the Basque Country and in some neighboring areas are known as <a class="hlink" id="ind373a"/><span class="italic">choriceros</span>, from their original use as a seasoning for chorizos. Smaller than green bells or even what are known as Italian peppers in the United States, these flavorful peppers are typically the length of a finger and have a thin skin and pungent aroma. <span class="italic">Choriceros</span> from the area surrounding Gernika are considered the best. In the summer, <a id="page49"/>we pick them green and eat them fried, always leaving some behind on the plants to ripen to a deep red later in the season, at which point they are harvested and hung to dry in the sun, usually until November. The dried peppers are then soaked in hot water before they are added to soups, stews, or sauces.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p56">Gernika has a traditional and popular farmers’ market on Mondays. It is only minutes away from Mundaka, where I spent wonderful summer vacations with my family, and during those visits, we went to the market every week. It was there, as a young girl, that I met my friend Felisa Madariaga, who sold fantastic peppers. Today, she is still famous throughout the area for her peppers, and I never miss a chance to visit her stand.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p57">Other regions have their own equivalents to the <span class="italic">choriceros</span> of the Basque Country, everyday peppers that are used in many dishes. <a class="hlink" id="ind790a"/><span class="italic">Ñoras</span>, from Murcia, are smaller, darker, and almost round—like a huge cherry with a flat bottom. They are typically dried in the sun and used whole in cooking or ground to make <span class="italic">pimentón</span>.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p58"><span class="italic">Choricero</span> peppers are difficult to find in North America, though they are available through online specialty retailers, as are <span class="italic">ñoras</span> (see <a class="hlink" href="Barr_9781607746157_epub_bm1_r1.htm">Sources</a>). Ancho chiles are a good substitute.</p>
<h2 class="headerA" id="c02-sect19"><span class="red"><a class="hlink" id="ind520a"/>ESPARRAGOS DE NAVARRA (<a class="hlink" id="ind97a"/>Asparagus from Navarra)</span></h2>
<p class="nonindent" id="p59">White and green asparagus are harvested in spring, and we enjoy them thoroughly throughout their short season. Fortunately, the canning industry acquires much of the production of white asparagus, making it available year-round. Labeled Esparragos de Navarra, canned white asparagus produced in Navarra’s Ribera del Ebro region is one of Spain’s most prized <span class="italic">conservas</span>.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p60">The region is known for its excellent produce: the soil is rich, the plants are carefully selected, the water for irrigation is of good quality, and the nights are cold, all of which make for outstanding growing conditions. The famed asparagus are not a product of large plantations. They are instead grown by more than five thousand small farmers across the region. At the moment when the soil around each plant starts to bulge and open a little, the asparagus are ready to be harvested. In the early morning hours, workers handpick the tender white stalks from under the earth. Because the stalks and tips have never been exposed to the sun, they remain white, instead of turning green. They are quickly taken to the canning plants, where they are first washed to remove all traces of soil, and then manually peeled and any fibrous parts are stripped away. Next, they are briefly blanched and then classified and sorted according to their size. The size depends on the age of the plant: the older the plant, the larger the stem size. (Plants remain for only seven to eight years, and are then replaced with new ones.) The tips of all spears, regardless of size, must be compact and tightly closed. Finally, the blanched and graded spears are slipped into jars or cans.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p61">Canned white asparagus are deliciously tender and have a pleasing, subtle bitterness. Larger spears are preferred for salads or are served alone with a little vinaigrette or mayonnaise. Smaller spears make an ideal tapa when served with hard-boiled eggs or salmon, or they are sometimes added to mixed-vegetable dishes or soups or cooked in <span class="italic">salsa verde</span> to accompany hake or monkfish.</p>
<h2 class="headerA" id="c02-sect20"><span class="red">AZAFRÁN (<a class="hlink" id="ind993a"/>Saffron)</span></h2>
<p class="nonindent" id="p62">Saffron, the stigmata of a small, purple crocus, is the most expensive spice on the planet and one of the most important culinary riches of Spain. It was taken to Spain by the Moors, during their westward push, and in the thirteenth century, Alfonso X of Castile wrote in his <span class="italic">Primera crónica general</span> that Spain was “joyful in saffron.” Today, such countries as Iran, Greece, India, and Morocco all produce fine saffron, but many respected authorities consider Spanish saffron the finest because of its particularly high concentration of aromatic and flavoring oils.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p63">The extraordinary price of saffron becomes understandable when you consider how labor-intensive its production is. Each plant contains only one flower with three stigmata. These valuable vibrant red stigmata on yellowish orange styles are handpicked and then meticulously dried before they are ready for consumption. You need <a id="page50"/>some five thousand flowers to produce a single ounce of saffron threads.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p64">The harvest takes place in the fall, when fields in La Mancha and Bajo Aragón, two of the country’s major saffron areas, are covered with the flowers. It is a visual thrill to drive alongside these otherwise arid stretches during harvesttime, when they look like velvety lilac sheets for as far as the eye can see.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p65">For fifteen to twenty days, toward the end of October and into the beginning of November, when the crocuses are in full bloom, the flowers, known as <span class="italic">las rosas del azafrán,</span> are handpicked at dawn and transported in baskets to nearby villages. There, women known as <span class="italic">roseras</span> pluck out the stigmata, which are then taken to facilities where any dust or floral waste is removed by hand and they are safely stored to dry.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p66">Saffron is sold either as whole stigmata (or threads), or powdered. Both forms are excellent, but the flavor and aroma of the powder dissipates more quickly over time. To make sure you have purchased high-quality, authentic saffron threads, immerse a few in water or milk. It will take a little while for true saffron to tint the liquid, while imitation saffron, an imposter treated with artificial dye, will color the liquid immediately. (Be wary of inexpensive powdered saffron, as it is sometimes mixed with other ingredients to extend it.) Store saffron threads in an airtight container in a dry place away from light for up to two years. Powdered saffron should be used within six months.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p67">Somewhat bitter tasting at first, saffron has an exotic and pungent aroma that vaguely recalls dried grass. Always use it sparingly in your cooking; too much can overpower other flavors and ruin a dish. Saffron is more popular in southern Spain than in the north, and it is used mainly in paellas and other <a class="hlink" id="ind962a"/>rice dishes, fish soups, and meat and fish stews. Before adding saffron to most dishes, crush the threads in a mortar and then soak them in a little warm liquid. Just a pinch of saffron will be enough to season a paella for four people. A small box goes a long way and is worth its price!</p>
<h2 class="headerA" id="c02-sect21"><span class="red">ARROZ (Rice)</span></h2>
<p class="nonindent" id="p68">The three main rice-growing regions of Spain are located in the east, along the Mediterranean, and each has its own DO: Arroz del Delta del Ebro in the Catalan province of Tarragona; Arroz de Valencia in the Valencian provinces of Castellón, Valencia, and Alicante; and Arroz de Calasparra in the province of Murcia and neighboring Albacete, near the southern border of Castile. The preferred varieties, each of them yielding round, short or medium grains, are Bahía, Senia, Leda, Balilla, and Bomba. All are considered ideal for paella and other Spanish rice dishes because they absorb large quantities of liquid and the flavors of other ingredients.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p69">Spain’s <span class="italic">maestros arroceros</span>, or “rice masters,” are highly discerning when selecting from among these varieties. They prefer Bomba for cooking paellas because the grain is harder and stays whole. They generally use the other varieties, although suitable for making paellas, for rice casseroles. Home cooks typically have a favorite rice for everyday cooking, using it for both their paellas and all their other rice dishes. They are seldom aware of the variety, reaching instead for the brand that they have grown to like.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p70">Spanish rice, in particular the Bomba variety, is increasingly available in the United States and Canada. Italian Arborio rice and the Japanese short-grain rice used for sushi can be used in place of a Spanish rice. Never stir either of them during cooking, however, or you may break the grains, which will cause the finished dish to be sticky.</p>

<div class="textbox_header" id="div7"><a id="page51"/><span class="red_ornament"><img alt="" class="inline" src="images/Barr_9781607746157_epub_L01_r1.gif"/></span> <span class="red"><a class="hlink" id="ind512a"/>Equipment</span> <span class="red_ornament"><img alt="" class="inline" src="images/Barr_9781607746157_epub_L01_r1.gif"/></span></div>
<div class="textbox_text" id="div8">Nearly every Spanish home kitchen is equipped with an array of <a class="hlink" id="ind333a"/><span class="italic">cazuelas</span> in different sizes, at least one medium-sized paella pan, and a <a class="hlink" id="ind764a"/>mortar and pestle for grinding spices and other ingredients for sauces and <span class="italic">mojos</span>. You should have these, too, if you want to cook authentic Spanish dishes. Other everyday Spanish utensils, from blenders to food processors, knives to tongs, stew pots to saucepans, are essentially the same as those found in most North American kitchens. Simply put, you don’t need a lot of specialized equipment to prepare a Spanish meal. That said, I recommend that you stock your kitchen with the following four pieces of equipment for ease in making the recipes in this book.</div>
<div class="textbox_subheader" id="box1-sub1"><span class="red">Cazuela</span></div>
<div class="textbox_text_indent" id="div9"><span class="italic">Cazuelas</span>, lead-free, glazed earthenware casseroles, can be used both in the oven and on the stove top. In the past, these emblematic Spanish cooking vessels could not withstand the direct heat of a burner unless they were soaked in water for a full day before using, and even then a heat-diffuser was often advised. In contrast, the <span class="italic">cazuelas</span> manufactured nowadays work beautifully on the stove top even over high heat.</div>
<div class="textbox_text_indent" id="div10">For cooking such dishes as <span class="italic"><a class="hlink" href="Barr_9781607746157_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03-sect38">gambas al ajillo</a></span>, the ideal size is about 5 inches in diameter. Even if I am cooking for four, I prefer to use four small <span class="italic">cazuelas</span>, known as <span class="italic">cazuelitas</span>, rather than one large one, because they match the size of the burners, ensuring that the heat is evenly distributed. For moist rice dishes, such as <span class="italic"><a class="hlink" href="Barr_9781607746157_epub_c08_r1.htm#c08-sect140">arros brut</a></span> or <span class="italic"><a class="hlink" href="Barr_9781607746157_epub_c08_r1.htm#c08-sect132">arroz de la huerta</a></span>, <span class="italic">cazuelas</span> measuring between 10 and 15 inches in diameter are ideal. When using these large <span class="italic">cazuelas</span> on the stove top, be sure to rotate them in a circular motion on the burner periodically to help distribute the heat evenly.</div>
<div class="textbox_text_indent" id="div11">If you don’t have a <span class="italic">cazuela</span>, a cast-iron skillet, a sauté pan, or another type of flameproof earthenware casserole, all of a similar size, can be used in its place. However, given their relatively modest cost, <span class="italic">cazuelas</span> are excellent investments if you are even modestly serious about cooking Spanish food. As a precaution, soak a newly purchased <span class="italic">cazuela</span> in cold water overnight before using it for the first time on the stove top, and always heat it gradually, even when cooking over high heat; abrupt changes in heat level can cause cracking.</div>
<div class="textbox_subheader" id="div12"><span class="red">Paella Pan</span></div>
<div class="textbox_text_indent" id="div13">Stainless-steel paella <a class="hlink" id="ind832a"/>pans are both beautiful and superior to regular steel paella pans. But considering that they also cost twice as much, I prefer steel pans. Always choose a pan according to the size of the paella you are making; a pan too large or too small for the amount of ingredients will result in uneven cooking. I recommend a 13-inch pan for a paella to serve four, a 15-inch pan for a paella to serve six, and an 18-inch pan for serving eight.</div>
<div class="textbox_subheader" id="div14"><span class="red"><a class="hlink" id="ind595a"/>Food Mill</span></div>
<div class="textbox_text_indent" id="div15">A food mill is indispensable for certain sauces. Though a blender or food processor are useful for many tasks, they tend to crush and beat food particles, which can alter color and consistency. In contrast, a food mill, which usually comes equipped with interchangeable plates with holes of different sizes, purées a sauce by gently passing it through the disk. It also neatly traps any seeds and peels in the mill, rather than whirring them into the sauce. You will be using the medium-holed plate for most of the recipes in this book. In a pinch, a medium-mesh sieve can be used, though the results will not be as good.</div>
<div class="textbox_subheader" id="div16"><span class="red">Mortar and Pestle</span></div>
<div class="textbox_text_indent" id="div17">Mortars are typically made out of stone, marble, cast iron, or wood. I grew up in a kitchen with a marble mortar, but in recent years I have used mortars made of other materials with success. If you are new to working with a mortar, you will find that when you use it to grind garlic, dried peppers, almonds or other nuts, and saffron or other spices, you have better control over the final texture of the ingredients.</div>
