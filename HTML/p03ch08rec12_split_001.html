<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Whole fish cooked encased in a sea salt crust is deliciously moist and flavorful. It is a fisherman’s way in areas where they have salt pans. They bury the fish in damp salt crystals in wooden boxes and take them to be cooked in the local bread oven. I had trouble producing a firm crust that came away cleanly, taking away the skin with it, as many recipes tell you it should do. José María Conde de Ybarra (see page 412), said that the salt must be wet enough to stick together and that you need thick layers (of three fingers deep) on top of and below the fish. I found it easier, and without using too much salt, to make a crust that comes away relatively cleanly by mixing the salt with egg white. And if the skin does not come off with the crust, it does not matter. The scales will come off.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">You can use sea bass or gray mullet instead of bream. Ask the fishmonger to gut the fish through a small incision so that the salt does not get inside and to keep the scales on—this is very important. You must use coarse sea salt or kosher salt, which will draw out moisture from the fish, not fine salt, which would be absorbed by the flesh. This is good served with boiled new potatoes.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 2</span></p>
<p class="qun">4½ pounds coarse sea salt or kosher salt</p>
<p class="qun">2 to 3 large egg whites</p>
<p class="qun">2 whole bream (14 ounces to 1 pound each), gutted but not scaled</p>
<p class="qun">Extra virgin olive oil for drizzling</p>
<p class="qun">2 lemon wedges</p>
<p class="qun1">A small bowl of <span class="italic">Alioli</span> (page 141)</p>
<p class="recsum">Line a baking pan large enough to hold the fish with a sheet of foil. Mix the salt thoroughly in a bowl with enough of the egg whites so that it feels like wet sand. Make a bed for each fish with about one-third of this mixture on the foil, and place the fish on it. Then cover the fish entirely with a thick layer of the rest of the salt mixture, molding it firmly around each fish so that it is completely covered and making sure that the opening in the belly is closed so that salt does not get in. You can leave the tails uncovered.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Bake in a preheated 400°F oven for 25 minutes. The top layer of salt will form a hard crust. To serve, crack open the crust with a heavy knife and carefully remove it. The skin may come off with it—but for me, it does not. Brush off any bits of salt and peel off any skin, then gently lift off the top fillets and transfer them to a platter or plates. Pull out the backbone and lift off the remaining fillets.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Serve with a drizzle of olive oil, accompanied by the lemon wedges and <span class="italic">alioli.</span></p>
