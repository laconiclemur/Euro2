<p class="noindentb">I think of fish as a summertime meal. I enjoy preparing this swordfish dish on my gas grill. It may also be cooked on a charcoal barbecue, or baked and then finished under the broiler. Serve it with grilled vegetables and a tomato salad.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">6 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice (from about 2 lemons)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Two 3<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub>-inch-thick swordfish steaks (about 2 pounds in all)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 lemon, cut into quarters</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">Stir the olive oil and 3 tablespoons of the lemon juice in a glass baking dish. Add the swordfish and marinate for 10 minutes, turning the steaks over once. Place the fish on a lightly oiled cooking rack, or oil the rack of the grill. Grill the fish on one side to sear and warm through, about 5 minutes. Turn, and drizzle the remaining 3 tablespoons lemon juice on the swordfish. Grill until the fish is cooked through and easily breaks into sections, about 5 minutes more. Serve immediately, garnished with the lemon quarters.</p>
