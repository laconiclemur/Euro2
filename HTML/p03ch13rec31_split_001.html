<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">This is a Spanish take on the French</span> gâteau Basque, <span class="italic">a flaky-crust pie filled with custard. It is both easier and more delicious, with its combination of crisp, light puff pastry and luscious</span> crema franchipán<span class="italic">—almond custard. The flavoring for the filling can be vanilla or grated orange zest, but my favorite is rum. I used a store-bought puff pastry sheet weighing 13 ounces and measuring about 13¾ by 8¾ inches. The pastries are best eaten warm. You must try them. Another name for them is</span> milhojas caliente <span class="italic">(hot</span> millefeuilles<span class="italic">).</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">MAKES 8 PASTRIES</span></p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE CUSTARD FILLING</span></p>
<p class="qun">¾ cup superfine sugar</p>
<p class="qun">5 large egg yolks</p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="qun">2¼ cups whole milk</p>
<p class="qun">¾ cup blanched whole almonds, coarsely ground in a food processor</p>
<p class="qun">3 tablespoons rum</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE PASTRY</span></p>
<p class="qun">13-ounce sheet of puff pastry (measuring 13¾ × 8¾ inches)</p>
<p class="qun">1 egg yolk, beaten with 1 teaspoon water, for egg wash</p>
<p class="qun1">Confectioners’ sugar for dusting (optional)</p>
<p class="recsum">For the custard, with an electric mixer, beat the sugar with the 5 egg yolks in a large bowl to a smooth, very pale cream. Beat in the flour until thoroughly mixed.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Bring the milk to a boil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Very gradually pour into the egg mixture, beating constantly until well blended. Pour this back into the pan and stir constantly over low heat with a wooden spoon until the cream thickens. If lumps form at the start, they will disappear as you work the cream vigorously. Remove from the heat and stir in the almonds and rum.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Unroll the pastry and cut it into 8 rectangles. Place them on a lightly oiled sheet of foil on a baking sheet, and brush the tops with the egg wash. Bake in a preheated 400°F oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until the pastries have puffed up and are golden brown.</p>
<p class="recsum1">When the pastries have cooled a little, cut each horizontally in half with a serrated knife and fill each one with about ⅓ cup of the custard. (If you make the pastries in advance, you can heat them through briefly in a low oven before serving.) If you like, dust with confectioners’ sugar.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATIONS</span></p>
<p class="bl-first">• Omit the rum and add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract to the milk.</p>
<p class="bl-last">• Omit the rum and stir the grated zest of 1 orange into the custard.</p>
