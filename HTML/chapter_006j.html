<h3 class="h3"><em>Dried Orange Zest</em></h3>
<p class="normall"><em>Dried orange peel has been a gem of a discovery for me. It sits in a jar in my kitchen looking pretty unassuming, but just a few strips add a Provençal fragrance to any dish. It perks up bouillabaisse and, along with a few dried ceps, it is vital in a daube niçoise, really making it stand out from those of Bordeaux or Burgundy. I’ll certainly no longer entertain the thought of a cooked tomato dish without a few strips casting their scent and spell</em>.</p>
<p class="normal1">Preheat your oven to around 80°C/175°F/very low gas.</p>
<p class="normala">Remove the zest but not pith of 5–6 large oranges in long strips using a vegetable peeler. Scatter the zest strips in a single layer on either a non-stick tray or a cake rack over a tray. Place into the preheated, very low oven, and leave for 6 hours (overnight is ideal), until they are dry enough to snap in your fingers. Allow to cool, then store in a sealed jar or an airtight box. They will keep for virtually forever, so long as the container is airtight.</p>
