  <p class="center-para"><a id="page_109"/>I love the smell of roasted meat slowly cooking in the oven – just by the smell I know it’s a Sunday morning. Since living in England, I have become accustomed to enjoying a ‘roast dinner’ and look forward to the weekly ritual, whether it’s traditional roast beef and Yorkshire pudding, pork with apple sauce or a stuffed roast chicken, all served with lovely roast potatoes and vegetables.</p>

  <p class="center-para">Italians enjoy roasts too, but as they tend to be served after a <em>primo</em> (first course) of perhaps pasta or risotto, there is less need for so many accompaniments and the meat is often simply served with a salad. Classic Italian roasts of beef, veal, pork and lamb tend to be laden with herbs, which really enhance the flavour of the meat; my <em><a href="../Text/chapter06.html#ch6sec1">Arrosto di manzo alle erbe</a></em> is a good example.</p>

  <p class="center-para">Oven roasting is a very similar process to spit roasting – cooking meat over an open fire – which has been done since ancient times. Spit roasting ensured that no part of the meat dried out as it turned on the spit and fat and juices ran over the surface of the meat. Spit roasting whole lambs, goats and pigs remains popular in Sardinia. <em>Porceddu</em> (suckling pig) infused with local myrtle leaves is cooked in this way in rural areas of the island and for celebrations like weddings. Another ancient method still used in inland parts of Sardinia is <em>incarralzadu</em>, in which the animal is cooked underground in a large hole and a fire made above. Sardinians have always been very traditional in their ways, probably because of their island location, and this way of cooking is still very much alive and celebrated today.</p>

  <p class="center-para">Oven roasting, where the heat takes a long time to reach the centre of the food, is mostly used to cook tender joints of meat. Pot-roasting allows you to use tougher, more economical, cuts of meat and is very popular in Italy; in this method, a large piece of meat is first browned, then cooked slowly with liquid. Both methods are very simple: once in the pot or roasting tin, you can more or less leave the meat to its own devices – just remember to baste the oven joint and ensure there is enough liquid for the pot roast.</p>

  <h3 class="h3a">Roast beef with herbs</h3>

  <p class="image"><a id="page_111"/><img alt="Illustration" src="../Images/f0111-01.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="chap-para">Delicious, easy to prepare, full of the fresh flavour of herbs, roast beef Italian-style is the perfect Sunday lunch. Italians usually enjoy a first course of pasta or risotto followed by the roast beef served with a simple salad.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Serves 4–6</p>

  <p class="ing">2 carrots, sliced lengthways</p>

  <p class="ing">1.4kg/3lb 2oz topside of beef</p>

  <p class="ing">100ml/3½fl oz/scant ½ cup extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing">3 garlic cloves, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing">needles from 3 sprigs of rosemary, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing">small bunch of thyme, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tbsp finely chopped marjoram</p>

  <p class="ing">a handful of parsley, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing2">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="step">Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6.</p>

  <p class="step">Put the carrots in a roasting tin and place the beef on top (this prevents the meat from sticking to the tin). Combine the olive oil, garlic, herbs, salt and pepper and pour over the meat, rubbing well. Roast in the oven for 20 minutes, then cover with foil and continue to roast for 1¼ hours, turning the meat over after 30 minutes.</p>

  <p class="step1">Remove from the oven and leave to rest for 10 minutes. Slice and serve.</p>

  <h3 class="h3"><a id="page_112"/><a id="ch6sec2"/>Pastizada alla Veneta</h3>

  <h3 class="h3a">Venetian pot roast</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">This classic Venetian pot-roast, traditionally made with horsemeat, is slow-cooking at its best; the meat is left to marinate overnight in vinegar and spices before being slow-cooked with a little white wine, Marsala and the spices from the marinade. The end result is very tender beef with the aromatic flavour of the spices. Carve fairly thick slices, otherwise the beef will fall apart. Serve with runny polenta (cornmeal) for a hearty Venetian meal.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing">1.5kg/3lb 5oz topside of beef</p>

  <p class="ing">100ml/3½fl oz/scant ½ cup extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing">1 onion, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing">4 tbsp dry white wine</p>

  <p class="ing">4 tbsp Marsala wine</p>

  <p class="ing1">200ml/7fl oz/scant 1 cup <a href="../Text/chapter01.html#pg21">beef stock</a> or <a href="../Text/chapter01.html#pg32">vegetable stock</a></p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the marinade</p>

  <p class="ing">500ml/18fl oz/2 cups red wine vinegar</p>

  <p class="ing">2 garlic cloves, left whole</p>

  <p class="ing">2 celery stalks, sliced</p>

  <p class="ing">2 sprigs of rosemary</p>

  <p class="ing">2 cloves</p>

  <p class="ing">a pinch of ground cinnamon</p>

  <p class="ing">a pinch of salt</p>

  <p class="ing">6 black peppercorns</p>

  <p class="ing"><br/></p>

  <p class="ing"><br/></p>

  <p class="step">Combine the marinade ingredients, pour over the beef, cover with clingfilm (plastic wrap) and leave in the fridge to marinate overnight.</p>

  <p class="step">Remove the meat from the marinade, pat dry with kitchen paper and set aside. Strain the marinade, reserving the vegetables and herbs. Cut a piece of greaseproof (waxed) paper slightly larger than the diameter of your cooking pot and lightly grease.</p>

  <p class="step">Heat the olive oil in a flameproof pot, add the onion and the vegetables from the marinade and sweat on a medium heat for 5 minutes. Remove the vegetables and set aside. Add the beef and brown well all over; season with salt and pepper. Add the wine, Marsala and stock, reduce the heat, then cover with the greaseproof paper and the lid and cook on a gentle heat for 2½ hours.</p>

  <p class="step1">Remove the meat and set aside on a board. Pass the sauce through a fine sieve into a small pan and, using a small whisk, beat the sauce so it is well amalgamated. Carve the meat into thick slices, pour over the sauce and serve with runny polenta.</p>

  <h3 class="h3"><a id="page_113"/><a id="ch6sec3"/>Manzo di Rovato all’olio</h3>

  <h3 class="h3a">Pot-roasted beef with extra virgin olive oil</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">This ancient dish, originating from the town of Rovato in Lombardy, northern Italy, is about 500 years old. At the time it was a dish cooked for the wealthy: they could afford not only meat but also ‘exotic’ ingredients such as anchovies and capers brought to Rovato by merchants travelling from Venice to Milan. The meat used for this dish is known in Italy as <em>cappello del prete</em> (priest’s hat), which is a triangular cut of beef from the outer part of the shoulder, ideally suited to slow cooking; chuck eye is the nearest equivalent and a good butcher should be able to provide it. The olive oil is an important part of the dish, so please do use good-quality extra virgin. The extra sauce can be served the next day with some runny polenta.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing">200ml/7fl oz/scant 1 cup extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing">1.2kg/2lb 10oz chuck eye or chuck beef joint or feather steak</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tbsp capers, rinsed</p>

  <p class="ing">4 anchovy fillets</p>

  <p class="ing">2 onions, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing">1 celery stalk, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing">3 carrots, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing">500ml/18fl oz/2 cups dry white wine</p>

  <p class="ing">3 courgettes (zucchini), sliced</p>

  <p class="ing">30g/1oz Parmesan, grated</p>

  <p class="ing">20g/¾oz/scant ¼ cup dried breadcrumbs</p>

  <p class="ing2">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="step">Heat the olive oil in a large flameproof pot, add the beef and brown well on all sides on a high heat. Add the capers and anchovies and cook on a medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon until the anchovies have dissolved. Stir in the onions, celery and carrots, pour in the wine, cover with a lid and cook on a low heat for 1 hour.</p>

  <p class="step">Add the courgettes and continue to cook for a further 1 hour.</p>

  <p class="step">Remove the meat from the pot and set aside. Using a food processor or blender, blend the vegetables and liquid until smooth. Stir in the Parmesan and breadcrumbs and season with salt and pepper to taste. Slice the meat and serve with the sauce.</p>

  <div class="box">
    <p class="box-head">For a slow cooker</p>

    <p class="box-para">Brown the meat, add the capers, anchovies and vegetables as above, then add 400ml/14fl oz/1⅔ cups of wine. Bring to the boil, then transfer everything to a large slow cooker pot. Cover and cook on High for 4 hours. Turn the beef over, then add the sliced courgettes and cook on Low for 1–1½ hours. Blend the sauce and serve as above.</p>

  <p class="chap-para">This traditional southern Italian Sunday lunch dish is one of my favourites and very reminiscent of my childhood. Each region makes its own version and my family would make it with local cheese and salami. This is a Sicilian version, hence the Italian title, using caciocavallo cheese; if you can’t find it in your Italian deli, you can substitute provolone, pecorino (romano) or Parmesan. Beef brisket is ideal for slow cooking and the tasty filling turns this economical cut of meat into a meal fit for a king. Italians usually serve the tomato sauce with pasta for a starter and the meat as a main course with a green salad. If you have leftover tomato sauce, you can freeze it for another time.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Serves 4–6</p>

  <p class="ing">700g/1lb 9oz beef brisket</p>

  <p class="ing">2 slices of mortadella</p>

  <p class="ing">3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing">1 small onion, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing">100g/3½oz fresh breadcrumbs</p>

  <p class="ing">50g/1¾oz caciocavallo cheese, grated</p>

  <p class="ing">70g/2½oz salami, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing">20g/¾oz sultanas (golden raisins), soaked in lukewarm water to soften, drained</p>

  <p class="ing">20g/¾oz/generous 2 tbsp pine nuts</p>

  <p class="ing">a handful of parsley, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the sauce</p>

  <p class="ing">3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing">1 small onion</p>

  <p class="ing">a handful of basil leaves</p>

  <p class="ing">175ml/6fl oz/¾ cup red wine</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tbsp tomato purée (paste), diluted with a little lukewarm water</p>

  <p class="ing2">1kg/2lb 4oz tomato passata (strained tomatoes)</p>

  <p class="step">Put the beef flat on a board. Make a cut halfway through the centre of the meat, then carefully slice horizontally through both sides of the meat so that it opens out like a book. Flatten slightly with a meat tenderizer, line with the mortadella slices and set aside.</p>

  <p class="step">Heat the olive oil in a saucepan, add the onion and sweat until softened. Stir in the breadcrumbs until all the oil has been absorbed, remove from the heat and leave to cool. Add the cheese, salami, sultanas, pine nuts and parsley and combine well together. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Spread the mixture over the mortadella. Carefully roll the meat and tie securely with kitchen string to ensure the filling does not escape. Set aside.</p>

  <p class="step">To make the sauce, heat the olive oil in a large flameproof pot, add the meat and brown well on all sides. Add the onion and sweat until softened. Stir in the basil leaves, add the wine and allow to evaporate, then add the diluted tomato purée, passata, and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat, cover with a lid and cook on a low heat for 3 hours. Halfway through cooking, very carefully turn the meat over, and from time to time baste the meat with the tomato sauce.</p>

  <p class="step">Carefully remove the meat from the sauce, place on a serving dish, discard the string and carve into slices, serving with a little of the sauce. Use the remaining sauce to dress freshly cooked pasta.</p>

  <h3 class="h3a">Braised beef in Barolo wine</h3>

  <p class="image"><a id="page_118"/><img alt="Illustration" src="../Images/f0118-01.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="chap-para">This classic Piemontese dish, made with the region’s famous Barolo wine, is fit for a king. It can, of course, be made with other, less expensive, full-bodied red wines, but for a special occasion I like to use Barolo. The meat is first marinated overnight with vegetables, herbs and wine before being slow-cooked with the same ingredients, giving the meat its richness. Delicious served with polenta (cornmeal), as is traditional in Piedmont, and also good with mashed potatoes.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="step">Remove the meat from the marinade and pat dry with kitchen paper. Strain the marinade, reserving the liquid, vegetables and herbs.</p>

  <p class="step">Heat the oil and butter in a large flameproof pot, add the beef and brown well all over. Remove and set aside. In the same pot, add the vegetables and herbs from the marinade and sweat on a medium heat for about 3 minutes. Return the meat to the pan, add some salt and pepper and cook on a medium heat for 5 minutes. Increase the heat, add the wine from the marinade and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to low, partially cover with a lid and cook gently for 2½ hours, until the meat is tender, turning the meat over from time to time.</p>

  <p class="step">Remove the meat and set aside. Increase the heat and cook the sauce for about 5 minutes, until it has reduced slightly. Slice the meat and serve with the vegetables and sauce, with polenta or mashed potatoes.</p>

  <p class="chap-para">This recipe evolved from memories of a pasta dish I once enjoyed in Sicily. To the pesto of almonds and olives, I added a hint of <a id="pg120"/>cinnamon, giving it that subtle North African flavour which is so often present in Sicilian dishes.

  <h3 class="h3a">Roasted pork shins with oranges</h3>

  <p class="image"><a id="page_123"/><img alt="Illustration" src="../Images/f0123-01.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="chap-para"><em>Stinco</em> (shin or shank) is popular throughout Italy, both for slow roasting and, in the case of pork shins, also for curing into salami and sausages. When buying pork shanks, bear in mind that although they look quite large, the majority of the weight consists of bone, so one shank has only enough meat for two people. The meat is well suited to long, slow cooking and the fact that it is on the bone makes this pork cut extremely tasty. The addition of oranges really brings out the flavour of the meat in this simple-to-prepare and unusual Sunday roast.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing">2 pork shins, about 1.5kg/3lb 5oz each</p>

  <p class="ing">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing">4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing">2 red onions, finely sliced</p>

  <p class="ing">2 carrots, sliced lengthways</p>

  <p class="ing">2 sprigs of rosemary</p>

  <p class="ing">300ml/10fl oz/1¼ cups <a href="../Text/chapter01.html#pg32">vegetable stock</a> – or use a stock cube</p>

  <p class="ing">4 oranges, plus grated zest and juice of 2 oranges</p>

  <p class="ing2">125g/4½oz/generous ½ cup granulated sugar</p>

  <p class="step">Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6. Put the shins in a roasting tin, rub all over with salt and pepper and drizzle with the olive oil. Roast in the oven for 1 hour.</p>

  <p class="step">Add the vegetables, rosemary, wine and stock to the roasting tin and continue to cook for another 1½ hours.</p>

  <p class="step">Meanwhile, prepare the oranges and sauce. Peel 4 oranges and cut into 1cm/½-inch slices. Bring some water to the boil in a small pan, add the orange slices, boil for 1 minute, then remove, drain and set aside. Put the juice of 2 oranges in a small pan with the sugar and 125ml/4fl oz/½ cup water and cook on a medium heat, stirring all the time, until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>

  <p class="step">About 15 minutes before the end of the pork’s cooking time, add the orange slices to the roasting tin and pour over the orange sauce.</p>

  <p class="step1">When the pork shins are cooked, put them on a large serving dish together with the vegetables, orange slices and juices. Sprinkle all over with orange zest and leave to rest for 5 minutes. Carve and serve.</p>

  <h3 class="h3a">Roast pork loin with honey and walnuts</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">Pork loin is a popular cut for roasting. You can buy it on the bone, with the loin ribs attached, or boneless and tied with string to keep it together. In this recipe I have wrapped pancetta over a boneless joint to keep the pork moist during cooking; the addition of onion, walnuts and honey gives this dish its delicious flavour.</p>

  <h3 class="h3a">Christmas capon</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">Capons are castrated roosters; larger than chickens but smaller than turkeys, they are eaten for Christmas in northern Italy, where they are bred specially for this time of year. Traditionally castrated on the day of Saint Rocco (16 August), the capons are then fattened up for four months. During this time they loose their rooster-like qualities, become calmer and more manageable, and develop more tender and succulent flesh. I really like capon and usually have one, stuffed with a mixture of seasonal fruits and nuts, for Christmas lunch.</p>

  <p class="ing">140g/5oz dried apricots, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing">140g/5oz prunes, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing">12 walnuts, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing">300g/10½oz chestnuts, cooked and finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing">250g/9oz salami, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing">a handful of thyme leaves</p>

  <p class="ing">140g/5oz bread, soaked in a little lukewarm water, drained and roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ing">50g/1¾oz Parmesan, grated</p>

  <p class="ing2">200ml/7fl oz/scant 1 cup Marsala wine</p>

  <p class="step">Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6.</p>

  <p class="step">Rub salt and pepper all over the capon and inside the cavity and set aside.</p>

  <p class="step">Combine all the stuffing ingredients, season with salt and pepper to taste and use to fill the cavity of the capon. Drizzle a little olive oil in a roasting tin, add the capon, cover with pancetta slices and drizzle with a little more olive oil. Cover with foil and roast for 1½ hours, basting with the juices from time to time. Remove the foil and pancetta slices and roast for another 30 minutes or until thoroughly cooked. To test whether the capon is cooked, insert a skewer in the thigh – if the juices run clear, it is done.</p>

  <p class="step1">Remove from the oven and leave to rest for 10 minutes. Carve and serve with the stuffing.</p>

  <p class="image"><a id="page_127"/><img alt="Illustration" src="../Images/f0127-01.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="chap-para">For a special occasion or Sunday lunch, this dish is a must. The combination of baby onions, black olives, anchovies, garlic and peas marry well with the succulent lamb. If you can’t find Taggiasca olives, substitute Greek Kalamata olives, which give a distinct tangy taste. For 4 people, half a leg of lamb is sufficient.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing">1.2kg/2lb 10oz half leg of lamb</p>

  <p class="ing">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing">a little extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing">150ml/5fl oz/⅔ cup dry white wine</p>

  <p class="step">Add half the wine and cook for a further 20 minutes. Add the remaining wine, onions, olives, garlic and anchovies, cover with foil and continue roasting for 1 hour 10 minutes.</p>

  <h3 class="h3a">Roasted duck with apple and sage</h3>

  <p class="image"><a id="page_128"/><img alt="Illustration" src="../Images/f0128-01.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="chap-para">Duck and apple is a perfect marriage, and this dish makes a great alternative for Christmas or for a Sunday lunch. For this recipe, I have used the excellent English Gressingham duck. Keep the drained-off fat and use for roast potatoes to accompany the duck.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing">1 oven-ready duck, weighing about 1.8kg/4lb</p>

  <p class="ing">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing">30g/1oz/2 tbsp butter</p>

  <p class="ing">1 onion</p>

  <p class="ing">8 sage leaves, finely chopped, plus a few extra</p>

  <p class="ing">3 tbsp fresh breadcrumbs</p>

  <p class="ing">2 egg yolks</p>

  <p class="ing">2 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ing2">100ml/3½fl oz/scant ½ cup dry white wine</p>

  <p class="step">Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas mark 4.</p>

  <p class="step">Wipe the duck clean inside and out, season the cavity with salt and pepper and set aside.</p>

  <p class="step">Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the onion and sweat on a medium heat for 3 minutes. Add 2 tbsp water and continue to cook for 2 minutes until the onion has softened. Remove from the heat, stir in the chopped sage, breadcrumbs, egg yolks, apples, and some salt and pepper and combine well. Fill the cavity of the duck with this stuffing.</p>

  <p class="step">Prick the duck skin all over and sprinkle with salt – this will release the fat and make the duck skin nice and crisp. Put the duck on a rack in a roasting tin and roast for 45 minutes.</p>

  <p class="step">Pour off the fat and reserve to make roast potatoes. Drizzle the duck with the wine, scatter with a few sage leaves and continue to roast for about 1¼ hours, until the duck is cooked; test by inserting a skewer in the thigh – if the juices run clear, it is done.</p>

  <p class="step1">Remove from the oven, pour off the fat and leave to rest for 5–10 minutes. Carve and serve with the stuffing.</p>

  <p class="chap-para">This is a really simple dish to prepare: put all your ingredients in a roasting dish and pop in the oven to do the rest. All the flavours infuse together and the alcohol and mustard give the chicken a real kick! Excellent for an easy Sunday lunch or midweek meal served with steamed rice.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing">150ml/5fl oz/⅔ cup dry white wine</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tbsp English mustard</p>

  <p class="ing">850g/1lb 14oz chicken thighs and drumsticks</p>

  <p class="ing">100g/3½oz prosciutto, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ing">10 baby onions or shallots, peeled</p>

  <p class="ing">225g/8oz baby vine tomatoes, halved</p>

  <h3 class="h3a">Mixed roasted root vegetables</h3>

  <p class="image"><a id="page_132"/><img alt="Illustration" src="../Images/f0132-01.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="chap-para">When I cook roasted meat or poultry, I like to make a tray of roasted vegetables as an accompaniment. I usually put in whatever vegetables are lying around, toss them with some extra virgin olive oil, seasoning and herbs and slow-roast them in the wood-fired oven. I tend not to peel vegetables like potatoes and carrots because a lot of essential nutrients are in the skin, but I leave it to you. You can use whatever root vegetables you like: if you don’t have celeriac, for example, use extra carrots or parsnips. In warmer months, I use vegetables such as peppers, courgettes (zucchini), aubergines (eggplants) and baby new potatoes.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing">4 large potatoes, scrubbed and cut into quarters</p>

  <p class="ing">2 large carrots, scrubbed and cut in half lengthways</p>

  <p class="ing">2 parsnips, peeled and cut in half lengthways</p>

  <p class="ing">300g/10½oz celeriac (celery root), peeled and cut into large chunks</p>

  <p class="ing">2 fennel bulbs, halved or quartered depending on size</p>

  <p class="ing">2 red onions, peeled, halved or quartered depending on size</p>

  <p class="ing">8 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing">2 sprigs of rosemary</p>

  <p class="ing">2 sprigs of thyme</p>

  <p class="ing2">2 bay leaves</p>

  <p class="step">Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6.</p>

  <p class="step">Put all the vegetables in a large roasting tin, toss with extra virgin olive oil, salt, pepper and the herbs. Cover with foil and place in the hot oven for 1 hour. Remove the foil and put back in the oven for about 20 minutes, until all the vegetables are cooked through.</p>

  <p class="step">Remove from the oven and serve with roasted meat.</p>
