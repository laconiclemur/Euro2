<p class="normal"><b>Pork shoulder, or Boston butt, is a very tasty part of the pig and the small amount of fat it contains brings a lovely flavor to this dish. I think the secret to the success of this recipe, however, lies in the cabbage! I have used a hispi cabbage, also called pointed or sweetheart, which is braised in a delicious combination of chili, ginger and honey that gives it a wonderful balance of flavors.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 10 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 20 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons sunflower oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 Boston butt steaks, about 5 ounces each</p>
<p class="acktxt">5 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 hispi or other young, spring cabbage, quartered lengthwise, stem removed and shredded</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 long red chilies, seeded and finely chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">1½-inch piece gingerroot, peeled and cut into julienne strips</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons honey</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon roughly chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Heat the oven to 275°F. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sunflower oil and the pork steaks and cook 3 to 4 minutes until they are golden brown underneath, then add 2 tablespoons of the butter, turn the pork and cook the other side until golden. Transfer the pork to a plate, cover with aluminum foil and keep warm in the oven. Leave the skillet to one side.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Bring a saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add the cabbage, cover the pan with a lid and return the water to a boil, then drain immediately. Return the cabbage to the pan and add 1½ of the red chilies, the ginger, honey and 2 tablespoons the remaining butter and season with salt and pepper. Cover the pan with a lid, put over very low heat and gently braise the cabbage 2 to 3 minutes until just it is tender. Remove the pan from the heat, cover and leave to one side while you finish making the sauce.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Return the skillet to a high heat. When the juices are bubbling, add ½ cup water and cook 2 minutes, or until it reduces by half. Reduce the heat to medium, add the remaining butter to the pan, a little at a time, whisking to incorporate it into the sauce. Add the remaining chili and half the parsley and stir through. Check the seasoning, adding more salt and pepper to taste. Remove the pork from the oven and pour any resting juices into the sauce, stirring one last time.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Stir the remaining parsley into the cabbage. Scoop the cabbage out of the pan with a slotted spoon into a warm bowl, making sure any residual liquid stays in the pan. Return the pan to a high heat and boil the liquid until it reduces and is slightly syrupy. Add the extra virgin olive oil, season with salt and pepper to taste, then spoon the sauce over the cabbage. Serve the pork with the buttery sauce spooned over the top and with the honey-coated cabbage.</p>
