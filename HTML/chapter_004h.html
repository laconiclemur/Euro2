<h2 class="h2b">CUISSES DE POULET BRAISEES AU VIN ROUGE</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Braised Chicken Legs in Red Wine</em></h3>
<p class="normall"><em>The flavouring here echoes the orange- and herb-scented richness of the daubes. If you prefer, as Susan, our editor, suggested, rather than using the whole legs you can just use a couple of chicken thighs per person. This is easier as you don’t have to butcher the legs. But at the time of the suggestion, we’d already taken the photo which we all really loved so we went with the original plan. Don’t be tempted to use the breasts though; they just dry out instead of cooking to a melting moistness like the legs</em>.</p>
<p class="normalla0"><em>Once again, very slow careful cooking is the secret. Always give yourself plenty more time than the recipe says, as sometimes it will take a little longer. Never panic, the legs will always cook eventually. Cooking dinner once for fourteen or so at Le Baou, they still weren’t ready as I was serving the starter, but they got there, leaving plenty of time for chat and a few extra glasses between courses</em>.</p>
<div class="hang0">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
8 chicken legs, separated into thigh and drumstick<br/>
1 bottle full-bodied red wine<br/>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>
50ml (2fl oz) groundnut oil<br/>
30g (1¼ oz) butter<br/>
8 garlic cloves, peeled<br/>
24 small shallots, peeled<br/>
2 tomatoes, roughly chopped<br/>
2 tbsp plain flour<br/>
30g (1¼ oz) dried ceps<br/>
1 bouquet garni (2 bay leaves, 1 large sprig dried thyme or savory)<br/>
2 strips Dried Orange Zest (<em><a href="chapter_006j.html#page173">see here</a></em>)<br/>
Cornflour (optional)<br/>
Caster sugar</p>
</div>
<div class="hang00">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">TO FINISH (OPTIONAL)</span><br/>
Finely grated zest of 1 orange<br/>
2 large ripe tomatoes, seeded and diced<br/>
12 large black olives, stoned and chopped<br/>
3 large sprigs savory or thyme, leaves picked from the stalks, chopped</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 110°C/225°F/Gas ¼.</p>
<p class="normala">Put the chicken pieces in a dish that just holds them. Reduce the red wine by half over your highest heat. Leave the wine to cool a little, then pour it over the chicken and leave to marinate for half an hour or so, turning occasionally. This done, drain the chicken pieces and pat them dry, keeping the red wine marinade for the sauce.</p>
<p class="normala">Heat the groundnut oil in a large ovenproof saucepan, or do it in a frying pan and then transfer the chicken to a casserole dish. Season the chicken well, then sear and colour for 5 minutes. You need to fry the pieces in a single layer so do it in batches if necessary. Reduce the heat, remove the fat, then add the butter and caramelise the chicken pieces for a further 5 minutes until they are a beautiful dark brown colour.</p>
<p class="normala">Remove the fat from the pan, add the whole garlic cloves and shallots and sweat these for a minute or so. Add the tomato and cook at the highest heat for 2 minutes. Spoon in the flour and stir well, making sure that no lumps form. Add the dried ceps. Pour in the reduced red wine gradually, then just enough water to cover, and add the bouquet garni and orange zest. Bring to the boil and skim, then place into the preheated oven and braise for 2 hours, making absolutely sure that the liquid never boils.</p>
<p class="normala">Check to see if the chicken is tender enough to eat with a spoon, then remove from the oven. Lift out the chicken pieces and reduce the sauce until it is rich in colour and strong in taste. (The chicken will keep in its sauce at this stage for up to three days in the fridge. If you do this, reheat the chicken pieces very gently, stirring as little as possible so they don’t break up when you are going to serve them.)</p>
<p class="normala">If necessary, thicken the sauce with a little cornflour and season with salt, sugar and black pepper. Add the chicken pieces back to the sauce and serve them with fresh pasta and, if you like, a sprinkling of the orange zest, tomatoes, olives and savory.</p>
