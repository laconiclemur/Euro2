			<p class="rec-intro">This can also be made with ordinary pork but it’s particularly good with wild boar. The head needs to be shaved and singed to remove all the bristles, then taken off the bone. If this is beyond your talents the butcher should be able to oblige. </p>

			<p class="body">Take the head, lay it out flat, with the skin-side down, on your work surface and season. Mix the garlic, mustard, rosemary and thyme and spread this evenly over the meat. Then roll the head up neatly and tie tightly with string. Place it in a pan, cover well with cold water and bring it to the boil. Skim well, add the celery, carrot, onion, bay, peppercorns and some salt, then turn down the heat so the water is barely simmering. Cook gently for 2–3 hours, depending on the size of the head, until the meat is tender and until easily pierced with a skewer. </p>
			<p class="body">Leave the meat to cool in the cooking liquid, then take it out and roll it tightly in cling film. Refrigerate overnight. Pass the stock through a sieve and use it for a soup another time. </p>
			<p class="body">For the sauce, simmer the finely chopped shallots in the wine until all the liquid has evaporated. Add the stock and continue to cook until the shallots are soft and the liquid sticky. Season with salt, pepper and a generous amount of cayenne, then leave it to cook a little.</p>
			<p class="body">Make a mayonnaise with the yolks, mustard and vinegar and slowly whisk in the oil. Once made, add the shallot mix and check the seasoning. The sauce should have a good kick and be a little sharp.</p>
			<p class="body">When you’re ready to eat, cut the head into 2cm slices and then remove the string and cling film – they help to keep everything in place as you slice. Heat a tablespoon of vegetable oil and fry the slices until crispy on both sides. Serve with the mayonnaise and some roast vegetables.</p>
