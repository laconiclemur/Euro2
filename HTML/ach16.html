<p class="noindentb">The best mussels to use when preparing this recipe are from Prince Edward Island or New Zealand when they are in season. Leave the mussels in their shells, making for a less formal, hands-on presentation, or remove the mussels from their shells before serving, return them to the pot to warm through, and then ladle them out with the vegetables and broth. Either way, this is a tasty warm appetizer or light luncheon dish. It may also be tossed with cooked short-cut pasta such as penne or ziti.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 clove garlic, cut in half</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> In a flameproof casserole set over medium-high heat, warm 2 tablespoons of the olive oil with the shallots, potatoes, zucchini, sliced garlic, wine, water, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring a few times, until the potatoes have softened, about 6 minutes. Place the mussels on top of the vegetables and sprinkle the tomatoes on top of the mussels. Cover and cook until the mussel shells have opened, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and discard any unopened mussels.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_31"/><span class="red">2.</span> Remove the vegetables with a slotted spoon and distribute them evenly among six plates or shallow soup bowls. Top with equal portions of mussels. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and the parsley to the liquid remaining in the casserole. Set the casserole over high heat and whisk the broth to combine the ingredients, adding more water if necessary. Cook just to warm through, about 1 minute, and pour on top of the mussels. Serve immediately, accompanied by toasted bread rubbed with the garlic halves.</p>
