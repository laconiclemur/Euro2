<p class="yield">MAKES 2 COCAS. ABOUT 14 BY 6 INCHES/36 BY 15 CM EACH</p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Cocas are flat, oval breads that can be savory, prepared either alone or as a base for topping like a rustic pizza</span> <a href="49-chapter28.html#page_70"><span class="red">(see page 70)</span></a><span class="red">. But frequently they are sweet. In Mallorca, bakers prepare a version with candied dried fruit for San Juan on June 23 and 24, while on the mainland, you find <em>coca de llardons</em> (or <em>chicharrones</em>) topped with sugar, pine nuts, and fried pork rinds (with some fat), an interesting combination of flavors and textures.</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">     This sugar-topped favorite version of the recipe also goes by the Catalan name <em>coca de forner</em>. (<em>Forner</em> means “baker,” from <em>forn</em>, “oven.”) The dough is savory—the sweetness comes from sprinkling the top with sugar before baking. Watch that the pine nuts don’t blacken during baking.</span></strong></p>

<li>4 CUPS/510 G ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR, PLUS MORE FOR WORK SURFACE</li>
<li>2 TEASPOONS SALT</li>
<li>1 TABLESPOON FIRMLY PACKED FRESH BAKER’S YEAST <a href="58-chapter37.html#page_86">(SEE NOTE, PAGE 86)</a> OR 2 TEASPOONS ACTIVE DRY YEAST</li>
<li>¼ CUP/60 ML EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL, PLUS MORE FOR OILING BOWL AND BRUSHING DOUGH</li>

</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt, crumble in the yeast, add the olive oil, and begin working in about 1½&gt; cups/360 ml warm water until it forms a moist, sticky ball. Let sit for 5 minutes. Transfer to a lightly floured work surface and knead by hand for about 10 minutes, until the dough is supple and elastic and still slightly sticky. Or use a mechanical bread hook.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> Place the dough in a large, lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rest at warm room temperature for 1½&gt; hours, or until it has doubled in size.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Transfer the dough to a work space and divide in half. Form by hand into oblong rolls and transfer to the sheets.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Preheat the oven to 425°F/220°C/gas mark 7.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">6.</span> Gently stretch and press out the dough with your fingertips into ovals just over ½&gt; inch/1.25 cm thick, about 14 inches/36 cm long, and 5 or 6 inches/13 or 15 cm wide. Generously brush with olive oil, cover with plastic wrap, and let sit for 15 minutes to rise again.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">7.</span> Sprinkle over the pine nuts and then very generously sprinkle the cocas with sugar. Shake some drops of anisette over the top. Bake until lightly golden and rich brown in places, 20 to 25 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through baking. Cool on wire racks before serving.</p>
