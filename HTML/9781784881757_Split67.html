<h1 class="chapter">rabbit casserole</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>Our friends Clare and Mirko live in rural Tuscany and learnt this recipe from their neighbour. Rabbits are either farmed or shot in the wild. Giancarlo tells me they are always sold with the head on so that you know you are not buying a cat, as was once the way in poorer days. As rabbit usually comes with the liver in Italy, this is either added to the dish or dusted in flour, fried briefly and given to children. You can also add the liver to a meat ragù (see <a href="9781784881757_Split100.html#page_171">memmo’s beef ragù</a>). The recipe works equally well with chicken.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 6 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 large red onion, peeled and roughly chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1.6 kg (2 lb 5 oz) rabbit (1 medium rabbit), jointed into 12 pieces</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1½ teaspoons salt</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 rabbit liver (optional)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>200 ml (7 fl oz/generous ¾ cup) dry white wine</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 heaped tablespoons tomato purée (paste)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>400 ml (13 fl oz/1¾ cups) <a href="9781784881757_Split15.html#page_32">Chicken</a> or <a href="9781784881757_Split19.html#page_35a">Vegetable Stock</a>, or water</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>80 g (3 oz) black olives (stones in)</b></p>
<p class="tx3"><b>TO SERVE</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>Swiss chard or spinach (see <a href="9781784881757_Split21.html#page_38">cooking greens</a>)</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Heat the oil in a large, wide casserole or heavy-based pan over a low heat. Add the onion and cook for about 10 minutes until soft. Add the rabbit and season them with the salt and a few good twists of pepper. Cook over a low-medium heat for about 20 minutes, turning the meat occasionally, until the pieces of meat are golden all over. Keep an eye on the pan as you don’t want the onions to burn. Roughly chop the liver and add it to the pan, if you have it, followed by the wine, and leave to simmer gently for about 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="tx">Stir the tomato purée into the stock or water, then pour it into the pan. Continue to cook for about 40 minutes, or until the meat is soft and falling from the bones. At the last moment, add the olives.</p>
<p class="tx">Remove from the heat and serve with Swiss chard or spinach drizzled with your best olive oil and some lemon juice.</p>
