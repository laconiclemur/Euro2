<p class="pf">My parents had no honeymoon, but according to country tradition, Ted’s brothers tied cowbells to the springs of the bed—quite a bit different from the usual painted and decorated getaway car that Dick and I would later have at our wedding.</p>
<p>I was conceived and born in the same bed, and in the same house my father, Isä, had been born in twenty-five years earlier. I was born on July 22, 1934. As I like to say, on the day I was born, my life changed. For some unknown reason, my father insisted on naming me “Beatrice,” which was an unusual name for a Finn to choose. After all, the Finns don’t even use the letter <i>b</i>
 in their language. The letter <i>b</i>
 is pronounced somewhere between a <i>b</i>
 and a <i>p.</i>
</p>
<p>You might ask, “What difference does that little fact make?”</p>
<p>When my grandfather came to visit—the same day I was born—he asked, “What is the baby’s name?”</p>
<p>My mother replied, “Beatrice.”</p>
<p>“<i>Peetsis</i>
? That’s no human name, that’s a fruit!” he said in Finnish.</p>
<p>The name stuck. From that day on, my name was “Peachie” or “Peaches.”</p>
<p>I was known to Finns as “Pikku Peetsi” or “Little Peachie.”</p>
<p>This name “problem” could have been solved if I’d followed my mother’s advice the day I started first grade in Floodwood. As I took off for school in the big yellow bus, Mummy told me, “Now remember that your name is Beatrice. You don’t want to be stuck with a nickname all your life!”</p>
<p>I settled in to my classroom with thirty-four classmates. Miss Pappanen named all of the students in the class. Then she said, “Hmm, we have two Beatrices—how are we going to tell them apart?”</p>
<p>I waved my hand enthusiastically, “I know, I know! You can call me Peaches!” So, Peaches it was from that point on in my life. Even my elementary school report card named me as “Peaches Luoma.” It just seemed so very normal.</p>
<p>The other Beatrice and I bonded immediately. She later became known as “Bea,” but I remained Peaches or Peachie.</p>
<p>To this day I have trouble introducing myself as Bea. It is like stealing my best friend’s name.</p>

<p class="psec">My mother said I was a hungry baby. There was always homemade rye bread in the house and when I was just a few months old, she would leave a slice of buttered bread next to my crib. When I woke at night, I’d find it, sit up, and eat every last crumb; then I’d crawl back under the covers, satisfied. A friend once told Mummy that she was “spoiling” me and that no child had to be fed in the middle of the night. My mother didn’t have the heart to break me of the habit of midnight eating with no warning, so she decided to wean me off it. One night she put a crust of dry, unbuttered, hard bread next to my crib, thinking I’d reject it. When I woke for my usual snack, I took that crust and gnawed and chewed away at it until it was finished. Then I went back to sleep. This made her sad. She continued with the slice of buttered bread. I don’t remember how long. To this day when I’m hungry, all it takes is a slice of whole grain Finnish rye bread to satisfy me.</p>
<p>The Finnish rye bread that was a staple in our house is a simple bread, made with milk or water, coarse rye flour, white bread flour, a little salt, a little sugar, and yeast. My mother made it in large batches, once or twice a week, depending on how many extra mouths there would be at the table. If somebody showed up at the doorstep around mealtime, they were always invited to sit down and share a meal. Usually the menu consisted of Finnish rye bread (you’ll find that recipe later in the book) and a strange-sounding stew called “mojakka” that is really a hearty beef (or in our case, venison) stew with potatoes, onions, and rutabagas. The stew is simmered over low heat until the meat and vegetables are “falling apart” tender. Nobody really knows where the name comes from. It isn’t known in Finland, nor does it appear in any dictionary. Mojakka can be made with a meat base, or it can be made with fish. It got so that whenever we had leftover meat on hand, we would turn it into mojakka.</p>

</p>
<p class="rpf">This stew (pronounced moy-yah-kah) is known only to American Finns, largely in the Upper Midwest, and can be made with any kind of meat. We most often made it with venison. The vegetables vary, but we always used root vegetables—whatever we had on hand.</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpilf">3 pounds boneless beef or venison cubes, or leftover roast, trimmed and cut up</p>
<p class="rpil">2 tablespoons butter, lard, or oil</p>
<p class="rpil">4½ to 5 cups water</p>
<p class="rpil">1 onion, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="rpil">2 teaspoons salt</p>
<p class="rpil">½ teaspoon ground black pepper</p>
<p class="rpil">½ teaspoon whole allspice (optional)</p>
<p class="rpil">2 cups chopped carrots, rutabaga, turnips, parsnips, or other root vegetables</p>
<p class="rpil">4 potatoes, peeled and cubed</p>
<p class="rpill">2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">In a large pot over medium high heat, brown the meat on all sides in the butter. (If using leftover roast, you can skip this step.) Add 4 cups of the water and bring to a boil. Add the onion, salt, ground black pepper, and optional allspice. Reduce heat to low and simmer for one hour or until the meat is “falling apart” tender.</p>
<p class="rp">Add the carrots and/or other root vegetables and potatoes and simmer for another 1½ hours. Mix the flour and remaining ½ cup water in a separate small bowl, forming a thin paste. Add this to the soup, stirring well and simmer for 15 more minutes.</p>
<p class="rpy">Makes 8–10 servings</p>
