<span class="big">T</span>
he fact that Spain, with its extensive Atlantic, Biscay and Mediterranean coastlines consumes more fish per capita than any other nation in Europe is not particularly surprising. What is astonishing is that Europe’s largest wholesale fish market should be found in Madrid, over 300 km from the coast.</p>
<p class="indent">The <em>Madrileños</em>
 are obsessed with their fish and so, every dawn scores of white vans hurtle inland with their catch. The biggest, the freshest, the most highly sought after; it all invariably ends up in the capital to be snapped up by restaurant chefs and a few upmarket fishmongers. Ernesto Prieto’s legendary stand in the smart Mercado Chamartín is a showcase of the nation’s most highly prized and, quite possibly, most highly priced fish and shellfish. Chefs, gastronomes and well-heeled housewives can be sure of exceptional quality as they patiently wait their turn. Turbot, sea bass, hake and monkfish, the selection is outstanding and there are the choicest cuts too. Here you can find elusive <em>kokotxas</em>
, little morsels of gelatinous flesh from the hake’s throat, worshipped in the Basque country or the <em>ventresca de atún</em>
, the tuna’s most succulent meat, from the belly.</p>
<p class="indent">Meanwhile, on the Mediterranean coast near Tarragona fishermen’s wives set up their trestle tables on the dockside. The commercial fish auction takes place in the nearby <em>lonja</em>
, or wholesale market, but these ladies are selling off the scraps. On offer is a motley-looking selection of tiny rockfish, scarlet scorpion fish and other bony specimens. Locals snap them up to make the deliciously rich stock that flavours traditional rice dishes such as <em>arròs a banda</em>
 or <em>paella</em>
. In the right hands, these are every bit as good as a prime hake steak, at a fraction of the price.</p>
<p class="indent">Coastal markets such as Galicia’s Pontevedra or Barcelona’s Boquería are the jewels in the crown when it comes to seasonal, local fish. Spotted rays, monkfish, red mullet, huge grouper, or the majestic gilt-head sea bream; there will always be something to take your fancy. Smaller markets have their magic too. In Málaga an old guy sat on an orange box painstakingly filleting tiny fresh anchovies, ready for frying or pickling in vinegar. Land bound Trujillo, in the depths of Extremadura, was hardly a promising prospect and yet I came across a local passion for tench, and a very tasty fish it proved to be. And then there was my <em>Sevillano</em>
 pin-up, a muscle-bound fishmonger who had found a new vocation as he delighted tourists lifting a 22 kg <em>corvina</em>
, or meagre, with the ease of a champion weightlifter. He seemed so taken with his celebrity status that, an hour later, despite a steady stream of visitors, flashes were still firing and he hadn’t shifted as much as a sardine.</p>
<p class="indent">Less familiar to the visitor are the stalls of salted fish that are such a feature of the Spanish market. Salting was once a means of preserving cod for long sea voyages or for the Catholic consumer inland, who needed his Friday fish. Today salt cod, or <em>bacalao</em>
, is hailed as the ‘ham of the sea’ and features on upmarket menus from the Basque coast to the inland plains of Castille. The cured anchovies of Cantabria and the Costa Brava are given cult status too, nibbled alongside a glass of local wine. Further south <em>mojama</em>
, or salted tuna, and <em>botargo</em>
, or the pressed grey mullet roe, are the stars of the show. Wafer-thin slices, along with a dash of extra virgin olive oil, make a simple and delicious starter.</p>

suquet de peix</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_3">catalan fish hotpot</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Here is one of the most celebrated dishes of the Costa Brava; a hotpot of the freshest fish cooked with the mixture of onions and tomatoes known as a <em>sofregit</em>
. The <em>sofregit</em>
 is one of the keystones of Catalan cooking and the real secret to success is to fry the onions and tomatoes slowly until you have a rich, brick-coloured paste.</p>
<p class="indent">The stew is finished with a <em>picada</em>
, another Catalan classic consisting of a ground mixture of herbs, garlic, nuts and bread that miraculously thickens, enriches and seasons the dish in one go.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 6</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 tbsp olive oil</strong>

<em>Allioli</em>
</strong>
 (see page 114)</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Begin by heating half the olive oil in a pan and frying the garlic cloves until they turn golden. Remove and set aside for the <em>picada</em>
. Next add the slice of bread to the pan and fry until it is browned on both sides. Set aside with the garlic.</p>
<p class="extract">Mix the flour and ½ tsp salt together on a plate, dredge the fish steaks in the mixture, shaking off any excess flour, then fry the fish in the garlic oil. You may need to add a couple of tablespoons of extra oil to the pan. Once the fish is golden on both sides pour on the brandy and ignite or, if you are afraid of losing your eyebrows, cook over a high heat until the pan is almost dry. Remove the fish from the pan and set aside.</p>
<p class="extract">Now it is time to make the <em>sofregit</em>
. In the same pan, adding a touch more oil if necessary, fry the onions until really soft and beginning to caramelize. Add the grated tomato flesh and continue to cook until you have a thick paste. Add the potatoes, fish stock and bay leaf and cook for about 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p class="extract">Meanwhile, make the <em>picada</em>
 by grinding together the reserved garlic and bread with the roasted almonds and parsley until you have a smooth paste. Energetic purists will stick to the traditional mortar and pestle for this, while I happily resort to the food processor!</p>
<p class="extract">Add the <em>picada</em>
 to the pan together with the fish and simmer for about 5 minutes until the fish is just cooked through, a little longer if you are using monkfish.</p>
<p class="extract">Serve with good bread and a generous dollop of <em>Allioli</em>
.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Making a simple fish stock</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent5">
<span class="gray">Many seafood dishes are cooked with fish stock, the quality of which will determine the success of the final dish. It amazes me how many people will splash out on an expensive fish only to cook it with a stock cube.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">Making tasty stock is very easy if you remember a few basic points. Do not use oily fish for stocks. Wash the fish bones and heads carefully to remove any blood that could taint the flavour of the stock. Add the bones, heads and skin to just enough cold water to cover, together with a halved onion, a chopped carrot and a stick of celery. You may like to add a bay leaf, parsley stalks and a few peppercorns too. Simmer for 20 minutes and strain, any longer and the stock may taste bitter. Do not let the stock boil.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">It’s hardly ‘rocket science’ and your friendly fishmonger will often be happy to part with a few extra bones for nothing.</span>

dorada al horno</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_5">baked gilt-head bream</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Shoals of exotic, glistening seafood piled on ice are a glorious sight, but when it comes to the crunch a huge array of unfamiliar fish can be a daunting prospect for any but the most experienced chef. It is all too easy to plump for the more familiar, bone-free, portion-sized piece of tuna or salmon. Yet roasting a whole fish in the oven is one of the simplest and tastiest things to do with a deliciously fresh fish.</p>
<p class="indent">On Spain’s Mediterranean coast the <em>dorada</em>
, or gilt-head bream, would be the top contender for such a treatment. With its painted golden brow and cheeks it is the king of the sea bream family, a title earned not just for its good looks, but for texture and flavour too. The <em>dorada</em>
’s slightly less distinguished cousin the <em>pargo</em>
, or common or red sea bream, would be equally fit for the job too.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 large potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 tbsp olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 onion, sliced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 x 675 g/1½ lb sea bream, scaled and gutted (cleaned)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 bay leaves</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 lemon, cut into wedges</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 small bunch of fresh parsley, chopped</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 garlic cloves, crushed</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>100 ml/3 fl oz wine</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/Gas Mark 6.</p>
<p class="extract">Select a roasting tin large enough to hold your fish and arrange the potatoes over the base. Sprinkle over the olive oil and toss the potato slices around with your fingers ensuring that they are covered in the oil. Roast for 10 minutes. Do not be tempted to add any salt at this point; it will draw moisture out of the potatoes preventing them from browning.</p>
<p class="extract">Next add the onion and carefully stir into the potatoes turning them as you go. Return the tin to the oven and roast for a further 10 minutes until the potatoes and onions begin to gild.</p>
<p class="extract">Meanwhile, rinse the fish, removing any traces of blood, stubborn scales, fins and gills. It is an idea to leave the dorsal fin (the fin on its back) intact, to help check whether the fish is thoroughly cooked later on. Now make 2–3 diagonal slashes into the flesh on each side of the fish and season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="extract">Arrange the fish on top of the potatoes, inserting a bay leaf and a lemon wedge into each and squeezing the remaining lemon juice over the top of the fish. Sprinkle over the parsley, garlic and wine and roast for 15–20 minutes until the fish is cooked (see right). Serve at once.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Variations</strong>
 You could stuff the fish with a <em>picadillo</em>
, or finely chopped mixture, of fresh tomato, basil and green olives. I would love to serve this dish with some simply roasted red peppers (see page 144).</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Is it cooked?</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">When baking a whole fish the dorsal fin will pull away easily once the flesh is cooked. The flakes of the fish become more distinguishable once cooked. They will flake apart when you press the flesh and the shiny translucent flesh will have also become opaque.</p>

merluza en salsa verde</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_7">hake with parsley sauce</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Hake, with its dense yet soft white flesh is possibly the country’s favourite fish. Crate upon crate of these ugly, eel-like fish are landed every dawn on the wharf at Vigo’s wholesale fish market. Much of the hake is caught by British boats but sold in Spain where it commands higher prices.</p>
<p class="indent">This is a classic recipe from the Northern Spanish kitchen. Each and every chef seems to have his own rendition of ‘the’ truly authentic recipe. Here you have it in its simplest form. However, you may like to add any of the following to the sauce: peas, asparagus tips, prawns, steamed clams, poached or boiled eggs.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp plain flour</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>salt</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 x 175–200 g/6–7 oz hake fillets</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 tbsp olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 tbsp dry white wine</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp water or fish stock</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>Juice of ½ lemon (optional)</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Mix the flour and a pinch of salt together on a plate, then dredge the fish steaks in the mixture, shaking off any excess flour.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan, add the garlic and fry until golden. Remove the garlic and set aside.</p>
<p class="extract">Add the fish skin-side up to the pan and fry for a few minutes, shaking the pan regularly. This not only ensures that the hake does not stick, it also helps to begin thickening the oil to a sauce-like consistency. Turn the fish over very carefully with a spatula or fish slice and continue to fry for a couple more minutes, shaking the pan as you go.</p>
<p class="extract">Add the wine together with the water or fish stock and simmer until the fish is just cooked through (see page 35). Add the reserved garlic and half of the parsley to the sauce. Taste to check the seasoning, adding salt or lemon juice if necessary.</p>
<p class="extract">Sprinkle the fish with the remaining parsley and serve right away with simple, boiled potatoes.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Buying fish</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent5">
<span class="gray">Fresh fish should be eaten as soon as possible after being caught. A strong ‘fishy’ aroma is a sure sign of stale fish; fresh fish should smell almost sweet.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">The perfect fish should have bright, shining eyes and deep red gills, these go pale as the fish deteriorates. The flesh of fresh fish will feel firm to the touch and the skin will look glossy. Perhaps the best advice is to get to know your fishmonger and you will benefit from his expert knowledge.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">Domestic refrigerators are not really cold enough to store fish for any length of time – if you are not using on the day of purchase, then store on ice on the bottom shelf. Fish does not freeze particularly well, it tends to dry out, unless you can buy it vacuum-packed.</span>
</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Preparing fish</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent5">
<span class="gray">Recipes should be simple, with clean flavours that do not mask the subtle taste of the fish. Take care not to overcook fish, remember that it will continue to cook a little after it has been removed from the heat. Serve fish immediately after cooking.</span>

atun adobado</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_9">marinated tuna</h1>
<p class="nonindent">The warm waters around the Canary Islands are home to the <em>rabil</em>
, or yellowfin tuna. This fish is prized for its firm, pale pink flesh, but can easily dry out during cooking if you’re not careful. Hence this aromatic marinade which guarantees a gloriously juicy texture as well as a wonderful flavour. This recipe will also work well with any fresh tuna.</p>
<p class="indent">You will need to begin this dish 24 hours in advance.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 x 175–225 g/6–8 oz tuna steaks</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">

<strong>1–2 chillies, according to your taste, very finely chopped</strong>

</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 tbsp white wine</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Mix all the marinade ingredients together in a bowl.</p>
<p class="extract">Place the fish in a large non-reactive bowl or tray, pour over the marinade and turn the fish until coated. I sometimes use a zip-lock bag so that I can remove all the air and make sure the fish is completely covered in the marinade. Refrigerate for 24 hours.</p>
<p class="extract">Remove the fish from the refrigerator a few minutes before cooking, allowing it to reach room temperature.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat the olive oil in a frying pan over a high heat, add the tuna, reserving the marinade, and cook for a couple of minutes on each side, a little longer if you do not like eating rare fish.</p>
<p class="extract">Place the fish on a hot serving plate while you add the marinade to the pan. Leave this to bubble for a minute or two before pouring over the tuna. Serve at once.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Buying tips</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent5">
<span class="gray">The surface of the tuna flesh should never look dry or have a rainbow-like sheen. The belly, <em>ventresca</em>
, is the most highly prized cut because of the high fat content. The flesh bastes itself as it cooks, remaining fabulously succulent. Tuna can range from deep, steak red to pale pink in colour depending on the species.</span>
</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Know your tuna</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent5">
<span class="gray">
<em>Atún rojo</em>
, or bluefin tuna, is deep red in colour, has very dense firm flesh and a strong flavour. This is the most readily available tuna available in Spain.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">
<em>Bonito</em>
 is a smaller fish, not a true tuna, but similar in taste, popular in the North with dark flesh. It is quite similar to the bluefin and prepared in similar ways.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">
<em>Albacora</em>
, <em>atún blanco</em>
, <em>bonito del norte</em>
, or albacore, is much paler in colour and more subtle in flavour. <em>Bonito del norte</em>
 is the king of all tuna as far as the Northern Spanish are concerned. You will find it canned too, at a price!</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">
<em>Rabil</em>
, or yellowfin tuna, has paler, pink flesh, a mild flavour and somewhat drier texture, so take care not to overcook it. This fish is popular eating in the Canary Islands.</span>
</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Cooking tuna</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent5">
<span class="gray">Tuna has little fat and very meaty flesh. It is best cooked quickly to retain moisture – on the barbecue, under the grill or in the hot pan.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">As rare as you dare is my advice, overcooked tuna has the texture of cardboard.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">Remove the tuna from the refrigerator a few minutes before cooking, allowing it to reach room temperature. Otherwise your rare centre may remain unappetizingly cold.</span>

sardinas rebozadas</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_11">sardine fritters</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Stacks of wooden crates packed with glistening sardines hail the summertime in markets all around the Spanish coast. Sardines are astonishingly cheap compared with often prohibitively expensive white-fleshed fish such as sea bass or monkfish. Yet, there is no doubt that a stunningly fresh sardine, grilled directly over the barbecue coals, accompanied with nothing but rock salt and extra virgin olive oil, then gnawed somewhat unceremoniously in the fingers, is hard to beat. Equally delicious is this simple recipe gleaned from the fishermen in L’Ametlle del Mar, a busy port on the edge of the Ebro Delta.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>8 x 110 g/4 oz sardines, scaled and filleted</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tsp salt</strong>

<p class="ingreds">
<strong>100 g/4 oz plain flour</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 lemons, cut into wedges</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Season the sardine fillets with the salt, pepper, cumin and parsley.</p>
<p class="extract">Next pour the olive oil into a large frying pan, to a depth of about 1 cm/½ inch and place over a high heat.</p>
<p class="extract">Meanwhile, set up your production line: a small bowl for the beaten eggs and a dinner plate for the flour. Dip the fish into the egg mixture, then turn in the flour.</p>
<p class="extract">Once the oil is really hot, begin to fry the fish fillets a few at a time until the batter becomes golden and the flesh is firm. This will take a matter of moments.</p>
<p class="extract">Drain the fish on kitchen paper and place in an oven to keep warm while you fry the remaining fillets.</p>
<p class="extract">Serve at once with wedges of lemon.</p>

truchas al horno</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_13">baked trout</h1>
<p class="nonindent">The town of Trevélez sits high in the Sierra Nevada. It is well known for its delicious trout, fished from the crystal clear waters of the river, but its true claim to fame is the curing of excellent quality <em>jamón Serrano</em>
. The cool dry mountain air is ideal for the process and raw hams are brought here from all over Spain. The entire town is pervaded by the wafts of ham.</p>
<p class="indent">My visit was most untimely, five months pregnant and cured meat among the dreaded list of forbidden fruits; it was torture. Thankfully I could eat this dish since the ham is crisped in the oven. The combination of trout and <em>jamón</em>
 is a classic all over Spain. The saltiness of the ham cuts beautifully through the richness of the oily fish.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 tbsp olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 garlic cloves, finely diced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped</strong>

<p class="extract">Line a baking sheet or roasting tin with foil and oil with 1 tbsp olive oil.</p>
<p class="extract">Mix the garlic, herbs, a pinch of salt, pepper and 2 tbsp olive oil together in a bowl. Now spoon this aromatic paste into the body cavity of each fish.</p>
<p class="extract">Brush the outside of the trout with the remaining oil, then give each fish a waistcoat of ham, tucking the outside edges of the ham into the bellies. Bake in the oven for 15–20 minutes until the eyes are glazed, the flesh feels firm and the ham has crisped up. (See tips for baking whole fish, page 35.) Serve at once.</p>

<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_15">salt cod croquettes</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Should cooking salt cod, or <em>bacalao</em>
, seem a little daunting then here is a good place to start. A small amount of fish goes a long way and you will have a chance to experience how simple the soaking process is (see page 44).</p>
<p class="indent">Potato, rather than the more customary béchamel (see Partridge <em>Croquetas</em>
 on page 81), binds these melt-in-the-mouth salt cod croquettes giving them a wonderful texture. If the idea of deep-frying fills you with horror then you could shape these as flat discs and shallow-fry them instead, but then, of course, you will be making fishcakes and not <em>croquetas</em>
 at all. You will need to begin preparing your salt cod 24 hours in advance.</p>
<p class="aserves">makes 12 croquetas</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>200 g/7 oz salt cod (dry weight), de-salted (see page 44)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 bay leaf</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 large floury potatoes, about 300 g/ 11 oz, washed and unpeeled</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 garlic cloves, crushed</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 tbsp plain flour</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>vegetable oil, for frying</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<span class="gray"><br/>
</span>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<span class="gray">to serve</span>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>lemon wedges</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>mayonnaise (see page 114) or <em>Allioli</em>
 (see page 114)</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Place the salt cod in a saucepan with the bay leaf and cover with cold water. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and cook for 3–4 minutes.</p>
<p class="extract">Remove the fish and place the potatoes in the same water, topping it up if necessary. Boil the potatoes until they are soft.</p>
<p class="extract">Meanwhile, skin and bone the fish, rubbing the flesh through your fingers ensuring that you have a completely bone-free purée. Here is a moment when you can use that miraculous piece of equipment, the <em>pasapurés</em>
 (see page 17).</p>
<p class="extract">Once the potatoes are cooked, drain and peel off the skins. Push the potatoes through a sieve or better still use the <em>pasapurés</em>
 again. This is not the time for lumpy mash.</p>
<p class="extract">Mix the fish, potato, parsley and garlic together in a bowl. Check the seasoning, it is unlikely that you will need any salt, but maybe a little black pepper would go down well.</p>
<p class="extract">Leave the mixture until cold, then, with wet hands, shape into small balls or cylinders. Put the flour on a large plate and roll the <em>croquetas</em>
 in the flour until coated. Set them aside until ready to cook. They can be made a day ahead of time, just cover well or your entire refrigerator will smell fishy.</p>
<p class="extract">When ready to cook, heat enough vegetable oil for frying in a deep pan (see tips on deep-frying page 81) until a bread cube sizzles and browns in 30 seconds. Deep-fry the <em>croquetas</em>
 in 2 batches until a deep golden brown colour.</p>
<p class="extract">Leave to drain on kitchen paper and serve immediately with lemon wedges and mayonnaise or <em>Allioli</em>

ensalada de bacalao y naranja</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_17">salt cod, orange and black olive salad</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Salt cod, or <em>bacalao</em>
, is immensely popular in Spain, a hangover from the days before refrigeration when salting was one of the only means of preservation. Once soaked, the rather unappealing grey, pungent flesh is transformed beyond belief, so do not be put off.</p>
<p class="indent">Today <em>bacalao</em>
 graces the menus of top restaurants and commands ever increasing prices; a trend set to continue with diminishing cod stocks. And why bother eating cotton wool tomatoes and tasteless lettuces in mid-winter? Just a glance in the market will reveal that it is the time for oranges, curly endive and new season olives. This is a truly seasonal salad. You will need to begin preparing your salt cod 24 hours in advance.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>300 g/10 oz salt cod (dry weight), de-salted (see right)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 large Valencia oranges</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 medium potatoes, peeled, boiled and left to go cold</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 handfuls of curly endive, washed and ripped into small pieces</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>½ sweet red onion, very finely sliced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>12 black olives</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<span class="gray"><br/>
</span>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<span class="gray">for the dressing</span>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4–5 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Remove the cod from the soaking water and dry off with kitchen paper. Next, rip the cod into thin strips, removing any bones or skin as you go.</p>
<p class="extract">Peel and slice the oranges into rounds, reserving any spare juice for the dressing. Slice the cold potatoes into small chunks or slices. Place all the salad ingredients together in a large bowl, reserving a few orange slices and olives for garnishing.</p>
<p class="extract">Now you can make the dressing, by mixing the reserved orange juice, the extra virgin olive oil and seasoning together in a bowl. This dressing is really a case of tasting as you go and the result should be quite sweet to counterbalance the salty cod.</p>
<p class="extract">Just prior to serving, toss the salad in the dressing and arrange the reserved orange slices and olives on top.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Variations&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
For a more exotic version, cherries can be substituted for the olives.</p>
<p class="extract">If salt cod is not your scene try this recipe replacing the fish with a large handful of roasted almonds and a couple of boiled eggs for a substantial vegetarian winter salad.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Buying salt cod</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">The dry flesh should have a slightly grey rather than yellowish tone. 150–175g/5–6 oz dry salt cod will yield a good main course serving once soaked.</p>
<p class="indent2">It is best to use loin, or <em>morro</em>
, for main course dishes while the flatter, more economical belly, or <em>loncha</em>
, is ideal for stripping into ribbons for salads.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Preparing salt cod</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent5">
<span class="gray">The cod should be soaked for anything between 24 and 48 hours depending on the size of the pieces, 24 hours will suffice for a thin piece of belly while 36 hours is usually about right for main course portions.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">Place the cod in a large bowl of cold fresh water and refrigerate. You will need to change the water at 8–12 hourly intervals. It is an idea to taste the fish; a hint of saltiness is delicious.</span>
