<p class="normal"><b>This recipe needs a bit of care, but I think you will love the result. Just follow the instructions and you’ll soon get the technique right. The recipe contains wild mushrooms and I normally use a summer truffle, but they might be difficult to find and are very expensive, so look out for the trompette, or horn-of-plenty mushroom, as it’s also called, which you can buy dehydrated.</b></p>

<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 30 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">a little oil, for greasing</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 cups Vegetable Stock (see <a href="010_9781848991583_Recipe4.html">page 17</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">8 baby leeks</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 pounds 5 ounces Idaho potatoes, peeled and cut into 12 pieces</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ ounce dried horn of plenty mushrooms, crumbled</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 leaves gelatin, about ⅛ ounce total weight, soaked in cold water</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 to 5 drops truffle oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ to ¾ cup French Dressing (see <a href="012_9781848991583_Recipe6.html">page 18</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Lightly oil a terrine mold or 12- x 5- x 3½-inch bread pan, then line with three large sheets of plastic wrap, allowing a long overhang on all sides. Wrap two 2-pound bags of sugar in two layers of plastic wrap, then leave the pan and sugar to one side</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Bring the stock to a boil in a wide skillet over high heat. Add the leeks, then turn the heat down to low and simmer 4 to 5 minutes until they are just tender. Lift the leeks out of the stock using a slotted spoon, and drain on paper towels. Cut in half lengthwise and leave to dry.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Add the potatoes to the stock a few at a time, then return the stock to a boil and simmer 10 to 12 minutes until the potatoes are almost tender; the tip of a knife should just go through with the barest resistance. Lift the potatoes onto paper towels to dry. Simmer the stock until it reduces by half.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Put 3 or 4 pieces of potato directly into the bottom of the terrine, making sure the bottom is completely covered. Cover the potatoes with half of the prepared leeks, cut-side down, then sprinkle half of the dried mushrooms over. Repeat with a layer of potatoes, the rest of the leeks, the mushrooms, then a final layer of potatoes.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> By now the stock should have reduced to about 2 cups. Squeeze out the soaked gelatin and add to the hot stock, whisking until it melts. Season with salt and pepper, then strain through a fine strainer over the terrine so the liquid just covers the potatoes; you don’t want it to come up too high up. As you pour, press down lightly on the potatoes so there are not any air pockets. Fold the plastic wrap over the top to cover completely, then put the prepared bags of sugar along the length of the terrine. Leave to cool, then chill in the refrigerator 24 hours until totally set.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>6</b> Turn out the terrine in its plastic-wrap wrapping onto a small tray. Carefully cut into thick slices with a sharp, non-serrated knife, and only then remove and discard the plastic wrap. Add the truffle oil to the French dressing (remember, you only want a few drops of truffle oil, because it is very strong), then stir in the parsley and drizzle over the terrine to serve.</p>
