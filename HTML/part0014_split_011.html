  <p class="chap-para">Torrone is a nougat traditionally enjoyed at Christmas time in Italy; probably the most famous Italian torrone comes from Cremona in northern Italy, where legend has it that it was first made for an important wedding in the fifteenth century. Although torrone is normally bought from shops, you can make it at home. This recipe is a labour of love. Be prepared to spend a couple of hours stirring – ideally get someone to help you. You can flavour the torrone any way you wish – add candied fruit, orange zest, vanilla, cinnamon or coat it with melted chocolate. Slice in chunks, wrap in pretty tissue paper and ribbon and you have a lovely present.</p>

  <p class="ing">Makes 500g/1lb 2oz</p>

  <p class="ing1">30g/1oz/3 tbsp shelled pistachio nuts</p>

  <p class="ing1">200g/7oz/1⅓ cups whole almonds, skinned</p>

  <p class="ing1">100g/3½oz/¾ cup whole hazelnuts, skinned</p>

  <p class="ing1">a sheet of rice paper</p>

  <p class="ing1">a little walnut oil, to grease 150g/5½oz/</p>

  <p class="ing1">scant ½ cup runny honey</p>

  <p class="ing1">150g/5½oz/¾ cup caster (superfine) sugar</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 egg whites</p>

  <p class="ing2">grated zest of 1 lemon (reserve the lemon)</p>

  <p class="para">First toast all the nuts (see tip). You will need a small loaf tin, about 19 x 8cm/7½ x 3¼ inches. Cut a piece of rice paper the same size as the bottom of the tin and another piece slightly larger and set aside. Lightly grease the sides of the tin with walnut oil and turn upside down so the oil doesn’t run on the bottom of the tin.</p>

  <p class="para">Put the honey in a saucepan and cook over another pan of gently simmering water (or use a double-boiler), stirring all the time with a wooden spoon for 1½ hours.</p>

  <p class="para">About 20 minutes before the end of this time, put the sugar and 3 tablespoons water in a small saucepan on a low heat for 15–20 minutes, stirring until the sugar has dissolved and is syrupy. In a clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff. Gradually fold the egg whites into the honey, still cooking over simmering water, and stir well for 5 minutes. Gradually stir in the syrup. Continue to stir for 30 minutes.</p>

  <p class="para">Stir the nuts and lemon zest into the honey mixture. Line the loaf tin with the smaller piece of rice paper and pour in the honey mixture, pressing well with a wet spatula, then press well again with half a lemon. Put the remaining piece of rice paper over the top, pressing well with your hands. Leave to rest for 2 hours in a cool place – but not in the fridge.</p>

  <p class="para">Tip the torrone out of the tin onto a board and slice with a sharp knife. If you want to give the torrone as a gift, wrap it in greaseproof (waxed) paper and store in an airtight container for up to 2 months.</p>

    <p class="box-head">Toasting nuts</p>

    <p class="box-para">Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas mark 4. Put the nuts on a baking sheet and toast for about 15 minutes, until light golden brown and crunchy. If you haven’t been able to find skinned nuts, toasting will make it easy to rub off the skins. Set aside to cool.</p>
