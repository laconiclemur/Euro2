<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">W</span><small>HEN MY WIFE</small>, Stacy, and I started dating, we went out for dinner on my days off because I didn’t want to cook. We enjoyed trying different restaurants in Atlanta, where we were living at the time, but as we spent more time together and got to know each other better, she decided she’d cook for me. And I let her. Every chef will tell you that when someone is willing to cook for you, you wholeheartedly say yes.</p>
<p class="indent">I remember her making pork ribs in a slow cooker, deviled eggs with bacon and cheese, and so many other things that made me think, “This is the right girl for me.” I would eat anything she made.</p>
<p class="indent">In this chapter, you’ll find recipes for things Stacy and I like to make on our rare days off when we have friends over to watch football or for drinks before going out. I’ve also included a few recipes for things you can pickle. I like pickled vegetables, especially in salads just to mix it up a bit and add a little more flavor.</p>
<p class="indent">In this chapter you’ll also find the recipe for my famous <span class="color"><a href="#chapter01section06"><b><i>Pepperoni Sauce</i></b></a></span> (<a href="#page_12">page 12</a>), which I made for the <i>Top Chef All-Stars</i> finale. Not only did <i>Food &amp; Wine Magazine</i>’s Gail Simmons rave about the sauce, calling it “crazy business,” after the show was over fans and reporters kept saying, “Sorry you didn’t win, but can we have the recipe for your pepperoni sauce—it sounds <a id="page_2"/>amazing!” At the finale the sauce was a gamble because I’d never made it before, and it turned out to be the greatest risk I ever took. I saw pepperoni in the market that day and just made up the sauce on the fly by layering tomato, fennel seed, onion, chili flakes, white wine, stock, and pepperoni. I pureed the heck out of it, and from the smell alone I <i>knew</i> I had a winner. There’s a little heat, some cured sausage flavor and fennel, and it goes great with chicken thighs or wings . . . or just out of the pan with a spoon.</p>
