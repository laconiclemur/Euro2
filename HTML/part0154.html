<p class="first_paragraph_ch_ts" id="sab0000838"><a id="pg211" class="pcalibre calibre3"></a>My parents are from Extremadura, in south-west Spain, an area famous for its Iberian pigs and for producing the very best <em class="calibre9">jamón</em>. We used to go on holiday there when I was a child, and when we came back home to Santurtzi our car would be full of sausages that we’d made from a pig we’d slaughtered. At home, we had a <em class="calibre9">trastero</em> (storage room), not much more than a small dark hole with a door, and we’d hang all our homemade chorizo and <em class="calibre9">morcilla</em> inside there to cure. Every time you opened the door you would get a waft of cured meat. When I came back from school, before going on to judo or whatever sports I was doing, I’d cut off a small slice of <em class="calibre9">morcilla</em> or chorizo with a little knife and sandwich it in between pieces of bread for a snack. Now, when I go to the market in Bilbao the smell of the chorizo and <em class="calibre9">morcilla</em> reminds me of the <em class="calibre9">trastero</em> at home.</p>
<p class="toc" id="sab0000839">Santurtzi is a port town, so fish is pretty abundant, but growing up we’d eat meat a couple of times a week, probably, whether it was my mum’s braised rabbit (see <a href="part0163.html#pg222" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>) or the one-pan chicken in garlic sauce (see <a href="part0156.html#pg213" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>). And, of course, there was always the <em class="calibre9">trastero</em> to raid. My mum would always try to ensure that no part of the animals she cooked was wasted, so we ate a lot of offal too. It’s probably not surprising that, for me, these less popular cuts of meat still taste the best (the pan-fried sweetbreads <a href="part0184.html#pg252" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a> are a favourite). They are cheap, but you do need to pay attention to them: on the one hand, it’s important not to overcook livers and kidneys or they’ll be tough, but on the other, cuts like pig’s cheeks and ears need slow braising to get to the tender, melt-in-the-mouth stage where they fall off the bone. The main thing I learned from my mother’s cooking, and I apply it to my menus now, is that you don’t need to buy premium cuts to enjoy the best meat.</p>
