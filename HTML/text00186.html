 MANGO &amp; PASSION FRUIT JAM ROLY-POLY</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_blue" id="nad0001636">
<em>I don’t remember ever eating a jam roly-poly as a child, but my husband does. So when he told me, ‘I used to eat jam roly-poly at school,’ that for me was a challenge right there! Why have any old jam roly-poly when you can have a mango and passion fruit one? This is a steamed pudding the old-fashioned way, but with a modern tropical twist. The jam recipe here makes about 500g and only about a third of it is needed for the roly-poly but it’s tricky to make in much smaller quantities. The good news is that it keeps really well in a jar in the fridge, so you’ll have some left over for another time.</em>

<p class="method" id="nad0001648">
<span class="blue">
<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 For the jam, put the mango, passion fruit pulp and sugar into a pan and stir to combine, then bring the mixture to the boil.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001649">
<span class="blue">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Bring the mixture to 105°C, then take off the heat and place in a bowl to cool completely.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001650">
<span class="blue">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 180°C/160°C fan/gas 4 and place a deep roasting dish in the bottom, making sure there is a shelf directly above it. Place a large sheet of foil on your work surface. Place a large sheet of greaseproof paper on top of it, the same size, and grease the top of the paper all over.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001651">
<span class="blue">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Put the flour into a bowl with the butter and suet and rub with your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Make a well in the centre and add the milk, then bring the dough together.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001652">
<span class="blue">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Roll out the dough on a floured surface to a square roughly 30 x 30cm. Spread about 150g of the jam all over the square, leaving just the edges bare. (Store the remaining jam in a jar in the fridge to use for something else.)</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001653">
<span class="blue">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Roll up the dough like a Swiss roll, and seal the long seam and the edges tightly. Place on the buttered paper, seam-side down.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001654">
<span class="blue">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Wrap the roll in the paper and foil loosely, as it will expand in the oven. Seal the edges, then place directly on the oven shelf and bake for 1 hour.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001655">
<span class="blue">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 Leave in the wrapping for 10 minutes after baking, then unravel, slice and serve. We like to eat this hot out of the oven with cold ice cream, or, if we’re being nostalgic for my husband’s sake, we have it with custard.</p>
