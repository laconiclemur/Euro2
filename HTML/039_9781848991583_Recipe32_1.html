<h5 class="h5"><a id="pageid_49"/><b>Medallions of Pork</b> <span class="smfont">with</span> <b>Coriander</b> <span class="smfont">and</span> <b>Garlic</b></h5>
<p class="normal"><b>I often make this dish for myself at home, partly because it’s so quick, but also as I love the mix of flavors. It’s important, however, to use really good-quality meat to make sure the result is really tender. The garlic, sautéed in its skin until soft, perfectly complements the nuttiness of the crushed coriander seeds, then both combine with the buttery pork juices and fresh cilantro. All these great flavours are then served with succulent slices of pork tenderloin. Fantastic!</b></p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">SERVES</span></b> 4</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 5 minutes, plus making the stock and at least 1 hour marinating</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 15 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 boneless pork tenderloins, about 10 ounces each, trimmed and cut into 1-inch-thick slices</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ teaspoon coriander seeds, crushed</p>
<p class="acktxt">8 garlic cloves, unpeeled and lightly crushed</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon vegetable oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">7 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons Chicken Stock (see <a href="007_9781848991583_Recipe1.html#pageid_16">page 16</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 small handful cilantro leaves, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground white pepper</p>
<p class="acktxt">boiled, mashed carrot, to serve</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Put the pork in a large dish, pour the olive oil over and sprinkle with the crushed coriander seeds. Cover with plastic wrap and leave to marinate in the refrigerator at least 1 hour until ready to use.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil over high heat. Add the garlic, then turn the heat down to low and simmer 5 minutes, or until soft, taking care to simmer and not boil, so the skins stay attached to the garlic. Lift the cloves out with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels, then leave to one side.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Heat the vegetable oil with 1½ tablespoons of the butter in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the pork and when it just starts to brown, add the garlic. Cook the pork with the garlic 2 to 3 minutes on each side until both are golden brown, taking care not to burn the garlic. Remove the pork and garlic from the pan and leave to one side on a plate, covered with aluminum foil to keep warm.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Discard the fat in the pan, then return the pan to a medium heat, making sure it does not get too hot. Pour in the stock and deglaze the pan by stirring to remove any caramelized bits stuck to the bottom. Add the remaining butter to the pan, a little at a time, whisking to incorporate it into the sauce. When all the butter is added, add the unpeeled garlic and the resting juices from the pork and heat through.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> Just before serving, add the fresh cilantro leaves to the sauce and season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon the sauce over the pork and serve with mashed carrot.</p>
