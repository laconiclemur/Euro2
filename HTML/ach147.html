<p class="author1"><span class="txit">petto di pollo semplice alla salvia</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This is an easy and tasty recipe to prepare. The secret is to control the heat of the pan so the chicken breast does not brown too quickly and the meat remains tender and moist. Serve this dish with a <a class="nounder" href="ach109.html#page_216">tossed green salad, sautéed broccoli rabe</a>, <a class="nounder" href="ach118.html#page_230">Roasted Vegetables</a>, or a simple <a class="nounder" href="ach122.html#page_236">Carrot Salad</a>.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon butter, cut into thirds</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 teaspoons canola or olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 fresh sage leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup dry white wine</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Remove the white tendons from the chicken meat and the tender chicken pieces (the fillets) that are not part of the whole breast and discard. The chicken breasts should be evenly thick, about 1 inch. If necessary, place each breast between two sheets of waxed paper or plastic wrap and pound slightly to achieve an even thickness.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Season the chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. In a large skillet set over medium-low heat, warm two thirds of the butter with the oil. Add the sage to the pan. When the butter begins to foam, add the chicken breasts, smooth side down.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Cook slowly, lightly browning the breasts, about 6 minutes. Turn the breasts and continue cooking to lightly brown the other side, about 6 minutes. Add the wine and the remaining butter to the pan. Increase the heat to medium-high and reduce the liquid until slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Transfer the chicken to a plate, pour the sauce over the top, and serve immediately.</p>
