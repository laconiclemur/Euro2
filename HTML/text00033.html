</h1>
<p class="pf">I was fourteen and my sister Marion was ten. We were representing our family at our neighbors’ church—the Floodwood Bible Chapel—at their annual “spiritual revival” campaign. Our neighbors had come to our confirmations and baptisms in the Lutheran church, and our parents thought it was only right that somebody from our family reciprocate and attend our neighbors’ “important event.”</p>
<p>The little white wooden church sat right in the middle of town, next to the post office and across the street from Koskela’s Café. It looked friendly enough, though not particularly inviting. When the front door opened, people streamed into the church.</p>
<p>Marion and I sat about halfway back in the center of the pew, thinking we could hide within the crowd. Stretched across the front of the church just below the ceiling was a banner that read in big block letters, “HEAVEN AND HOW TO GET THERE.”</p>
<p>The preacher stood tall in the center of the stage, hair slicked back. He had a big mouthful of teeth and when he launched into his message it was directed, we thought, right at the two of us. We cringed.</p>
<p>The neighbor lady nodded her approval. Her family agreed. After all, her kids had been told not to associate with us because we were sinners. They had heard that we went to movies and school dances and played Old Maid with cards. We went to the carnival when it was in town. Isä had bought a television when they were first available, much to their unvoiced disapproval. Plus, our father was known to drink too much and our mother was always pregnant. To top it off, we were Finns. Heathens.</p>
<p>They probably thought they would help us out by taking at least a couple of us to their revival meeting. Maybe we could be saved.</p>
<p>It was a hot July day in Minnesota. The men and boys were wearing loose white shirts and their Sunday-best pants. The women, in their long, printed dresses, scarves, and Cuban-heeled shoes with black socks, responded with “Yes, yes” as the preacher became more and more emphatic.</p>
<p>“You!” he suddenly pointed at us. “You need to be saved! You need to be born again! Come forward—be saved!” We wondered what he meant. Saved from what?</p>
<p>Marion and I looked at each other quizzically, while the crowd around us nodded and swayed. It was getting pretty warm.</p>
<p>“Now,” said the preacher, “I’ll sing a song for you!”</p>
<p>The piano was backed up to the wall on the left side of the stage. He pulled out the bench, craned his neck toward the assembly, and clanked out a couple of chords. Then he launched into a nasaly rendition of a praise-and-glory song. The congregation joined in. They knew all the words. A few started toward the front of the sanctuary, somewhat entranced.</p>
<p>“Come and be saved!”</p>
<p>When he pronounced his final benediction “See you in the morning of the glory land!” we knew one thing for sure—we were getting out of there as soon as we could, even if we had to walk the four miles home.</p>
