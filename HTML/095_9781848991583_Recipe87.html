<h5 class="h5"><a id="pageid_143"/><b>Strawberry Jelly Puree</b> <span class="smfont">with</span> <b>Elderflower Yogurt</b> <span class="smfont">and</span> <b>Sesame Nougatine</b></h5>
<p class="normal"><b>I recommend you wait for the strawberry season before making this dish—the quality of the fruit will make a massive difference to the taste of the jelly. I also use a lovely elderflower cordial, which is not as sweet as some cordials. To finish the dessert, I use black and white sesame seeds made into a lovely transparent, glasslike nougatine, which is very crunchy, but absolutely delicious! If you cannot find liquid glucose, use light corn syrup.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt">3⅓ cups strawberries, hulled</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon sugar</p>
<p class="acktxta">2 tablespoons white balsamic vinegar</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE ELDERFLOWER YOGURT</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">1¼ cups plain Greek yogurt</p>
<p class="acktxt">⅔ cup cream cheese</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 tablespoons elderflower cordial</p>
<p class="acktxta">1 tablespoon confectioner’s sugar, sifted</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE SESAME NOUGATINE</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">⅓ cup black sesame seeds</p>
<p class="acktxt">⅓ cup white sesame seeds</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons liquid glucose</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup less 1 tablespoon superfine sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">5 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> To make the strawberry jelly puree, put the gelatin in a medium bowl with enough cold water to cover, then leave to soften 5 minutes. Drain and return the gelatin to the bowl. Heat a large, nonstick skillet over high heat. Add 2 cups of the strawberries and the sugar and cook 2 minutes, tossing to coat the strawberries in the sugar. Remove the pan from the heat, cover and leave to one side 3 minutes.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Transfer the strawberries and any juices in the pan to a blender and blend to a puree, then pass through a fine strainer, using a ladle to help you, directly onto the soaked gelatin and whisk briskly until it dissolves. Put the bowl directly in a larger bowl of ice water to cool rapidly. When the mixture starts to set, divide it equally into four tumblers. Put them in the refrigerator to set at least another 30 minutes. Meanwhile, finely dice slightly less than 1 cup of the remaining strawberries, then put them into a bowl with the vinegar and leave to macerate 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Put all the elderflower yogurt ingredients in a separate bowl and mix well to combine, then cover and leave in the refrigerator until needed.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> When the strawberry mixture has set, spoon the yogurt into the four glasses. Using a slotted spoon, add the macerated strawberries on top, then leave in the refrigerator to set while you make the nougatine.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> Heat the oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Put all the nougatine ingredients in a nonstick skillet. Add 1 tablespoon water and stir to combine, then heat over medium heat 3 minutes, or until the butter melts and the sugar dissolves. Turn the heat up and cook 4 to 5 minutes until the mixture just starts to turn golden brown. Pour it onto the prepared baking sheet and spread out using a wet spatula. Bake 12 minutes, or until golden brown; it shouldn’t be as dark as caramel. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and leave the nougatine to cool on the tray until crisp. Break the nougatine into large pieces. Remove the glasses from the refrigerator and balance a piece of nougatine in the top of each dessert, then put the rest in a bowl to share.</p>
