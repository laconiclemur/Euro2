<p class="normal"><b>Spaetzle means “little sparrow,” and this type of pasta traditionally comes from Baden, in Germany, but it is also very popular near my home region of Alsace, in the east of France, where I first tried it. The dough for the spaetzle can be made with spinach puree or cheese and it is often served with meat, but at The Vineyard restaurant we serve it with guinea fowl.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 30 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxta"><span class="smallcaps"><b>COOKING TIME</b></span> 35 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">2½ cups buckwheat flour</p>
<p class="acktxt">6 extra-large eggs</p>
<p class="acktxt">¼ teaspoon roughly chopped tarragon leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ garlic clove, finely chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons very finely grated Parmesan cheese</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 guinea fowl breast halves, skin on</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ teaspoon finely chopped rosemary leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> To make the spaetzle, put the flour, eggs, tarragon, garlic and Parmesan in a large mixing bowl and whisk with a strong whisk or wooden spoon 5 minutes, or until the mixture starts to become elastic. Finish the dough by hand, almost slapping the mixture on the side of the bowl about 3 minutes until it becomes an elastic, sticky dough. Meanwhile, bring a large saucepan of water to a boil and stir in 3 tablespoons of the oil. Fill a large bowl with ice water. Heat the oven to 350°F.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Put one-third of the dough in a large metal colander then, holding it about 2 inches above the pan of gently boiling water, press the dough through the holes of the colander into the water, using either your hand or a spatula; they look like little worms going through and will break off naturally, so you don’t need to cut them. Cook the spaetzle 1 to 2 minutes until they float to the surface. Scoop them out with a slotted spoon and drop them straight into the ice water. When they are cold, lift out with a slotted spoon and dry on a clean dish towl. Repeat with the remaining dough until all of it is used. Leave the spaetzle to one side on the towel.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Heat a large, ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Season the skin of the guinea fowl with salt. Add the remaining oil and half the butter to the pan. When the butter is foaming, add the guinea fowl, skin-side down, and cook 2 to 3 minutes until it is golden brown. Turn the breasts over, transfer the pan to the oven and roast 8 to 10 minutes until the guinea fowl are cooked through. Cover them with foil and leave to rest in a warm place.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Return the skillet to medium heat and heat until the cooking juices and butter start to turn a hazelnut brown color. Add the spaetzle and cook 2 to 3 minutes, turning once, until they are golden and crisp on the outside but still soft inside. Carefully lift out them out with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> Add slightly less than ½ cup of water to the pan and deglaze by stirring to remove any caramelized bits stuck to the bottom. Add the remaining butter and the rosemary and simmer 1 minute, then season with salt and pepper to taste. Thickly slice the guinea fowl, top with the spaetzle and spoon over the cooking juices to serve.</p>
