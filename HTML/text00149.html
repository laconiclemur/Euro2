 SUMAC &amp; LEMON THYME FOCACCIA</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_pink" id="nad0000976">
<em>Bread was the one thing that I used to be afraid of where baking was concerned. It took many a disaster before I really began to understand the process. I still have much to learn, but one of my favourite breads that I’ve learnt to bake on this journey of bread discovery is focaccia. I particularly like this sumac and thyme version, which is so moist that it really doesn’t need anything else served alongside it.</em>

<p class="method" id="nad0000986">
<span class="pink">
<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Place the flour in a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the salt to one side of the bowl and the yeast to the opposite side.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000987">
<span class="pink">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Add the olive oil and water and mix to bring the dough together. If you are using a stand mixer, attach the dough hook and knead on high for 5 minutes. If you are kneading by hand, lightly grease the surface of your worktop and knead for 10 minutes. The dough will be quite sticky at first, so if you are kneading by hand you may need to add up to 75g more flour to help make it workable.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000988">
<span class="pink">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 The dough should now be smooth and stretchy. Place it in a greased bowl, cover and leave to double in size. This could take an hour, sometimes less, sometimes more, depending on how warm your room is.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000989">
<span class="pink">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Once the dough has doubled in size, turn it out on to a work surface and divide it in half.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000990">
<span class="pink">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Place a piece of dough on a large flat baking tray, then grease your hands and push the dough out to cover as much of the tray as possible.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000991">
<span class="pink">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Repeat with the second piece of dough, then cover both trays with greased cling film and leave for 1 hour.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000992">
<span class="pink">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Preheat the oven to 220°C/200°C fan/gas 7.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000993">
<span class="pink">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 Get rid of the cling film, then, using your fingertips, press indents into the dough. Drizzle with plenty of olive oil, so you have puddles of oil in the indents you made. Sprinkle over the lemon thyme leaves and rock salt.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000994">
<span class="pink">
<strong>9.</strong>
</span>
 Bake for 15–18 minutes, swapping the two trays over halfway through cooking to ensure an even bake.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000995">
<span class="pink">
<strong>10.</strong>
</span>
 Once out of the oven, sprinkle over the sumac while the bread is still warm. I like to serve the focaccia with good olive oil and balsamic vinegar.</p>
