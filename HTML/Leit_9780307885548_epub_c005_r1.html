  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">T</span>his dish is from the Alentejo, Portugal’s vast plains region, but my version bears only a passing resemblance to the original. Portuguese cooks typically fry the marinated cubes of pork loin in lard, making for some tough chewing, even with Portugal’s tender pork. The version I was weaned on was braised, requiring hours of cooking so that the meat would soften and break down. I’m indebted to Jean Anderson, author of <em>The Food of Portugal,</em> who suggested I use pork shoulder (butt), an excellent choice for juicy, tender morsels—with significantly less time on the stove.</p>

  <p class="extract"><strong><span class="small">ATENÇÃO</span></strong> <img alt="" src="../Images/Leit_9780307885548_epub_150_r1.jpg" /> <em>This dish is usually served over deep-fried potato cubes.

Also, the pork needs to marinate at least overnight, so keep that in mind when planning your menu.</em></p>

  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">T</span>he name of this recipe is perhaps the most confounding in all of Portugal. In the town of Mealhada, in the central region where roast suckling pig reigns, <em>torresmos</em> is a plate of pork cracklings.

In the Azores, especially on the north side of the island of São Miguel, where my family is from, it’s the roasted butt section of a pork shoulder. This recipe is an adaptation of my aunt Irena’s <em>torresmos</em>.

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Toss the lamb with the orange juice, garlic, ginger, and mint in a large bowl. Let marinate, covered, in the fridge for 4 hours.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Dump the lamb into a colander set over a bowl to catch the marinade. Reserve the liquid. Dry the lamb very well with paper towels; if you don’t, the pieces will steam, not sear. Generously season the lamb with salt and pepper.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat until very hot. Working in 3 or 4 batches, sear the lamb pieces, stirring occasionally, until browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a bowl.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent"><a id="page153"></a>Return all the lamb to the pot, sprinkle with the flour, and stir to combine. Pour in the reserved marinade and the stock. Add the drained soaked beans (if using canned beans, add them in the next step), the carrots, bay leaves, cinnamon, oregano, star anise, coriander seeds, cumin, lemon zest, and lemon juice, cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 1¼ hours, stirring occasionally.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Spoon in the tomatoes and the canned beans, if using. Continue simmering, uncovered if the stew is thin, until the lamb is tender and the beans are soft but still hold their shape, 15 to 20 minutes more. Toss out the bay leaves, cinnamon sticks, and star anise. Take a taste and season the stew with salt and pepper, if needed.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">To serve, ladle into bowls and speckle with parsley.</p>
