<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0003193">There are two types of people: those who hate beetroot and those who love it. People often don’t like it because they think it’s too earthy – but they tend not to have eaten a good beetroot. This salad is sweet; people who think they don’t like beets love them when they try it. Ideally you should leave the <em class="calibre9">ajo blanco</em> ingredients to sit overnight, though you could leave them for just a couple of hours if you’re pressed for time.</p>
<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0003194">This goes especially well with fish.</p>

<h5 class="serves">FOR 4–6</h5>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0003195">1kg mixed baby beetroots, a combination of normal, golden, candy, white and the long, slim Cylindra variety (depending on what’s in season and what you can find)</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0003196">2 white peaches</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0003197">½ a bunch of land cress, rocket or watercress, to finish</p>
<p class="d_heads" id="sab0003198">For the <em class="calibre12">ajo blanco</em></p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0003199">½ a large loaf of white bread</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0003200">80g whole blanched almonds</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0003201">1 clove of garlic, crushed</p>

<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0003205">3 Granny Smith apples, peeled and cut into small chunks</p>

<div class="maincontent_wrapper">
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0003214">First, make the <em class="calibre9">ajo blanco</em>. Put the bread, almonds, garlic and milk into a bowl, mix together and refrigerate overnight. The next day, put the contents of the bowl into a food processor with the grapes, apples and vinegar and blend until you have a creamy purée with no lumps. Add the olive oil and continue blending until creamy and fairly smooth, then adjust the seasoning to taste.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0003215">Put the unpeeled beetroots into a large pan of water with a pinch of salt and bring to a gentle boil. Cook until the beets are soft. Rather than checking this by piercing them with a knife (which makes the juices run out), remove a beetroot and squeeze both sides with your fingers: if you don’t feel any resistance, they’re done. Drain the beetroots and push the skin off with your hands while still warm. Cut into roughly 2½cm cubes (so you can eat them in one bite) and leave to cool.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0003216">Peel the peaches and cut into the same size cubes as the beetroot.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0003217">To make the dressing, put the chopped dill, vinegar and oil into a large bowl and whisk together to emulsify. Add the beetroot and peach cubes, then season with salt and pepper – seasoning at this stage makes it easier to see how much you need. Leave to sit for 5 minutes, mixing occasionally, so that the beetroots lose their juices slightly and mix with the dressing.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0003218">Spoon the <em class="calibre9">ajo blanco</em> on to your plates, followed by the dressed beetroot and peach, and top with the leaves.</p>
