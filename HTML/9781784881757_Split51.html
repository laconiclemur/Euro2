<p class="tx2"><b>This delicately flavoured dish is a little like a French ratatouille. It is best made with summer produce to really appreciate the flavours. I like to eat it in a bowl for a quick lunch or serve it as a side dish for grilled meats. If you leave out the cheese it is lovely with grilled fish, too. Alternatively, add a poached egg and call it breakfast, or stir in some hot pasta shells and it will be a perfect pasta sauce. It keeps well for a couple of days in the fridge and is easily warmed through on the hob or in the microwave, making it a perfect lunchtime meal.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 6 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 onion, peeled and roughly chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 garlic cloves, peeled and lightly crushed</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>350 g (12 oz) courgettes (zucchini), sliced into rounds (a mixture of green and yellow, if possible)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt and freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>200 g (7 oz) ripe, flavourful tomatoes (round, cherry or plum), cut into 1 cm (½ in) cubes</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>125 g (4 oz) mozzarella, roughly torn</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>15 g (½ oz) parsley, roughly chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>15 g (½ oz) basil leaves, roughly torn</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and fry for about 10 minutes until the onion is translucent. Add the diced courgettes to the pan, season with salt and pepper, and toss through. Cook the courgettes for a few minutes, stirring frequently, until they start to become golden. Stir in the tomatoes and cook for a couple of minutes until they have just begun to soften and the courgettes are al dente. Serve straight away while the courgettes and tomatoes are still steaming hot, topped with the mozzarella and herbs.</p>
