<p class="chapterSubtitle">{ <span class="bi-color">salmón con guisantes–asturias</span> }</p>
</div>
<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">Asturias is famous for the salmon caught in its many rivers. When the fish return from the Atlantic to their spawning grounds in May, the first big catch of the season is called</span> campanu, <span class="italic">because church bells (</span>campanas<span class="italic">) have always pealed to signal its arrival. A favorite way of cooking salmon in Cangas de Onis, in the Picos de Europa, is with fresh green peas. Pepe Iglesias (see page 328) explained that the lettuce leaves that cover the peas and the fish produce steam that cooks the peas. Without any added water, the peas have a more intense sweet flavor.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 2</span></p>
<p class="qun">½ large onion, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">2 slices <span class="italic">jamón serrano</span> or prosciutto, sliced into ½-inch-wide strips</p>
<p class="qun">1½ tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">2 tablespoons butter</p>
<p class="qun">1⅔ cups fresh peas</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">6 to 8 romaine lettuce leaves</p>
<p class="qun">2 skinless salmon fillets (5 to 6 ounces each)</p>
<p class="qun1">¼ lemon</p>
<p class="recsum">Sauté the onion and <span class="italic">jamón</span> or prosciutto in the oil in a large skillet over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the onion is soft. Add 1 tablespoon of the butter and the peas, stir, and season with salt. Cover with the lettuce leaves, put on a tight-fitting lid so that the peas cook in the steam created by the lettuce, and cook over very low heat for 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Lift up a few of the lettuce leaves and put in the salmon fillets. Season with salt and lay half the remaining butter on each fillet. Replace the lettuce leaves, put the lid on, and cook over low heat for 6 to 10 minutes depending on the thickness of the fillets, or until the fish is done to your liking. The peas will be very soft—that is how they are supposed to be. Serve with a sprinkling of lemon juice, with the lettuce as an extra garnish.</p>
