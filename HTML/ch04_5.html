<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">CHORIZO WITH CIDER</h2>
<p class="chap-opener">Chorizo sausage cooked in cider is one of the easiest tapas to make – there are only two ingredients and no chopping involved. All you need is a pan and a bottle opener. And don’t forget the bread!</p>
<p class="recipe-head">SERVES 8 AS A TAPA</p>
<p class="recipe-head">PREPARATION TIME: 1 MINUTE</p>
<p class="recipe-head">COOKING TIME: 30 MINUTES</p>
<p class="recipe-list">4 FRESH SPICY CHORIZO SAUSAGES</p>
<p class="recipe-list">500 ML VINTAGE CIDER [STILL AND DRY]</p>
<p class="recipe-list">BREAD, TO SERVE</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> Place the chorizo sausages in a small pan (they should fit snugly) and pour over the cider. Cook over a high heat until the cider reduces down into a rich syrup – this should take about 30 minutes. Alternatively you can reduce the heat to low and leave the sausages cooking for up to an hour – they will be just as tasty and tender.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> Cut the chorizo into thick slices and serve hot with good bread.</p>
<p class="recipe-head">NOTE</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">Chorizo is well known outside of Spain but few realise how many different types there are, depending on the amount of spice (pimentón) used and whether it is smoked or unsmoked, fresh or cured… It’s incredibly versatile as it can be flashed under a hot grill for 2 minutes, cooked in cider or wine for half an hour or stewed for several hours. To me, whichever way it is prepared, chorizo always tastes delicious. Make sure you use fresh chorizo for this recipe as dry-cured chorizo will become very hard.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">HAM CROQUETTES</h2>
<p class="chap-opener">These deep-fried béchamel balls were sent from heaven to make us mortals a bit happier. Croquetas are famous throughout Spain – customers rave about the taste and texture while those who make them know that the best things in life come at a price – yes, they are time-consuming to prepare. I could tell you that this croquetas recipe is a treasured family recipe but the truth is that I have developed it over the years myself, and after endless research and cooking them literally hundreds of times, I believe these are among the best you will find. Enjoy!</p>
<p class="recipe-head">SERVES 6 / MAKES 24</p>

<p class="recipe-list">2 EGGS</p>
<p class="recipe-list">50 G DRIED BREADCRUMBS</p>
<p class="recipe-list">VEGETABLE OIL FOR DEEP-FRYING</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> Melt the butter in a pan over a medium heat and add the chopped onion and jamón serrano. Cook for a few minutes until the onion turns translucent but not coloured. Meanwhile, in a separate pan, bring the milk almost to boiling point and then set aside.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> Add the flour to the onion and cook for 5 minutes, stirring, until the flour has toasted a bit. Add the hot milk little by little, whisking all the time, to make a thick roux. Keep going until you have added all the milk and you have a smooth and silky béchamel. When it comes back to the boil reduce the heat to low and add the nutmeg, salt and pepper. Leave to simmer for about 40 minutes, whisking to make sure it doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><a id="pg94"/><span class="no">3</span> Line the bottom of a baking tray with baking parchment and then pour the béchamel into the baking tray. Spread it out and then immediately place a layer of cling film directly on top, making sure the cling flim is touching the surface of the béchamel as this will stop a skin from forming. Transfer to the fridge to chill completely.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">4</span> After 3 hours the béchamel should be firm enough to handle. Peel off the cling film, turn the béchamel out on to a floured surface and carefully peel away the baking parchment. Sprinkle with a little more flour and use a knife to cut the béchamel into strips and then small squares, about 4 cm square. Dust your hands with flour and roll these little squares into balls between your hands.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">5</span> Beat the egg in a bowl and spread the breadcrumbs out on a plate. Dip each ball in the egg and then roll in the breadcrumbs before placing on a clean plate. You can chill these in the fridge at this point, if you want to cook them later (or freeze them for next time).</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">6</span> Heat the oil in a large deep pan until it reaches 180°C. If you don’t have a thermometer you can check whether the oil is ready by dropping a small square of bread into the oil – it should turn golden in about 30 seconds. Fry the croquetas in small batches until they are golden and crisp (this should take about 1½ minutes). Remove and drain on kitchen paper while you cook the rest.</p>
<p class="recipe-head1">NOTE</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">Enjoy the unctuous creaminess of real Spanish ham croquetas. <i>Salud</i>!</p>

<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> To make the meatballs, soak the bread in the milk and leave for a few minutes.

<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> Knead the mixture with clean hands for a couple of minutes until the ingredients are well combined (don’t overwork it or the meatballs will become rubbery). Roll the mixture into small balls, about the size of a walnut, and place in a shallow roasting tin. The traditional way of cooking these is to fry them in batches in a little olive oil over a medium heat but I prefer to do it the easy way and roast them. Simply drizzle with a little olive oil (Spanish, if possible) and cook for 10 minutes in the oven at 180°C/gas mark 4.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> Meanwhile, make the sauce. Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat and add the onion, garlic and carrot and cook for a few minutes until the onion is translucent, but not coloured. Add the thyme, rosemary, salt and pepper, sugar and wine and flambé by setting light to the pan using a lighter or some long matches. (Flambéing is optional!) Simmer until the wine has reduced by half and then add the chopped tomatoes. Cook for a further 5 minutes, then add the peas and meatballs and cook together for another 15 minutes until the meatballs are cooked through. <i>Salud</i>!</p>

I can’t remember not having pork cheeks on the menu of my restaurants; the customers love them as much as I do. Some people say that marinating meat in red wine for 24 hours tenderizes it. I have done this literally hundreds of times but all I can say is that the meat tastes a bit more acidic and looks more purple. My suggestion is not to bother.</p>

Bring to the boil, cover with a lid and cook in the oven for 3 hours, turning the shanks over two or three times during cooking so that no one part of the shank dries out. After 2½ hours, clean and prepare the artichokes (see <a href="ch05.html#pg122">here</a>) and add them whole to the pan. They will cook to perfection in the last 30 minutes. After 3 hours the meat should be beautifully tender and falling off the bone.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">5</span> If you like the rustic approach you can serve the dish pretty much as it is. If you want to go a step further you can remove the lamb and artichokes from the pan, skim the fat from the sauce and then strain the sauce into a clean pan. Reduce down until the sauce is very thick and sticky and then pour over the lamb and artichokes.</p>
<p class="recipe-head">NOTE</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">The key for intense-tasting sauces when you are braising or slow-cooking any dish, is to brown and caramelize all the ingredients really well before you add any liquid to the pan.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-head-left" id="list46"><a id="pg106"/>LECHAZO ASADO</h2>
<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">ROAST LAMB</h2>
<p class="chap-opener1">Throughout Castilla traditional shepherds have existed for centuries. Three particular sheep breeds (<span class="bold-italic">churra</span>, <span class="bold-italic">ojalada</span> and <span class="bold-italic">castellana</span>) were celebrated for their flavour and these are the ones that have endured throughout the years. In Castilla this dish has to be prepared with a milk-fed lamb – the texture and flavour of an older animal simply doesn’t compare. My family comes from Burgos in Castillay León and I have eaten this celebration dish all my life. It is traditionally cooked in baking houses, known as <span class="bold-italic">asadores</span>, where the <span class="bold-italic">lechazo</span>, or cooking of a whole milk-fed lamb, is the main event. The huge ovens here are wood-fired and have a special mechanism of a rotating stone base, which allows the chefs to turn the roasting trays inside the oven easily. Everyone should experience the <span class="bold-italic">lechazo</span> at least once in their lives.</p>
<p class="chap-opener-indent">Let me show you how to replicate the wood-fired experience at home. Ask your butcher to source milk-fed lamb; alternatively you can use 2 shoulders from an older lamb and just cook them for longer.</p>
<p class="recipe-head">SERVES 8</p>
<p class="recipe-head">PREPARATION TIME: 5 MINUTES</p>
<p class="recipe-head">COOKING TIME: 2¼–2½ HOURS</p>
<p class="recipe-list">1 LARGE MILK-FED LAMB, ABOUT 5–6 KG, OR 2 SHOULDERS OF SPRING LAMB</p>
<p class="recipe-list">100 G LARD [USE OLIVE OIL AS A LAST RESORT]</p>
<p class="recipe-list">3 TABLESPOONS ROCK SALT</p>
<p class="recipe-list">1 ONION, QUARTERED</p>
<p class="recipe-list">4 GARLIC CLOVES, CRUSHED</p>
<p class="recipe-list">1 BAY LEAF</p>
<p class="recipe-list">200 ML WHITE WINE</p>
<p class="recipe-list">1 BUNCH OF THYME</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> Preheat the oven to 160°C/gas mark 3. Rub the lamb all over with the lard and rock salt and place it skin-side down on an oven rack.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> Place the onion, garlic, bay leaf and white wine in a separate roasting tin and position the oven rack with the lamb on top of it (the roasting tin is only there to catch and flavour the dripping). Place the bunch of thyme in a small flameproof, ovenproof dish in the bottom of the oven or somewhere where it won’t come into contact with the lamb or the fat – the idea is to completely dry out the thyme. Cook for 1 hour 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><a id="pg107"/><span class="no">3</span> Remove the lamb and roasting tin from the oven, turn the lamb over and spoon some of the juices in the tray over the skin. Add 1 glass of water to the juices so that there is some sauce by the end. Return to the oven. By now the thyme should be completely dry. Taking care not to burn the lamb or the sides of your oven, light the thyme sprigs using some long matches and quickly close the oven door. The lovely fragrant smoke will surround the lamb, creating the effect of a wood-fired oven. (You could also burn wooden skewers or toothpicks for this purpose). Roast the lamb, skin-side up, for another hour or until tender. If you are cooking shoulder, you will need to cook it for an extra hour or so.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">4</span> Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 10–15 minutes before bringing to the table. Traditionally the lamb is cut into portions with the edge of a plate to show your guests how tender the meat has become. This is perfect served with panadera potatoes (see <a href="ch09.html#pg218">here</a>) and the juices from the tray poured over.</p>
<p class="recipe-head">NOTE</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">If your butcher cannot get hold of milk-fed lamb, make sure that it is young spring lamb.</p>

<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> Trim the pork fillet of any excess fat and then cut into 2-cm cubes. Place the meat in a large mixing bowl and add the pimentón, cumin, some black pepper, oregano, thyme and garlic. Mix well, drizzle over the olive oil and leave to marinate for at least an hour, but anything up to 2 days is fine.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> Meanwhile, make the mojo picón. Start by frying the bread in a little olive oil, drain on kitchen paper and tear into pieces. Using a pestle and mortar, mash together the garlic, cayenne chillies, cumin seeds, pimentón, fried bread, vinegar and salt until you have a smooth paste. You could also use a food processor for this bit. Start adding the olive oil in a thin drizzle while you are still mixing.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> When you are ready to cook the pinchos, thread the meat on to skewers (if you are using wooden skewers it’s a good idea to soak them in water for 30 minutes to stop them burning). Pinchos morunos can be cooked over charcoal (the best way, in my opinion), under a hot grill or in a griddle pan over a very high heat. Cook for about 2 minutes on each side – you want them to be cooked through but still juicy on the inside. Season with salt and pepper and serve with the mojo picón.</p>
<p class="recipe-head1">OMAR’S NOTE</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">I absolutely love this marinade but there are times when I haven’t got the energy or time for chopping, marinating or skewering. A quick alternative is to marinate a whole piece of beef and cook it like a large steak, either in a pan or on the barbecue. Simply let it rest for a few minutes after cooking and then slice into thick slices with a sharp knife. Fantastic results with about half the effort – what could be better?</p>
<p class="recipe-head1" id="note7">NOTE</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">If you want to make these with chicken, use the thigh. If you are using beef use the skirt or flank and if you want to make lamb skewers use the leg.</p>
