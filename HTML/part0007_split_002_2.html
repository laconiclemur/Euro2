  <p class="chap-para">This lovely, old-fashioned soup dates from the time before frozen peas were available, and Italian housewives kept dried split peas to use when fresh peas were not in season. When cooked, their texture is quite dense, so to balance this I have kept the potatoes and pancetta in chunky pieces rather than blending the soup. However, if you prefer, you can blend it before you add the milk and egg yolk mixture at the end. The addition of lettuce gives the soup a pleasant contrasting freshness. Split peas don’t normally need pre-soaking, but check the packet instructions.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">300g/10½oz/1½ cups dried split peas</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">50g/1¾oz/4 tbsp butter</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 small onion, sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 celery heart, sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">85g/3oz pancetta, cubed</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 potatoes, cut into chunks 1 litre/1¾ pints/4 cups hot vegetable</p>

  <p class="ing1"><a href="part0007_split_013.html#ch1sec12a" class="calibre1">broth</a></p>

  <p class="ing1">500ml/18fl oz/2cups hot water</p>

  <p class="ing1">250g/9oz lettuce</p>

  <p class="ing1">225ml/8fl oz/scant 1 cup milk</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 egg yolks, beaten</p>

  <p class="ing2">grated Parmesan, to serve</p>

  <p class="para">Rinse the split peas in cold water, discarding any small stones or other impurities; set aside.</p>

  <p class="para">Heat the olive oil and half of the butter in a large saucepan on a medium heat. Add the onion, celery and pancetta and sweat for 5 minutes, until softened.</p>

  <p class="para">Stir in the potatoes and split peas, add the broth and water, cover with a lid and cook on a low heat for 1½ hours, stirring from time to time to prevent the peas from sticking.</p>

  <p class="para">About 15 minutes before the end of cooking time, put the lettuce leaves in a pan of boiling water and simmer for 6 minutes. Drain, squeezing out excess water, and leave to cool, then slice thinly lengthways. Set aside.</p>

  <p class="para1">Melt the remaining butter and transfer to a bowl with the milk and egg yolks, whisking well. Remove the pea soup from the heat, stir in the milk mixture and serve sprinkled with the sliced lettuce and Parmesan.</p>
