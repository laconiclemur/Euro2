  <p class="center-para"><a id="page_53" class="calibre1"></a>‘Slow cooking’ conjures up images of heavy meals for colder months, but the idea of taking things slowly can also create light, fresh-tasting dishes for snacks and summer eating.</p>

  <p class="center-para">Marinating is a form of ‘slow cooking’ that doesn’t need the stove or oven, but it does need several hours for the flavours to mingle and marry. It’s a simple technique with stunning results: as the food absorbs the flavourings, the taste improves. The dishes are enjoyed cold as an <em class="calibre4">antipasto</em>, snack or light but satisfying meal and can include all sorts of ingredients, from pumpkin in the <em class="calibre4">antipasto di zucca</em> to mackerel marinated with mint, and rabbit in a Tuscan salad.</p>

  <p class="center-para">While writing and testing recipes for this book, I encountered lots of slow-cooked dishes that could effortlessly be made into other meals. Once you’ve made a beef or chicken broth, for example, you can transform the main ingredient into another course or a meal for another day. Boiled beef can be transformed into a salad, meatballs or even burgers. Boiled chicken also makes a delicious salad. When I was brought up, food was never wasted and I still maintain those values. My sister Adriana is a genius at this and comes up with some amazing dishes using leftovers that most people would bin! Not only is it part of our culture never to waste food, but it also makes cooking a fun and imaginative process.</p>
