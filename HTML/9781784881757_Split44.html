<h1 class="chapter">aniseed biscuits</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>These biscuits are deliciously delicate (see <a href="9781784881757_Split43.html#page_70">picture</a>, top right). Vary the spices as you wish – the darker the spices, the darker the biscuit.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">MAKES APPROX. 24 BISCUITS</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>150 g (5 oz/⅔ cup) caster (superfine) sugar</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>150 ml (5 fl oz/⅔ cup) water</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>75 g (2½ oz) runny honey</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>250 g (9 oz/2 cups) ‘00’ or gluten-free flour, plus extra for dusting</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 heaped teaspoon bicarbonate of soda (baking soda)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>50 g (2 oz) candied fruit, finely diced</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>75 g (2½ oz) walnuts, finely chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>finely grated zest of 1 orange</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 heaped teaspoon aniseed or ground star anise</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>10 g (¼ oz) mixture of ground coriander, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg (to taste)</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Preheat the oven to 160°C (300°F/Gas 2) and line 2 baking trays with baking parchment. Put the sugar, water and honey in a saucepan over a high heat until it reaches a gentle boil and the sugar has dissolved.</p>
<p class="tx">Put the rest of the ingredients in a mixing bowl and pour the hot sugar syrup into it, taking care not to splash yourself. Stir until it forms a dough. Tip the dough out onto a floured work surface, divide it in half and make 2 long sausages measuring approximately 3 cm (1¼ in) wide. Cut each sausage into 12 equal-sized pieces. Roll each piece into a ball the size of a walnut and coat it in flour. Place the balls onto the lined baking trays, spaced about 5 cm (2 in) apart. Bake for 10 minutes or until the tops crack and they become golden brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on a wire rack. Eat straight away or store in airtight container for up to 3 days.</p>
