<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Baking a loin in a salt crust gives the pork gamier, earthier flavors that combine perfectly with a host of juxtaposing sauces—from sweet compotes of apples or pears to a purée of chestnuts <a href="172-chapter124.html#page_246"><span class="red">(see page 246)</span></a> to blue cheese sauces.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>4½&gt; POUNDS/2 KG COARSE KOSHER SALT</li>
<li>3 EGG WHITES</li>
<li>2¼ POUNDS/1 KG BONELESS CENTER-CUT PORK LOIN ROAST, PREFERABLY THE BLADE (OR BUTT) END, IN 1 PIECE</li>
<li>BLUE CHEESE SAUCE <a href="182-chapter130.html#page_259">(PAGE 259)</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>PEAR COMPOTE</li>
<li>2 POUNDS/910 G RIPE BUT FIRM PEARS, SUCH AS CONFERENCE, CONCORDE, ANJOU, OR WILLIAMS</li>
<li>1/2 LEMON</li>
<li>3 TABLESPOONS SUGAR</li>
<li>1 SMALL CINNAMON STICK</li>
<li>1/4 CUP/60 ML WHITE WINE</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Preheat the oven to 400°F/200°C/gas mark 6.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a large bowl, mix the salt with the egg whites until the salt feels slightly damp.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Line a roasting pan or an ovenproof baking dish large enough to accommodate the loin with a piece of parchment paper or aluminum foil (for easier clean up). Spread about one-fourth of the salt in a layer approximately ½&gt; inch/1.25 cm thick across the bottom; pat down. Lay the loin on top, and cover completely with the remaining salt, in an even ½&gt;-inch-/1.25-cm-thick layer, patting it down around the loin. Be sure the entire piece of pork is thoroughly and evenly covered.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Gently—without shifting the packed salt—place the covered loin in the oven. Bake for about 50 minutes. The salt will form a hard, browned shell. Remove from the oven. An instant-read thermometer, worked through the salt and into the center of the loin, should read at least 145°F/63°C.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Have a large bowl ready for the salt crust. Using a wooden mallet or hammer, carefully break open the salt shell by tapping gently. Pull off the chunks of salt and then remove the loin. With a pastry brush, sweep away any salt grains. On a clean surface, cut the loin crosswise into pencil-thin slices and layer on a serving platter or plates.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">6.</span> <strong>To make the compote:</strong> Quarter, peel, and core the pears. Cut them into ½&gt;- to 1-inch/1.25- to 2.5-cm pieces of roughly equal size. Squirt with lemon juice to keep them from turning brown. In a large saucepan, dissolve the sugar in ½&gt; cup/120 ml water and bring to a boil. Add the pears and cinnamon and pour in the wine. When the liquid returns to a boil, lower the heat and gently boil, stirring frequently, until the pears are very tender but still holding their shape and the syrup has thickened, about 20 minutes. Add some water if it threatens to dry out. Remove from the heat and let cool.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">7.</span> Serve with the pear compote and blue cheese sauce to spoon over the pork as desired.</p>
