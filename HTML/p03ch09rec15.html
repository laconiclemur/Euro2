<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">In some Spanish recipes for quail with grapes, the birds are cooked in grape juice rather than wine; the juice is made by mashing grapes in the blender and then pressing the juice through a strainer or colander with small holes. In others, the grapes are caramelized in sugar syrup that is allowed to brown. I particularly like this old Galician version adapted from a recipe sent to me by Pepe Iglesias. It was once made with lard, but now butter is used in this part of Spain, which is dairy country, and cream makes a luscious sauce. Albariño grapes are used in Galicia, but you can use any flavorful seedless white grapes. You will need to pick up the birds with your fingers when you eat, so provide finger bowls for your guests, as well as paper napkins.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4 AS A MAIN COURSE; 8 AS A STARTER</span></p>
<p class="qun">4 tablespoons (½ stick) butter</p>
<p class="qun">3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">8 quail</p>
<p class="qun">1 pound seedless white grapes, stemmed</p>
<p class="qun">⅔ cup dry white wine</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup heavy cream</p>
<p class="qun1">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="recsum">Heat the butter and oil in a large skillet. Put in the quail and cook over medium heat, turning them occasionally, for about 8 minutes, until lightly browned all over.</p>
<p class="summary">Add the grapes, wine, and cream and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then simmer, covered, over low heat for about 15 minutes, turning the birds, so that all parts bathe in the sauce, or until the grapes are soft and the birds are done. To test them, cut between the leg and the body of one quail with a pointed knife: the juices must run clear but the flesh should still be slightly pink.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATION</span></p>
<p class="recsum">For a version from Mediterranean Spain, use Moscatel grapes and a half-and-half mix of sweet Moscatel wine and chicken stock. Omit the cream.</p>
