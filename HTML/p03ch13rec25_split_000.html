<p class="summary1">Pepe Iglesias (see page 328) says there are seventeen varieties of indigenous apples in Asturias, ranging from sweet and semi-sweet to tart and slightly bitter, many of them used for making cider. Their Reineta apples, which seem to be one of the oldest apples around, are used for baking and cooking. According to the British National Fruit Collection, there are at least fifteen different types of Reinettes, most of them in France (the French say there are dozens), but none in Britain and possibly none in America—although there is one type in Canada. I remember eating baked Reinettes and pastries made with them when I was at school in Paris. The smaller children played a game with their fists and sang, <span class="italic">“Pomme de Reinette et pomme d’Api, tapis, tapis rouge; pomme de Reinette et pomme d’Api, tapis, tapis gris.”</span> The Spanish baking Reineta is juicy with a good sweet flavor. When I asked people in Asturias and elsewhere in northern Spain what apples we could substitute, they all said Golden Delicious—how ordinary can you get!</p>
