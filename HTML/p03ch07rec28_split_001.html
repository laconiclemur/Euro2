<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">Spanish terms for mushrooms can be a bit confusing. All mushrooms are</span> hongos, <span class="italic">but wild ones are referred to as</span> setas, <span class="italic">and cultivated button mushrooms as</span> champiñones. <span class="italic">The easiest mushrooms to cultivate and the most common are the</span> champiñones de Paris, <span class="italic">so called because they were first cultivated near Paris in Napoleon’s time (these are our ordinary white button mushrooms). They are highly regarded in Spain. As they do not have the rich flavor and aroma of wild funghi, this way of preparing them, with plenty of garlic, a rich extra virgin olive oil, and a little lemon juice, or wine if you like, suits them well. They are a popular</span> <span class="italic">tapa</span> <span class="italic">all over Spain, served with crusty bread to mop up the garlicky oil.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4</span></p>
<p class="qun">½ pound button mushrooms</p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">4 to 5 garlic cloves, chopped or sliced</p>
<p class="qun">½ teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice or ¼ cup dry white wine (optional)</p>
<p class="qun1">2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley</p>
<p class="recsum">Wipe any dirt off the mushrooms. If necessary, trim the stems and rinse them briefly under cold water. Cut them in half, or into quarters if they are large.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Heat the oil in a large skillet. Add the mushrooms, garlic, and red pepper flakes, if using, and sauté over medium-high heat, stirring and turning the mushrooms and adding salt and pepper, until they absorb the oil and then release it and their juices. Add the lemon juice or white wine, if using, lower the heat, and cook until the mushrooms are very soft and the juices have almost evaporated, so that the oil is sizzling. In all, the cooking may take about 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Stir in the parsley and serve hot or at room temperature.</p>
