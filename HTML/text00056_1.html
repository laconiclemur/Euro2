 TOMATO &amp; CUCUMBER GAZPACHO</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_blue" id="nad0003023">
<em>Gazpacho is a delicious ‘no cook’ soup made with raw vegetables, blitzed up. It’s traditionally served cold, in particular during hot summers in Spain and Portugal. That’s exactly how I like to eat it too, so during that one week of summer we usually get here in the UK, I will always find an opportunity to make it! It’s quick, simple, easy and adaptable. Best of all, it can be made in advance, stored in the fridge, and no cooking is necessary. Which also makes it perfect for lunches on the go.</em>

<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 For the garlic you will need a blowtorch or a gas hob. If you don’t have either, you can just miss this step out and put the garlic into the bowl peeled and whole.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003038">
<span class="blue">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Burn the garlic over a gas flame on the hob, until the outer skin is totally black. You can do the same thing by placing the garlic on a baking tray and using a blowtorch to burn the skin. Put the burnt garlic skin and garlic cloves into a large bowl. This process gives the whole dish a smoky taste.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003039">
<span class="blue">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Add the cucumber, red peppers, cornichons, tomatoes, red onion, bread and dried tarragon. Season, and give everything a good mix to combine well. Add the vinegar and oil and mix well, using your hands and making sure to give it all a squeeze.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003040">
<span class="blue">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Cover and leave in the fridge for 4 hours, or overnight if you have time.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003041">
<span class="blue">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Spoon everything into a regular blender and blitz to a smooth paste. You can use a stick blender, if you have one. If the mixture is too thick, add some olive oil and blitz till you get a runnier consistency.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003042">
<span class="blue">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Check the seasoning, then drizzle with a little olive oil and serve with some fresh tarragon sprinkled on top.</p>
