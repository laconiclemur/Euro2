<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Typically prepared in homes across Menorca, these have also become a favorite bar tapa in the island’s market towns, Alaior, Es Mercadal, Ferreries, and Es Migjorn Gran. Some Menorcan cooks add a soft, spreadable pork sausage called sobrassada to the ground meat mixture. The paprika-flavored sobrassada adds a perfect contrast to the sweet tomato sauce. (<a href="261-source.html#page_345"><span class="red">See Sources, page 345</span></a>, for where to find sobrassada.) I learned in Menorca to moisten my hands with white wine before rolling the meatballs. It makes the process easier and slightly perfumes the meatballs.</span></strong></p>

</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> In a bowl, blend the beef, pork, sobrassada, egg, and 1 of the garlic cloves. Season with salt and pepper. Add the breadcrumbs and work into a smooth paste. Moisten your hands with wine and roll the mixture into 1-inch-/2.5-cm-diameter meatballs with about 1-tablespoon portions. There should be 28 to 32 of them.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a cazuela, heavy casserole, large sauté pan, or deep skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat and cook the meatballs in single-layer batches, turning frequently, until browned on the outside, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a platter and cover to keep warm.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> In the cazuela over medium heat, prepare a sofrito with the tomatoes, onion, and remaining garlic clove, following the directions on <a href="25-boxnote05.html#page_39">page 39</a>. Stir in the sugar and season with salt.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Return the meatballs to the pan. Add the wine, pine nuts, thyme, bay leaf, and 1 cup/240 ml water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer uncovered for 20 to 30 minutes, turning the meatballs and swirling the pan from time to time to keep them from sticking. Add in a bit more water if needed to keep the tomato sauce loose. Serve from the cazuela.</p>
