<p class="author1"><span class="txit">insalata di barbabietole rosse</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">In the summer and fall my father’s family prepared this salad with beets from their garden. In the winter they would substitute canned whole beets. Fresh beets may be cooked one day ahead of time. Leave whole, cover, and store in the refrigerator. Return to room temperature before slicing, dressing, and serving. I serve this salad as part of a summer buffet.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">6 medium-size beets, tops removed</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano leaves or <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> teaspoon dried</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 clove garlic, chopped</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">Trim each beet to remove any roots and the tougher skin on the top and bottom. Place in a pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil and cook until the beets are tender when pierced with a knife, about 20 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool slightly. Peel the beets while they are still warm to the touch, and cut into <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub>-inch-thick slices. Toss with the oregano, vinegar, garlic, and olive oil. Serve at room temperature.</p>
