<p class="author1"><span class="txit">carciofini e rucola con parmigiano</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This is Gianni’s twist on a traditional Roman recipe. Use tender artichokes, about 2<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> inches tall, shaved very thin, <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">8</sub> inch or less. Then add the arugula and Parmesan cheese to accent the flavor of the artichokes. Use a vegetable peeler to create large, thin shavings of Parmesan to garnish the salad.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 lemon</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">10 baby artichokes (about 1 pound)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon finely grated Parmesan cheese</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice (from about 1 lemon)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">3</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> pound arugula, stemmed</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">16 large shavings Parmesan cheese (about 2 ounces)</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Fill a large bowl with cold water. Cut the lemon in half and squeeze the juice into the water. Place the lemon halves in the water and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Cut away and discard the artichoke stems. Peel off and discard several layers of the tough outer leaves until you reach a layer where the artichoke leaves are half pale green and half pale yellow. Trim off the top pale green portion of the artichokes and discard. Slice the artichokes in half lengthwise, and remove any of the fine choke from the center. Place in the lemon water, rubbing each half with a bit of the lemon, and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> In a large bowl, whisk the grated cheese, lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Remove the artichokes from the water and pat dry. Slice the artichokes lengthwise into very thin strips—<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">8</sub> inch or less—and add the slices to the bowl with the dressing. Toss to coat evenly with the dressing and set aside for at least 15 minutes or for up to 2 hours.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_45"/><span class="red">5.</span> In a large bowl, whisk the vinegar with salt and pepper to taste. Whisk in the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil. Add the arugula and toss to evenly coat with this dressing. Distribute evenly among four salad plates. Top the arugula with equal portions of artichokes. Garnish each portion with 4 long strips of Parmesan cheese just before serving.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATION</span>:</span> Celery root or jicama may be used in place of the artichokes. Peel the celery root or jicama, then cut into julienne strips using a food processor or knife. Toss with the dressing and proceed with the basic recipe. One quarter teaspoon red pepper flakes or <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> fresh jalapeño pepper, seeded and finely chopped, may be added to the celery root or jicama just before tossing with the dressing.</p>
