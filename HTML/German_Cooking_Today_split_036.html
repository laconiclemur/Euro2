</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Meat must be prepared when it is as fresh as possible because its high protein and water content make it highly perishable. When using meat which has not been minced, you must first rinse it under cold running water, pat it dry and then prepare it according to the recipe. Otherwise put the pieces of meat in a china or stainless steel container, cover (for instance with a lid, a plate or clingfilm) and store in the fridge until you use it. In this case you should only rinse the meat just before you are about to prepare it. Coat small amounts of meat with oil before storing in the fridge. This will prevent the meat from drying out and will also make it more tender.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> If you do not need to use the meat immediately, you can wrap it up and freeze it. To use the frozen meat, leave it to defrost covered in the fridge and immediately pour away any water resulting from the thawing (because of the danger of salmonella). Once thawed, the meat must be prepared immediately. Never freeze it a second time.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> When buying pre-packaged meat, check the best-before date and the recommended storage temperature indicated on the package.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Coating in breadcrumbs</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Anything coated in breadcrumbs is protected by its coating from drying out during the frying process. In addition, the breadcrumbs create a delicious, tasty crust. Coating in breadcrumbs is particularly suitable for individual portions such as schnitzels and chops.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> To coat in breadcrumbs: Prepare three shallow bowls. Put flour in the first one, one or more eggs (depending on the amount of meat to be coated) whisked with a fork in the second one, and breadcrumbs in the third one. Rinse the pieces of meat and dab them dry in the flour. Then turn each one over in the egg and press it lightly in the breadcrumbs. Shake off any excess breadcrumbs because they would burn during the frying process. Fry the breadcrumb-coated meat immediately to prevent the coating from becoming soggy. You can also add grated cheese to the breadcrumbs. Or alternatively coat the meat in sesame seeds, grated coconut, crushed corn flakes or finely chopped nut kernels, almonds or sunflower seeds.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Cooking methods</span></span></span></p><ul class="calibre17"><li value="1" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Frying</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Frying means cooking and browning in shallow fat. This method of cooking can be used for cooking individual portions such as schnitzels, chops and steaks. The meat can be fried uncoated in its natural state, or coated in flour or in breadcrumbs. </span><ul class="calibre19"><li value="1" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Heat the fat (edible oil, clarified butter or vegetable fat) in a frying pan.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Put the seasoned meat (which has first been rinsed in cold running water and then patted dry) in the hot oil or fat so that the pores close up quickly and the meat remains tender.</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Fry the meat until golden brown and crisp on one side.</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Only turn the meat when it comes easily off the bottom of the pan.</span></li><li value="5" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Fry the meat until it is golden brown on both sides.</span></li><li value="6" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Only salt the meat and add the onions after frying because they draw out water.</span></li><li value="7" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Take the meat you have just fried out of the pan and briefly drain it on kitchen paper in order to remove excess fat. Serve immediately or cover and keep in a warm place.</span></li><li value="8" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">To make the sauce: Loosen the cooking deposits with a little liquid, such as water, stock, wine or whipping cream, and deglaze. If desired, thicken it with a roux, starch or gravy thickener, for instance.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul class="calibre17"><li value="1" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Roasting in the oven</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> When roasting in the oven, the meat is cooked and browned in the oven in an uncovered container with or without the addition of fat. This cooking method is particularly suitable for larger pieces of meat such as roasts and poultry. </span><ul class="calibre19"><li value="1" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Preheat the oven to the temperature indicated in the recipe.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Put the drip pan in the oven on the bottom shelf and, if desired, add a little water.</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Place the prepared, seasoned roast in the drip pan or on a roasting grid over the drip pan.</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">When the roasting juices begin to brown and thicken, and any liquid added has evaporated, add more liquid, preferably hot.</span></li><li value="5" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">During the roasting process, baste the meat with the cooking juices from time to time.</span></li><li value="6" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Another method consists of browning the meat in hot oil in a casserole on top of the cooker. The roast is then transferred to the oven to complete the roasting process. Here, too, it is important to replace the liquid which has evaporated and baste the roast with the cooking juices from time to time.</span></li></ul></li></ul><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Earthenware cooking pots or cooking bricks are also ideally suited for roasting in the oven. Put the meat in the earthenware container which has been previously soaked in water, cover with the lid, then put it in the cold oven (please follow the manufacturer’s instructions). You can also cook roasts in the oven in roasting bags or in foil (again, follow the manufacturer’s instructions).</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">In order to ensure that the meat remains tender, you can use the low-temperature cooking method, using a meat thermometer to maintain the correct temperature. Brown the meat to be roasted in a casserole on top of the cooker, then cook it uncovered in a very cool oven, preheated to 80 °C/ 180 °F, or 70 °C/160 °F in a fan oven, for about 4 hours. There is no need to baste with this method. When using this cooking method it is important that the temperature remains absolutely constant. This is why it is essential to use a meat thermometer. At the end of the cooking time the temperature in the centre of the meat should be at least 60 °C/140 °F. This method is only suitable for beef and lamb roasts. Other kinds of meat need a higher temperature.</span></p><ul class="calibre17"><li value="1" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Braising</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Braising consists first in browning the meat in hot fat, then simmering it in very little liquid and steam. Braised dishes can be cooked either on top of the cooker or in the oven in a well-sealed casserole. </span><ul class="calibre19"><li value="1" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Rinse the meat under cold water, pat dry and season. Then brown the meat in hot oil.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Add the onions, green vegetables (if any) and fry.</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Add some hot liquid (for instance, water, stock or wine). The liquid should only cover one quarter of the meat at the most.</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Reduce the temperature, cover and braise on top of the cooker or braise in the preheated oven.</span></li><li value="5" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Add liquid regularly to replace what has evaporated.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul class="calibre17"><li value="1" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Cooking (boiling)</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Boiling means cooking meat (for instance, boiled beef) in a large quantity of boiling liquid (water or stock, sometimes mixed with vinegar or wine). </span><ul class="calibre19"><li value="1" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Bring sufficient liquid to the boil (with green vegetables if the recipe requires it) in a pan to cover the meat completely or almost completely.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Rinse the meat under cold water and put the meat in the boiling liquid. The pores of the meat will close immediately so that very little meat juice will be exuded, thus ensuring that the meat remains tender.</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Cook the meat with the lid on so that the temperature remains constant at a simmering point. This means that the liquid should barely bubble.</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">The remaining cooking liquid can be used in another dish or frozen for later use.</span></li></ul></li></ul><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Testing the cooking</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> There are several ways to test whether the meat is properly cooked. For instance, you can use a meat thermometer, available in hardware shops or any shop selling household goods, to check the internal temperature. Another way is to judge from the colour of the juice produced when cutting the meat: when the meat is sufficiently cooked, the meat juices run clear and no longer pink or red. You can also check whether meat is cooked by pressing a spoon onto the meat:</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> soft: the meat is still red inside (the spoon sinks in easily)</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> springy: the meat is pink inside (the spoon sinks in a little)</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> firm: the meat is cooked through (the spoon does not sink in).</span></p><ul class="calibre17"><li value="1" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Carving the meat </span><ul class="calibre19"><li value="1" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Large pieces of meat such as roasts, and also steaks, should be covered with a large bowl or wrapped in aluminium foil and left to rest for at least 10 minutes before being carved so that the meat juices are distributed throughout the meat.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">Always cut the meat across the fibres. Reserve any meat juices which may be produced while the meat is resting and being carved, and use to make the gravy.</span></li></ul></li></ul><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Beef</span></span></span></p><ul class="calibre17"><li value="1" class="calibre25"><span class="calibre6">Depending on the age of the animal, we distinguish between: </span><ul class="calibre19"><li value="1" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">calves (male and female animals not fully grown, up to about 12 months old).</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">heifers (15 months to 2 years old)</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">oxen (2 to 3 years old).</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">cows and bulls (2 years up to over 5 years old)</span></li></ul><span class="calibre6"> The meat produced by young animals is bright light red or brick red in colour with small white to light yellow streaks of fat. The cut surface is shiny and the texture is fine to mediumfine. The meat of older animals is dark reddish-brown in colour with yellowish fatty streaks and a coarser texture. Beef must be well hung. Hanging means that the bled meat of the freshly slaughtered animal is hung in a well-ventilated room at a temperature of between 1–3 °C/ 34–37 °F for a period ranging from a few days to a few weeks, depending on the cut of meat and its purpose, to tenderize the meat. But poultry should never be hung because it goes off very quickly.</span></li></ul><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Suitable cuts for roasting are:</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Sirloin, fillet, rib roast, topside, silverside, top rump, thick flank and rump roast.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Suitable cuts for braising are:</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Topside, rump ox, rolled ribs, rump roast, shoulder-tip and shoulder.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Suitable cuts for frying and grilling are:</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Slices cut from the rib (entrecôte steak), sirloin steak, rump steak, fillet steak (châteaubriand), thick flank, rump roast and liver.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Suitable cuts for boiling are:</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Chine, neck, breast, ribs, flat or rolled ribs, shoulder, flank, knuckle and tail, lungs, heart, tongue, kidneys.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Cuts of beef</span></span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6">

</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Minced meat can be made from any kind of meat. However, minced meat sold in shops is made from beef, pork and lamb, and not from game and poultry. The percentage of fat in mince varies. Mince must be carefully prepared and stored because its considerably increased surface area provides an ideal breeding ground for micro-organisms, so it can go bad very quickly. For this reason it should be processed as quickly as possible after it has been bought.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Types of mince</span></span></span><span class="calibre6">

Offal is usually low in fat and rich in protein, vitamins and minerals, but it is also high in cholesterol and uric acid. Some kinds of offal are considered delicacies in many countries. But because they can suffer heavy metal pollution (especially the liver and the kidneys), they should not be consumed too often, at most once a month. When buying offal make sure that it comes from young animals because it will be more tender and less polluted.</span></p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_36"></div>
