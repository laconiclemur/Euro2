<h2 class="h2b">COEUR A LA CREME</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Cheese Heart with Berries</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>I first encountered this combination at breakfast with wild strawberries, but it would make an elegant dessert. Without making and draining the heart you could have an equally delicious time with a whopping spoonful of the sweetened fresh creamy cheese, double cream and the berries just slightly warmed</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
350g (12oz) fromage frais<br/>
200g (7oz) caster sugar<br/>
Juice of 1 lemon<br/>
250g (9oz) raspberries<br/>
300g (10½ oz) or 2 large punnets, of either raspberries, strawberries or redcurrants, or a mixture<br/>
100ml (3½ fl oz) double cream or crème fraîche (optional)</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Line a heart, or any perforated mould – the base of a small colander would do – with a layer of muslin. Mix the fresh cheese with half the sugar and the lemon juice and spoon it into the muslin and mould, being careful not to crease the muslin too much. Tap the mould against the table a few times to knock out any air bubbles and leave to drain for at least 2 hours.</p>
<p class="normala">Mix the first 250g (9oz) raspberries with the remaining sugar and 100ml (3½ fl oz) water in a small pan. Bring to the boil, purée and strain, and mix with the remaining fruit.</p>
<p class="normala">To serve, unmould the cheese heart, warm the berries in the coulis and help yourselves to the double cream.</p>
