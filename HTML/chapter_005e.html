<h2 class="h2b">CREME DE NOIX</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Walnut Creams</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>When I first learned to make this in my second year of working in France, we were made to soak the walnut kernels in warm milk, then peel them. As the token foreigner, this was one of my jobs and it actually does produce something wonderful, if a little over the top. But when possible, make these creams in autumn with the new season walnuts which are much sweeter than those that have been sitting about, and more creamy</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
8 egg yolks<br/>
150g (5½ oz) caster sugar<br/>
100g (3½ oz) fresh shelled walnuts, coarsely chopped<br/>
700ml (1¼ pint) whipping cream<br/>
1 vanilla pod</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Prepare a bowl over a larger bowl of iced water. Whisk the egg yolks together with half of the sugar. Put the remaining sugar and the walnuts into a small pan and heat to melt the sugar. Simmer until the caramel turns a pale gold colour. Add 400ml (14fl oz) of the cream, but be careful as it may spit. Don’t worry if the caramel hardens, it will go soft again with the heat. Bring to the boil then whisk very slowly into the egg/sugar mixture. Return to a medium heat and stir until it coats the back of a spoon and you can run a line through it. Transfer to the bowl and let the custard cool completely.</p>
<p class="normala">Split and scrape the vanilla pod and add the seeds to the remaining cream. Whisk it to firm. Fold this into the cooled custard and put into small dishes. Serve very cold.</p>
