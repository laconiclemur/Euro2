<p class="author"><span class="txit">pasta</span></p>
<p class="noindenti"><span class="stickup">A</span>s for most Italians, pasta is a staple in our family’s daily life. We eat it all the time, primarily as a first course. It is one of the simplest yet most complex and varied foodstuffs ever. Each time you make it, you are presented with a blank canvas that can be given so many shapes, sizes, and textures, and that is enhanced by each sauce accompanying it.</p>
<p class="indenti">In Italy, every region has its own array of pasta shapes that are served with a variety of stuffings and sauces. Some pasta names vary from region to region—<span class="txit">strozzapreti,</span> for example, or “priest stranglers,” are called <span class="txit">strangolapreti</span> in some towns. In the north, they are strands of pasta the width of fettuccine twisted into a coil; in the south, they are big ricotta dumplings. Other shapes of pasta, such as <span class="txit">garganelli</span> or <span class="txit">maccheroni,</span> have the same name all over Italy but the size of the noodles varies from region to region.</p>
<p class="indenti">The traditional pasta recipes that follow are some of the finest I’ve eaten. Most are simple to prepare, calling for ingredients that I usually keep in the pantry, such as canned tomatoes, canned tuna, beans, capers, and olives. The portions are modest, with a pound of pasta serving as many as six people. Try them and let them be an inspiration to create your own versions.</p>
