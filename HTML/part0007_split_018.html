			<p class="rec-intro">When Le Gavroche and The Waterside Inn first opened, salads were always offered as side dishes with all main courses, never as a starter. On some of the earlier menus salade du jour also featured and most were as elaborate as this recipe.</p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 6</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">200g Belgian endive </p>

			<p class="body">Cut the endive into manageable bite-sized strips. Remove the leaves from the celery and set them aside for garnishing the salad, then cut the celery heart into strips about the same size as the endive. Put the endive and celery in iced water for 20 minutes to firm up, then drain well. </p>
			<p class="body">Peel the apples and cut them into matchsticks, then put them into a little water and lemon juice to keep them white. </p>
			<p class="body">Mix the mayonnaise with the crème fraiche in a serving bowl and season with salt and pepper and the remaining lemon juice. </p>
			<p class="body">Put the endive, celery and apple sticks in a bowl and garnish with thin shavings of truffle. Serve with the mayonnaise and crème fraiche sauce to spoon over. </p>
