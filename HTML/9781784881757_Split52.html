<h1 class="chapter">a herbed dish</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>‘From all flowers and other herbs aforementioned, whatever kind you like, you can make a herbed dish (<i>erbolato</i>) with cheese and eggs and spices, and it should be cooked in the oven or between baking pans.’ This passage is from the medieval cookbook by the Anonimo Toscano, an anonymous Tuscan chef who wrote down his collection of recipes in the 1300s. An <i>erbolato</i> is a sort of medieval frittata made from seasonal herbs. His recipe works just as well for a brunch or lunch today.</b></p>
