<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">The farmhouse we’ve rented in Menorca for the summer has a row of fig trees planted above one of the long rockeries. There are a couple of different varieties, including the most appreciated local one called <em>figaflor</em>. In August, when the trees overlap in their ripening, and their flowing abundance offers more figs than we can eat fresh, I begin preserving them in marmalade to take back to Barcelona. But I also save plenty to prepare for dinner guests in a local way—baking the figs for a sweet, juicy dessert called, in the local dialects of the Balearic Islands, <em>figues al forn</em>. Serve with a small fork and knife but also a spoon in order to get all of their lovely juices. They are delicious with natural yogurt, fresh whipped cream, or even vanilla ice cream.</span></strong></p>

<li>12 FRESH FIGS, ABOUT 1 POUND/455 G TOTAL</li>
<li>½&gt; SMALL RIPE LEMON</li>

</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C/gas mark 4.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a small saucepan, bring ½&gt; cup/120 ml water and the sugar to a boil while stirring to dissolve the sugar. Remove the pan from the heat.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Gently rinse the figs and trim the stems flush to where the fruit begins to curve outward. In a baking dish, set the figs upright. Squeeze the lemon and dribble the sugar water over the top.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Bake for 15 minutes. Sprinkle the wine over top of the figs and bake for another 15 minutes, or until the figs are tender and succulent. Watch that the tops do not burn.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Remove from the oven and let cool. Divide the figs among dessert plates. Spoon the burgundy-hued syrup from the baking dish over the top. Serve at room temperature, or cover and refrigerate until slightly chilled.</p>
