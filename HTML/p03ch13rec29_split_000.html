<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">There is a big tradition of making sponge cake in Spain, and it is often eaten dipped or soaked in sweet wine. Here layers of ladyfingers soaked in sweet wine alternate with layers of apple puree. You can use sweet hard cider instead of wine.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6 TO 8</span></p>
<p class="qun">2 pounds Golden Delicious or other sweet apples</p>
<p class="qun">Juice of ½ lemon</p>
<p class="qun">About 2¼ cups sweet white wine, such as Moscatel</p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup sugar or to taste</p>
<p class="qun1">A package of ladyfingers (<span class="italic">boudoirs</span>; about 6 ounces)</p>
<p class="recsum">Peel, quarter, and core the apples, putting them as you go into a large bowl of water acidulated with the lemon juice to prevent them from discoloring.</p>
<p class="summary">Drain the apples, put them in a saucepan with ½ cup of the white wine, and cook, covered, over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, until the apples are soft. Mash the apples with a potato masher, add sugar to taste, and continue to cook, uncovered, stirring often, over medium to high heat for 15 to 20 minutes, until all the liquid has evaporated (the bottom of the pan should look dry). Let cool.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Pour the remaining wine into a wide soup plate. Line a 9- to 10-inch round mold or cake pan with plastic wrap so that it overhangs generously all the way around the edges. Spread half the apple puree in the bottom.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Moisten the ladyfingers in the sweet wine, a few at a time, leaving them in for seconds only (if they absorb too much wine, they will become soggy and fall apart). Arrange a layer of ladyfingers on top of the apple puree, trimming them to fit. Cover with the remaining apple puree and a second layer of ladyfingers dampened in sweet wine.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Cover with the overhanging plastic wrap and another piece of wrap. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours, or overnight.</p>
<p class="recsum1">To serve, remove the plastic wrap from the top, turn the pudding out onto a platter, and remove the second piece of plastic wrap.</p>
