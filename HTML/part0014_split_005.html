  <h3 class="h3a">Baked pears with amaretti biscuits and almonds</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">Italians love pears and in the autumn they often slow-cook the fruit, either on the hob or in the oven. This recipe is very simple to prepare; as the pears bake, their juices mix with the wine, cloves and lemon to produce a really delicious ‘sauce’. The addition of almonds and amaretti biscuits give a nice crunchy texture. Serve the pears just as they are or with mascarpone cream, whipped cream or good vanilla ice cream.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 large pears, such as Williams or Conference</p>

  <p class="ing1">175ml/6fl oz/¾ cup white wine</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 cloves</p>

  <p class="ing1">50g/1¾oz/¼ cup caster (superfine) sugar</p>

  <p class="ing1">grated zest and juice of ½ unwaxed lemon</p>

  <p class="ing1">30g/1oz/¼ cup flaked (slivered) almonds, crushed</p>

  <p class="ing1">30g/1oz amaretti biscuits, crushed</p>

  <p class="ing1">½ tsp ground cinnamon</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 tbsp Marsala wine</p>

  <p class="ing2">30g/1oz/2 tbsp butter, divided into eight pieces</p>

  <p class="para">Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas mark 4.</p>

  <p class="para">Slice the pears in half lengthways and remove the pips, scooping out a little of the flesh. Set aside.</p>

  <p class="para">Combine the wine, cloves, sugar, lemon zest and juice in an ovenproof dish. Add the pear halves, cover with foil and bake for 1 hour, until the pears are cooked through.</p>

  <p class="para">Meanwhile, combine the crushed almonds, amaretti and cinnamon.</p>

  <p class="para">Remove the pears from the oven. Add the Marsala to the liquid. Fill the pears with the almond mixture, top each with a piece of butter, cover with foil and return to the oven. After 20 minutes, remove the foil and return to the oven for 10 minutes.</p>

  <p class="para1">Leave to cool slightly before serving. Serve with the juice drizzled over the top and some mascarpone cream or ice cream if desired.</p>
