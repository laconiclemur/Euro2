<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">W</span><small>E DEFINITELY HAD</small> a wide variety of foods in our house growing up. My sister wasn’t an adventurous eater at all, but I was always up for trying something new and different.</p>
<p class="indent">My mother’s dietary choices meant we ate a lot of Mediterranean foods, because they were vegetarian-friendly cuisines. However, I also grew up eating lamb because it was typically the only red meat my mom brought into the house. Whenever we’d say to her, “Ma, you’re a vegetarian—how can you eat red meat?” she’d say, “It’s not red meat, it’s lamb.” I also remember eating curried goat as a kid.</p>
<p class="indent">They may not qualify as vegetarian, exactly, but preparing lamb and goat at home is really easy, and these meats are so full of flavor. As with many ingredients, getting to know the meat purveyors at your local farmers’ market is a great way to find really fresh lamb and goat.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>In Greece, you can buy this fermented couscous—trahana—in specialty stores, but I learned how to make my own, and I’ve been doing it ever since. It’s a little sweet, a little sour, but hearty all the way around. Serving it with braised leg of lamb is a holiday tradition. If you don’t have time to make your own, you can make this dish with regular couscous. I hope you’ll try making the fermented couscous at least once, though. It’s really easy to do and tastes so much better.</i></p>

<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>1.</b></span> Preheat the oven to 325°F.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>2.</b></span> Using a meat cleaver, cut the leg of lamb at the joint into two pieces and season with salt and pepper. Heat the canola oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot (oven safe) over medium-high heat. Sear the lamb for 2 minutes on every side until golden brown. Remove the lamb from the pot and let it rest on a cutting board.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>3.</b></span> Lower the heat to medium and sauté onions and garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the garlic is golden.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>4.</b></span> Stir in the tomato paste and sauté for 1 minute. Add the crushed tomatoes and sauté for 5 minutes, stirring often. Add the chicken broth, thyme, and bay leaf. Bring the mixture to a low boil and add the lamb. Cover with a lid and braise in the oven for 4 hours, turning the meat every hour. When done, the meat should be falling off the bone.</p>

Stir the fermented couscous and lemon juice into the braising liquid, and cook on the stovetop over medium heat for 5 minutes. The couscous will absorb some of the liquid, but not all of it. That’s okay—a thick, soupy consistency is what you want.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>7.</b></span> Break the lamb into big pieces, discarding the fatty parts. Transfer the couscous to a large serving dish, top with lamb, and serve.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Slow roasting meat means less moisture is lost, resulting in a more tender dish. Here, the meat will not be falling off the bone, and it will be similar in feel to sliced roast beef. Make sure you have a working meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the lamb as it cooks.</i></p>
