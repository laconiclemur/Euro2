<h1 class="chapter"><a id="page_40"/>homemade tomato sauce</h1>
<p class="tx1"><b>This is the tomato sauce that is essential to the Italian kitchen. A large jar or plastic box of it will be found in most Italian fridges. It is used on pasta, to give body to a casserole, to make <a href="9781784881757_Split37.html#page_59a">Babbo’s Eggs</a>, or to pep up a soup (I often purée it and serve it as a soup in itself). Don’t skimp on the oil: if you don’t use a generous amount you cannot cook the onions for long enough to get the sweetness out of them that balances the acidity of the tomatoes, and they would burn at the edges instead of sweating slowly and becoming translucent. Use an Italian brand of plum tomatoes - they usually taste better than from anywhere else - and always buy whole tomatoes instead of chopped, which can be watery. This sauce doesn’t freeze brilliantly due to the water content but it will last up to five days in the fridge.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 4–6 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang">6 tablespoons extra-virgin</p>
<p class="hang">olive oil</p>
<p class="hang">1 small red onion, peeled and finely chopped</p>
<p class="hang">2 garlic cloves, peeled and lightly crushed</p>
<p class="hang">1 teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="hang">freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hang">2 × 400 g (14 oz) tins plum tomatoes (or 1 quantity passata - see opposite)</p>
<p class="tx2">Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over a medium heat. Add the chopped onions and garlic, then season with salt and pepper. Cook for 5–7 minutes, stirring, until the onion has softened. Add the tomatoes and crush them in the pan with a potato masher to break them up. Rinse each tin out with a ¼ tin of cold water and add this to the saucepan. Simmer over a low heat, uncovered, for about 40 minutes. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning as necessary.</p>
