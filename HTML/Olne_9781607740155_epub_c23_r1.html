  <h2 class="section sgc-1" id="heading_id_2"><a id="page328"></a>THE GARDEN PEAS A LA FRANCAISE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Most often, peas <em>à la française</em> are prepared with a <em>chiffonade</em> of lettuce mixed in and with a certain amount of water added. Although the flavor of the lettuce braised with the peas enhances them, serving the lettuce with the peas detracts from their rare delicacy (the onions and lettuce will make a valuable addition to a soup). In as much as the cooking liquid should be very sparse, and because with this method of cooking there is practically no evaporation, the water contained in the vegetables themselves, plus the humidity of the freshly washed lettuce, is largely sufficient.</p>

  <p class="indent">The quantity of peas recommended for 4 people may seem overgenerous, but in order for the dish to be prepared to perfection, all the peas must be tiny, tender, and of nearly the same size. A batch of peas picked at the same time, all the pods of which are similar in appearance, never displays an altogether uniform maturity, once shelled, and the larger and harder peas should be put aside for another use (in purées and soups, they are superior to the tiny ones because of their greater starchy “binding” content). The length of cooking time may also seem surprising, but it should be remembered that their cooking is mainly a gentle steaming and that they are not even uniformly heated through until a good 15 minutes after they have been put to cook—the same tiny peas, plunged into rapidly boiling water, would require only about 5 minutes.</p>

  <p class="indent">It is absolutely essential that the receptacle in which they are cooked be of a heavy material that takes the heat slowly and evenly (earthenware, heavy copper or enameled cast-iron ware), that it be of a size to just hold the ingredients, and that it have a tight-fitting lid.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c23-s86"><em><span class="color">Garden Peas à la Française</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Petits Pois à la Française</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 medium head Boston-type lettuce</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 large pinch thyme (or a couple of branches)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><a id="page329"></a><em>7 or 8 little new onions</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ pound (1 stick) softened butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, pinch of sugar, freshly ground white pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3½–4 pounds tender garden peas, picked the day to be used, if possible</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Remove the outer leaves from the lettuce, keeping the heart intact, wash the leaves and the heart, and line the bottom and sides of the saucepan with lettuce leaves. Carefully open out the leaves of the heart, imprison the thyme within, close them up again, tie the heart well with thread, and place it in the center of the saucepan, with the little onions, peeled but whole, all around.</p>

  <p class="indent">Mash the softened butter together with the salt, sugar and pepper, and very gently, with your hands, mix in the peas, being careful to crush none. When they are all uniformly coated with this <em>pommade,</em> pack them lightly all around the lettuce heart, cover with more lettuce leaves, fit the lid tightly, and start them out over a high flame for something less than a minute—just long enough for the saucepan to absorb a bit of heat—and leave them to cook over a tiny flame, gently shaking the saucepan from time to time, for 40–45 minutes. After ½ hour, lift off the lid briefly to check their progress.</p>

  <p class="indent">Remove the onions, the lettuce heart and all the leaves, and serve directly from the cooking utensil.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c23-s87"><em><span class="color">Blanquette of Veal</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Blanquette de Veau à l’Ancienne</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>6 ounces small, firm, unopened mushrooms</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>juice of ½ lemon</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ cup water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon (½ ounce) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 pounds breast or rib tips of veal (tendrons—the point at which the ribs become cartilaginous), cut into ¾-inch slices</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch lengths</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em><a id="page330"></a>2 medium onions, peeled, 1 stuck with 2 cloves</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>a large pinch of thyme or mixed herbs</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>a bouquet containing parsley, a small celery branch and 1 bay leaf</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about 20 small new onions</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 tablespoons (1 ounce) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>roux made with 1 tablespoon flour</em> (<em>mounded but not heaping</em>) <em>and</em> 2 <em>tablespoons</em> (<em>1 ounce</em>) <em>butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>⅓ cup heavy cream</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 egg yolks</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>freshly ground pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>pinch of freshly grated nutmeg</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>a few drops of lemon juice</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>chopped parsley</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Pare the stem tips of the mushrooms, wash them rapidly, and, if small enough, leave them whole (or cut them into halves or quarters, depending on their size). Combine them with the lemon juice, ¼ cup water, 1 tablespoon butter, and salt and pepper, and boil, covered, for 1 minute.</p>

  <p class="indent">Arrange the pieces of meat in a heavy saucepan so that, without packing them in, they take up a minimum of space, add the mushrooms’ cooking liquid (put the mushrooms aside), and enough cold water to cover the meat by about ⅓ inch, salt, bring to a boil, and skim 2 or 3 times, adding small amounts of cold water each time the liquid returns to a boil. Add the carrots, the two onions, the herbs, and the aromatic bouquet, making certain that all are submerged, and regulate the heat to maintain a bare simmer, the saucepan covered, for 1½ hours.</p>

  <p class="indent">During this time, the little onions should be seasoned and gently stewed, whole, in 2 tablespoons of butter, in a saucepan, the bottom of which just holds them side by side. Count about 15 minutes, keeping them covered and tossing them from time to time. They should be soft and slightly yellowed, but not browned.</p>

  <p class="indent">Pour the contents of the saucepan containing the meat into a large sieve placed over a mixing bowl. Pick out the 2 onions and the bouquet and discard them. Reserve the liquid. Return the meat and carrot pieces to their saucepan, add the mushrooms and the little onions, and put the pan aside, covered. Skim any fat from the surface of the liquid.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page331"></a>In another saucepan, make the <em>roux</em>: Melt 2 tablespoons butter over a low flame, add the flour, and leave to cook for a minute or so, stirring regularly, without allowing the flour to brown. Away from the flame, pour in the cooking liquid, slowly, stirring the while. Return to a medium flame, continue stirring until a boil is reached, lower the flame to maintain a simmer, the saucepan uncovered, and, over a period of about 20 minutes, skim the light, fatty skin that repeatedly forms on the surface. Pour this lightly thickened sauce back over the meat and its garnish and leave to simmer, covered, for about 15 minutes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Mix together in a bowl the cream, the egg yolks, the pepper and very little nutmeg, stir in, pouring slowly, a ladleful of the sauce, and then, away from the flame, stir this mixture into the stew. Return the saucepan to a medium-low flame, stirring constantly, until the sauce is only thick enough to lightly coat the spoon. It must not approach a boil or it will curdle. Squeeze in a few drops of lemon juice (not too much—taste and add more, if necessary), and pour the stew into a preheated deep serving platter. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve, accompanied by a <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#rh3">Pilaf</a>.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c23-s88"><em><span class="color">Molded Chocolate Loaf with Whipped Cream</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Gâteau Moulé au Chocolat, Crème Chantilly</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ cup water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 ounces (3 squares) bitter chocolate</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>6 tablespoons (3 ounces) softened, unsalted butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 eggs, separated</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¾ cup sugar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ cup flour</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 scant teaspoon vanilla extract</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 small pinch salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup heavy cream</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ cup sugar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page332"></a>Stir the water and the chocolate squares together in a round-bottomed metal mixing bowl, over a low flame, until melted, remove from the heat, whip in the butter, then the egg yolks, and finally the sugar, the flour, and the scant teaspoon vanilla. If, at this point, the mixture seems to curdle or disintegrate (it is only the action of the chocolate rehardening in contact with colder ingredients), place the bowl in another bowl filled with warm water, continue stirring, and it will come back together. Beat the egg whites and salt until they stand stiffly in peaks, gently fold about ⅓ of the entire volume into the chocolate mixture, then the remainder. Pour into a buttered quart mold (a savarin or a decorative jelly mold with central tube) and poach in a <em>bain-marie</em>, in a medium oven, immersed in hot water to approximately the same level as the pudding’s surface on the inside, for 40 minutes. Leave to cool slightly and unmold onto the serving plate, leaving the mold over the pudding until serving time. Whip the cream with the sugar and ½ teaspoon vanilla extract. Serve well chilled, either with whipped cream separately, or the central well filled with whipped cream and a decorative ribbon of it piped around the base of the pudding.</p>
