<p class="summary"><span class="bi">Manuel Ruiz López, known as Manolo el Sereno, worked on an estate in Jaén,</span> Andalusia, from the age of seven until he was drafted into the Spanish Army of Africa. His ten siblings were all placed in work when they were seven years old, the girls with families in town. Manolo worked with the mules. In Castile and northern Spain, oxen were the main work animals, but in Andalusia, it was mules. In the winter, Manolo and the other resident laborers slept with the mules, horses, and donkeys to keep warm.</p>
<p class="summary">Manolo returned from the army to find work as the <span class="italic">sereno,</span> night watchman, in Frailes, a village in the province of Jaén, deep in the interior of the Sierra Sur. Today his official job is to measure the rainfall and the height of the river. He is also the president of El Dornillo, the gastronomic guild of the province (a <span class="italic">dornillo</span> is the huge wooden mortar that peasants took to the fields to make gazpacho).</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p187.png" class="calibre10"/></p>
<p class="summary">When the travel writer Michael Jacobs (see page 390) chaired a panel on the Moorish influence on food in Spain at the Hay Festival in Granada in 2008, Manolo and a group of friends arrived with olive branches, vegetables, fruits, herbs, and kitchen utensils—an entire installation—as props for our panel. Then Manolo took me and my copanelist Alicia Ríos back to stay in his house, which he shared with his disabled sister (she has, sadly, passed away since then). Downstairs it was a modest but comfortable traditional village house; upstairs, it was grand. In the living room, there was a shelf filled with books all inscribed to Manolo. Later he told us that he never formally learned to read and write and had depended on people he met to teach him. He now writes with the most beautiful hand, and his greatest joy is giving hospitality to writers. As the days went by, I felt extremely lucky and happy to be a writer on the receiving end of his enormous generosity. I stayed in a room with a super-glamorous en-suite bathroom, where Sara Montiel, a megastar of the 1950s, slept when she came a few years before for the showing of one of her films at the long-abandoned local mini cinema. Her photographs—one with Manolo—are pinned on the walls.</p>
<p class="summary">Around the house are fruit and nut trees—apricot, quince, fig, pear, almond, pistachio, chestnut—and a vegetable garden. There are also chickens and rabbits. There is an outdoor space with stone tables and lighting—the kind you might get on a nightclub terrace—where Manolo entertains friends. In another part of the yard is a playground for his friends’ children.</p>
<p class="summary">On many occasions, I sat with Alicia, Manolo, and his sister Carmelita at a little round table covered by a heavy blanket, under which was an electric brazier. I asked him, while we picked at food, what life was like on the <span class="italic">cortijo</span> when he was growing up. <span class="italic">Cortijos</span> are the complex of farm buildings around a courtyard that are at the center of the old Andalusian estates. Vegetables and fruit were cultivated in an area around the <span class="italic">cortijo</span>. Part of the estate was given over to wheat, barley, and other crops such as lentils, beans, and chickpeas. Some of it was grazing land for sheep and goats. Horses and fighting bulls were also raised on some estates. <span class="italic">Haciendas</span> were grander versions of the <span class="italic">cortijo,</span> combining a farm and a stately country house.</p>
<p class="summary">Landowners had overseers to manage their estates, and <span class="italic">caseras,</span> housekeepers, to look after the house. They rented parts of their land to <span class="italic">labradores,</span> peasant farmers; the poorest, most arid, and most distant bits of the estate went to <span class="italic">peletrines,</span> small sharecroppers. While the women cultivated their gardens and kept chickens, the men got work plowing with their own draught animals on the estate. Day laborers, <span class="italic">braceros</span> or <span class="italic">jornaleros,</span> who lived in villages and towns, sometimes far away, were employed on a seasonal basis, and during harvest time, they were put up on the estate. As many as a hundred men slept on the floor of a long barn. Entire families were put up in tiny outbuildings. The women and children picked chickpeas, beans, and lentils. Manolo was one of those who lived permanently on the estate as servants. Although his main job was tending the mules, sometimes he helped the woman who cooked for the laborers. They made gazpacho, <span class="italic">cocidos, potajes,</span> and <span class="italic">ajo blanco</span> (with bean flour, not almonds). Every morning the men made <span class="italic">migas</span> with leftover bread. When the <span class="italic">jornaleros</span> were working in the fields, they organized feasts. They danced and sang and played flamenco music (some <span class="italic">jornaleros</span> were Gypsies).</p>
<p class="summary">Manolo is the most popular man in Frailes because during his time as a watchman, he saw everything and knew everything that was going on, and he helped everyone (he says he stopped burglars from breaking into houses but let them off). He also worked at the pharmacy with his sister and assisted the doctor, giving injections. Despite being eighty, he is still immensely strong. I thought he was short when I first met him, but most people in Frailes are smaller still. He took us to visit friends of his. The Rosales had <span class="italic">arroz caldoso</span> with rabbit and chicken simmering in the fireplace and invited us to eat. José Velasco Serrano, who used to work as a cook during the season in Palma de Majorca and now caters for hundreds of people at festivals, talked about recipes of the Balearic Islands. Beautiful Mercedes, a social worker who lives in a large new house with her teacher husband and two children, talked nostalgically of the times when she moved with her parents and siblings around the country to do the harvest, and went grape picking for the <span class="italic">vendimias</span> in La Mancha and in France.</p>
<p class="summary">Now the land in this part of Andalusia has been given over entirely to olive trees. It has been divided many times among children of landowning families. Over the last two to three decades, many of the small sharecroppers and old laborers bought bits of land from the old estates from their savings earned abroad. They bring their olives to a cooperative for pressing. Their oil represents sixty percent of the production of Jaén, the bit of Spain that is the greatest producer of olive oil in the world. Many <span class="italic">cortijos</span> have been sold to English people, as have the little peasant houses and the barns where the work animals used to sleep. Manolo says Spain has changed more in the last twenty-five years than it had in centuries. While the young eat fast foods and sandwiches, older people still cook the things that were part of the old life. Many of Manolo’s recipes and those of his friends are in this book.</p>
