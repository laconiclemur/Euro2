<h2 class="h2b">PISSALADIERE</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Caramelised Onion Tart</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>This is the pizza of Nice, and a rich creamy slice can be found at most street corners in the old town, in cafés</em>, traiteurs <em>and even market caravans. Sweet from the onions, salty with the anchovies and oily from the olives, it’s eaten warm, cold or straight from the oven. It’s all in the onions: it is absolutely vital to soften them completely before you even consider caramelising them. If it takes a little longer than it says here, just wait: the soft, sweet, sticky mixture will be well worth it</em>.</p>

<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4 GENEROUS STARTERS</span><br/>
About ½ recipe <em>Fougasse</em> dough (<em><a href="chapter_006q.html#page182">see here</a></em>) or puff pastry</p>
</div>
<div class="hang00">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">TOPPING</span><br/>
1kg (2lb 4oz) onions, peeled and sliced<br/>
6 large garlic cloves, peeled and sliced<br/>
100ml (3½ fl oz) olive oil<br/>
Salt and caster sugar<br/>
15 salted anchovy fillets, rinsed<br/>
15 black olives, halved and stoned</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 180°C/350°F/Gas 4.</p>
<p class="normala">Put the onion and garlic into a shallow pan with a tight-fitting lid with the olive oil, a teaspoon each of salt and sugar, and 100ml (1½fl oz) water. Cover the pan and cook the onions without colouring for about 10 minutes or more until completely soft and creamy. Take off the lid, turn up the heat and stand over the onions, stirring frequently, for 15 minutes or so until they are a dark caramel colour and the liquid has all but gone.</p>
<p class="normala">Roll out the <em>fougasse</em> dough or puff pastry to fit a 20cm (8in) tin. If you are using puff pastry, prick it well. Spread your onions evenly over this, decorate in a criss-cross or lattice design with the anchovies, then go around and fill the little holes with the olives. Bake the <em>pissaladière</em> for 20 minutes or so until the base is wonderfully crisp and the top is dark gold.</p>
