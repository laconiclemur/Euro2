  <p class="noindenti"><span class="blue1"><span class="italic">“There are several kinds of kougelhopf. I prefer the traditional sweet one, stuffed with raisins or currants, decorated with almonds, and sprinkled with confectioners’ sugar. It goes well with a dry Alsatian wine, or a Muscat. The salted version, most often enjoyed with a glass of Gewurztraminer, of course has no powdered sugar or almonds, but it has walnuts inside and out, and bits of bacon replacing the raisins.</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindenti"><span class="blue1"><span class="italic">“Because Alsatian bakeries are closed on Sunday and there is no fresh bread, the kougelhopf lends a festive presence to the Sunday breakfast table.</span></span></p>

Back in the twelfth century, the emperor Barbarossa accorded the potters of Soufflenheim the right in perpetuity to take clay out of the ground for their superbly decorated pottery. To cure one of the pretty kougelhopf molds, first immerse the pot in cold water for a few minutes, then dry it, butter it, bake it in a hot oven, and let it cool. Repeat the operation before placing the pot in service. No need to wash it after each use, merely wipe with a cloth.”</span></span></p>

I find it especially good in these macaroons. Baking these delicate pastries requires a careful eye on the oven temperature—and instinct born of experience.”</span></span></p>

La Tarasque gobbled enthusiastically and plunged back into the river, replete. But that solution didn’t satisfy the village, for while the pâtissier was dealing successfully with the dragon problem, he neglected his other pastries. He set out to invent yet another cake, this one with a crust of stone. When he lowered it into the river, La Tarasque eagerly reached for it, but the crust of stone broke her snout and all 320 of her teeth. She has never been seen since.

  <p class="ing"><span class="vio">8–12 slices French bread, toasted</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2"><span class="vio">✓</span> Make the aioli in a large mortar. Mash garlic cloves to a paste. Stirring constantly with the pestle always in the same direction, add salt and 1 egg yolk, then slowly begin to trickle oil in. As the mixture thickens, after 3–4 tablespoons of oil, stir in lemon juice and 1/2 teaspoon warm water, then resume stirring oil in, bit by bit. Each time sauce feels too thick, again add a few drops of warm water; this will prevent separation. (However, if the aioli does “break,” it can be rescued. Scrape it into a bowl and clean the mortar. Place in the mortar an extra yolk and a bit more lemon juice and then, stirring constantly with the pestle, reincorporate the broken aioli slowly, spoon by spoon.)</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="vio">✓</span> Reserve half the aioli in a mixing bowl, and place half in a sauceboat for the table.</p>

Bring to a boil and reduce to simmer. After 10 minutes, as various fish are done, remove to serving dish and keep warm. Discard bouquet garni. If desired, boil down stock somewhat. Remove from heat.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="vio">✓</span> In bowl with reserved aioli, stir in 1 cup fish stock and 4 egg yolks. Whisk aioli-yolk mixture into soup, stirring over low heat until it starts to thicken. Do not boil.</p>

Some insist that to choose a good Cavaillon melon, you must count the stripes—there should be exactly ten, no more, no less—and the stripes must be bluish-green. There is now a Confrérie des Chevaliers de l’Ordre du Melon de Cavaillon/Brotherhood of the Knights of the Order of the Cavaillon Melon. And in summertime there is the inevitable Fête des Melons.

The action is, of course, predawn.</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindenti"><span class="vio"><span class="italic">“To make a good flaugnarde, you have to get up early . . . or so said my grandmother, who on autumn Sundays always used to prepare one for us kids. We would sit around her kitchen table and enjoy the flaugnarde—a sort of flan—while playing cards. Today I take pleasure in recreating the experience with my own family, using the same words she used to summon the tribe. Then I warm a small shot of rum, ignite it, and let the blue flames dance over the flaugnarde.”</span></span></p>

This was a time when fishing in the North Atlantic was still an important source of economic affluence for us.”</span></span></p>
