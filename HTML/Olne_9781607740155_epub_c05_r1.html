  <p class="nonindent sgc-1"><a id="page152"></a>When faced with the problem of composing a menu for two, one is nearly always tempted to fall back on a simple hors d’oeuvre and a <em>grillade</em>, there being few <em>cuisiné</em> preparations practicable for a small service. Lobster and partridge both lend themselves by nature to a luxurious concept of eating and, by size, to a meal for two. There is otherwise no reason that this menu may not be conceived for any number of guests.</p>

  <p class="indent">The cucumber salad does nothing for a wine and, if one were drinking a light white wine or champagne as apéritif, it would be better to continue it during the first course rather than to dissipate the pleasure of beginning a carefully chosen great white wine at the moment the lobster is served.</p>

  <p class="indent">All preparations, with the exception of the actual baking of the lobster, the roasting of the young partridge, and whipping the cream for dessert, are automatically finished well before the dinner hour (the cabbage and old partridge may even be prepared the previous day and gently reheated without suffering).</p>

  <p class="indent">The lobster should be put to cook just before going to table and the partridge to roast no earlier than ten minutes after the lobster has been served—lobster is not a thing to eat hurriedly and it is far better to wait for a roast partridge than to risk making <em>it</em> wait.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_2">THE CUCUMBER SALAD IN CREAM SAUCE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Cream sauce is occasionally a pleasant change from a vinaigrette for a green salad and nicely accommodates any number of raw vegetable hors-d’oeuvre salads. Raw mushrooms, first marinated in lemon juice and seasoning, the cream added later, are delicious. Lemon juice should always replace vinegar when cream is used. With cucumbers, fresh dill may replace the chervil.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c05-s20"><a id="page153"></a><em><span class="color">Cucumber Salad, Cream Sauce</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Concombres Frais à la Crème</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 medium cucumbers</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 lemon</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup heavy cream</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon chopped chervil</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Peel the cucumbers and rinse them (a precaution against an occasional bitter-tasting skin). They may either be split lengthwise, the seeds removed, and sliced thinly, or, for a prettier presentation, cut into approximately 2-inch lengths, seeded with a coring device, and each section cut into rings. Spread them in layers in a soup plate or bowl, generously sprinkling each layer with salt, leave them for an hour or two to rid them of their excess water, and drain them well, pressing firmly.</p>

  <p class="indent">Mix the lemon juice (starting with the juice of ½ lemon and adding more later, if necessary) and pepper (but not salt) in a bowl and slowly stir in the cream. Mix together with the cucumbers, mound the mixture neatly on the serving plate and sprinkle with the chervil.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_3">THE BAKED LOBSTER GARIN</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">The simple but ingenious notion of punching a hole in the carapace through which to enrich the flesh of the lobster with herb butter while it cooks eliminates any risk of its drying out. The juices are an retained. The claws lend themselves imperfectly to this preparation and are poached separately <em>à la nage</em>.</p>

  <p class="indent">The preparation of the butter has been slightly simplified for a home service—in the restaurant version, a fish <em>fumet</em> (see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c26_r1.htm#c26-s98">Sole Fillets with Fines Herbes</a>) replaces the white wine, the reduction is less intense and is then mounted over a low heat, like a <em>beurre blanc</em>. The <a id="page154"></a>restaurant presentation may also involve the lobster’s being lightly flamed at the moment of service with a bit of preheated pastis.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c05-s21"><em><span class="color">Baked Lobster Garin</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Homard au Four, Façon Garin</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="extract"><em>Herb butter:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup dry white wine</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2½ tablespoons pastis (or other anise-flavored liqueur)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 large pinch <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#page86">Mixed Herbs</a></em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ pound softened butter</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Anchovy butter:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 anchovy fillet</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon (½ ounce) butter</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Court-bouillon</em> (<em>for the claws</em>)<em>:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup dry white wine</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>mixed herbs, parsley, bay leaf</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 small onion, sliced</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>a few carrot slices</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, 5 or 6 peppercorns</em><br />
    <br /></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 tablespoons olive oil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 lively lobster weighing about 1½ pounds</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE HERB BUTTER</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Reduce the white wine, pastis, and herbs over a high flame until only about 3 tablespoonfuls of liquid remain in the saucepan. Leave until lukewarm, season with salt and freshly ground pepper and whisk vigorously with the softened butter. (Part of this butter will serve for basting and the remainder will accompany the lobster at table.)</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE ANCHOVY BUTTER</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Soak the anchovy fillet (preferably salted and not preserved in oil) in water for ½ hour to desalt it, sponge it dry in paper toweling, mash it to <a id="page155"></a>a fine paste in a mortar, then mash in the butter (ordinarily, it would be passed through a sieve—for this preparation, it is not essential).</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE COURT-BOUILLON</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Bring the liquids to a boil, add all the other ingredients, with the exception of the peppercorns, and simmer, covered, for a good ½ hour—the peppercorns will be added a few minutes before the lobster claws.</p>

  <p class="indent">Pour the olive oil into a heavy oval <em>poêle</em> or gratin dish, as nearly as possible of just the size to hold the lobster, and heat it in a very hot oven (475°–500° F.). Tear off the claws—a simple twist is all that is necessary—and put them into the court-bouillon to poach, covered; after they have simmered for 10 minutes, remove the saucepan from the flame, leaving them in the cooking liquid, and put the lobster into its oven-heated dish. Turn it around in the hot oil several times over a period of about 10 minutes, or until it is equally reddened on all sides. Lower the heat of the oven to about 325° F., take out the pan and, using the end of the handle of a wooden spoon (for instance), punch a hole in the center (top side) of the lobster shell, which contains the coral and terminates in the head, and insert the anchovy butter and as much of the herb butter as can be forced in. Return it to the oven, and over a period of 20 minutes, regularly force more herb butter into the hole (4 to 5 tablespoons in all).</p>

  <p class="indent">Split the lobster in two, discard the gravel sack (“queen”) to be found at the head’s extremity, and serve accompanied by the rest of the herb butter. Serve the claws after.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="rh16">BRAISED AND ROAST PARTRIDGE WITH CABBAGE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Braised old partridge (<em>perdrix</em>) and cabbage usually is served “as is,” the bird picked out from its nest of cabbage and presented crowning the mound of cabbage, the garnish of carrots and side pork surrounding it. A sausage is often braised and included in the garnish. (Out of game season, guinea fowl may be treated in the same way.) One must not expect too much of the old partridge, all of whose flavor has gone <a id="page156"></a>to enrich the cabbage, but in combination with the young partridge (<em>perdreau</em>) roasted slightly rare, just out of the oven, the total experience is perfect.</p>

  <p class="indent">Should the cabbage-braising liquid remain from a recent <em><a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c22_r1.htm#page322">Pot-au-Feu</a></em>, it will serve splendidly. While it is unlikely that the home cook will use a concentrated stock made exclusively from partridge carcasses, the result, when this essence serves as the braising liquid, is spectacular.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c05-s22"><em><span class="color">Braised and Roast Partridge with Cabbage</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Perdrix aux Choux</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 medium cabbage (2 to 2½ pounds)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2¾-inch slices (about ½ pound) lean salt side pork (substitute slab bacon, if necessary)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 old partridge</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon (½ ounce) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ cup white wine</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#page74">Mirepoix</a>; if prepared especially, use 1 medium carrot, 1 large onion, and more herbs than usual</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 whole, peeled carrots</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about</em> 2 <em>cups rich, gelatinous <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#rh1">Veal Stock</a></em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Roast partridge:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 young partridge (hung for 3 or 4 days but not “high”)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pinch oregano</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon (½ ounce) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 thin sheet fat side pork (not bacon)</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Remove the outer leaves from the cabbage, cut it in two, cut out the core, separate the leaves, and pare the thick ribs from each. Gather the leaves together on a chopping board and shred them coarsely (about ½-inch strips). Parboil the cabbage in a large quantity of salted water for 10 to 15 minutes and drain it thoroughly in a colander, pressing the leaves well.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page157"></a>Cover the slices of salt pork with cold water, bring to a boil, simmer for 8 to 10 minutes and drain.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cook the old partridge in the butter, in a small skillet or heavy saucepan, for about 15 minutes, turning it regularly, keeping the flame low enough to avoid any smoking. When it is lightly colored on all sides, remove it and wash out the pan with the white wine, scraping loose any frying adherents and reducing the liquid to a tablespoon or two.</p>

  <p class="indent">Line the bottom of a heavy copper saucepan or an earthenware or enameled cast-iron casserole with half the <em>mirepoix</em>, spread a bed of cabbage on top, place the partridge in the middle, a carrot and a slice of side pork to either side, pour over the bit of white wine reduction from the partridge’s cooking pan, regularly distribute the remaining <em>mirepoix</em>, and add the rest of the cabbage, packing it lightly and smoothing the surface. Heat the stock enough to melt it, pour in enough to rise just above the cabbage’s surface, bring to a boil over medium heat, and cook, covered, either over a tiny flame or in a slow oven, at a bare simmer, for at least 2½ hours in all. After 1 to 1½ hours, the side pork should be thoroughly cooked. Remove it carefully and put it aside. If at this time the quantity of liquid seems excessive, continue the braising with the lid ajar to permit evaporation; if it seems low, add some boiling stock. After 2½ hours, remove the partridge, lift the flesh from the bones (it will be in a condition to fall off), chop it coarsely, and return it to the cabbage. The braising liquid should be almost completely reduced—if the cabbage is still quite liquid, continue cooking it for 10 to 15 minutes on top of the stove with the lid off, at a sufficient heat to produce a regular, gentle bubbling. (If it is to be reheated, it may remain slightly liquid—it will arrive at the correct state of reduction through a slow reheating.) Return the side pork a few minutes before serving to heat through. Taste for salt; none should be needed, as the stock, the <em>mirepoix</em> and the pork are all salted and the reduction should do the rest.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE ROAST PARTRIDGE</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Once cleaned and singed, sprinkle salt, pepper and oregano into the body cavity, insert the butter, salt and pepper the outside, place the sheet of fat pork over the breast, and tie the bird, encircling it 2 or 3 times with kitchen string to keep the slice of fat in place.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page158"></a>It is difficult to give a precise timing or method for roasting partridge—a fresh specimen requires a bit longer than one several days old, and, despite thermostats, ovens differ.</p>

  <p class="indent">Choose a heavy, shallow roasting pall, just large enough to hold the trussed bird (a small crêpe pan, despite the theory that it should only serve its intended purpose, is just the right size—or a tiny gratin dish), start it out in a very hot oven and, after 5 minutes or so, turn it down to about 350° F. After 10 to 12 minutes in the oven, clip the strings, remove the sheet of fat, and 5 minutes later turn the oven off, leaving the bird in the oven for another 5 or 6 minutes (something over 20 minutes, in all). From the time the slice of fat is removed, it should be basted every couple of minutes. When done, the flesh of the breast should remain slightly rose in color. (A more usual but less satisfactory method consists in roasting it unattended in a 400° F. oven for 18 minutes.)</p>

  <p class="indent">Mound the cabbage onto a preheated, deep serving platter, split the roast partridge in two, place the halves on the cabbage, and surround them with the slices of side pork, each cut into 4 or 5 sections, and the carrots, cut into thick slices.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c05-s23"><em><span class="color">Fresh Figs with Raspberry Cream</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Figues à la Crème Framboisée</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pound fresh figs (tree-ripened and freshly picked, if possible)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ pound fresh raspberries</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>⅔ cup heavy cream</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Peel the figs, leaving them whole (the skin pulls off very easily in strips), arrange them in a serving dish, and chill them well. Pass the raspberries through a nylon (not metal) drum sieve and stir in the sugar. Whip the chilled cream in a chilled bowl until just stiff, mix in the raspberry purée and pour over the figs.</p>
