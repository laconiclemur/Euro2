<p class="summary"><span class="bi">Spaniards adore fish and seafood. Despite the depletion of their stock</span> through overfishing, they still have a huge variety caught in the waters of both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Hake, monkfish, tuna, and bream are favorites; turbot, skate, sole, red mullet, sardines, and anchovies are popular too. The list of splendid mollusks and crustaceans caught off the coasts sounds, in Spanish, like a magic incantation: <span class="italic">sepia, pulpo, percebes, vieiras, zamburiñas, almejas, berberechos, mejillones, bueyes, centollos, changurros, nécoras, quisquillas, camarones, gambas, carabineros, cigalas, langostinos, langostas, bogavantes, navajas, lapas, bígaros</span>. Shrimp and clams are much used—sometimes they seem to be thrown into a dish as an adornment.</p>
<p class="summary">Traditional fish and seafood specialties, including soups, stews, omelets, and rice dishes, are invariably said to have originated as what fishermen once cooked for themselves on boats or their wives prepared for them at home. And older fishermen say that until the 1960s, when tourism emerged, they fished only for their own consumption, as they could rarely sell their catch. Even including lobster, seafood was considered poor food, because the elites and the aristocracy had only ever valued meat in the past. And due to the high mountains and lack of transport in the Spanish hinterland before roads were built in the 1960s, fresh saltwater fish was hardly ever consumed inland. The only fish available in the interior was from the rivers—trout, salmon, and eels—and salt cod, <span class="italic">bacalao</span>. As meat was strictly forbidden by the Church on days of abstinence, which amounted to a good part of the year, preserved salt cod became the substitute for meat.</p>
<p class="summary">To understand just how important and appreciated the products of the sea have become today in Spain, you have only to visit a market in any big town and see the lines of people at the fish stalls. They watch the fishmonger in anticipation as he or she (the women who sell fish are dressed in elegant white blouses, coiffed, and bejeweled) cleans and prepares the fish and seafood with art and tenderness. Spain consumes more fish and seafood per capita than any other country except Japan.</p>
<p class="summary">Many of those old dishes that fishermen cooked in the past must have acquired glamour and sophistication. Did they really use all that wine and brandy as people do now? Did they really make the fantastic sauces? But they certainly would have lavished time and love on what was their major staple. Rural folk were once very suspicious of strange-looking creatures from the sea, but today it is the crustaceans and mollusks thrown together pell-mell into a soup or a paella that lure tourists into quayside and coastal restaurants. Josep Pla, the greatest writer in the Catalan language, complained in the 1960s about the spectacular new dishes that were, he said, a “diabolical combination of fish of all categories . . . a disorder against nature . . . not the integrated symphony that it should be.” In the past, fishermen threw anything they did not sell into their soups and stews, but what Pla was complaining about was the kind of dishes that seaside restaurants were inventing to attract customers.</p>
<p class="summary">Those spectacular dishes that are a feast for the eye may also be difficult and messy to eat. When you come to cook them, you can choose versions referred to on restaurant menus as “<span class="italic">del señor,</span>” which do not entail using your fingers to crack open shells and pull out morsels as you eat.</p>
<p class="summary">You will find more seafood dishes in the chapter on rice.</p>
