<h2 class="h2b">SOUFFLE DE POIVRONS ROUGES</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Twice-cooked Red Pepper Soufflé</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>Both cooks and guests adore these soufflés: the cooks because they can be prepared at least 12 hours in advance; and guests just enjoy the crispy coating and soft centre. Undercook them slightly during the first baking so that they puff and blow during the second. The red pepper chutney provides a sharp contrast, but you could just as easily serve the soufflés with an olive oil-dressed green salad or roasted vegetables</em>.</p>
<div class="hang0">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
1 very large red pepper, seeded<br/>
2 tbsp vegetable oil<br/>
Salt and cayenne pepper<br/>
30g (1¼oz) butter, plus extra, well softened, for the moulds<br/>
2 tbsp plain flour<br/>
100ml (3½fl oz) milk<br/>
1 large egg yolk, plus 3 egg whites<br/>
100g (3½oz) Provençal breadcrumbs (<em><a href="chapter_001i.html#page31">see here</a></em>)<br/>
4 tbsp <em>Pistou</em> (<em><a href="chapter_006f.html#page170">see here</a></em>), with Parmesan</p>
</div>
<div class="hang00a">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">RED PEPPER CHUTNEY</span><br/>
2 large red peppers, seeded and sliced into strips<br/>
3 tbsp olive oil<br/>
50ml (2fl oz) water<br/>
30ml (1fl oz) red wine vinegar<br/>
1 tbsp honey</p>
</div>
<div class="hang00">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">TO SERVE</span><br/>
1 small bunch rocket</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 190°C/375°F/Gas 5.</p>
<p class="normala">Roast the red pepper for the soufflé in the vegetable oil with a little salt and cayenne for half an hour, or until soft but not coloured. Transfer the pepper to a blender and blend until fine. Put the purée in a pan and reduce it over a high heat by about two thirds, stirring constantly. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.</p>
<p class="normala">Melt the 30g butter in a small saucepan. Remove from the heat and stir in the flour until smooth. Still off the heat, stir in the milk and return to the heat. Bring the mixture to the boil (it should thicken enough to come away from the side of the pan) and add the red pepper purée. Transfer to a bowl, cool slightly and whisk in the egg yolk. Season well with salt and cayenne.</p>
<p class="normala">Line four ramekins well, first with some softened butter then some of the Provençal breadcrumbs. Sprinkle a few extra breadcrumbs into the bottom of the mould (which will eventually be the top of the soufflé) and set aside. You need a few breadcrumbs left over to finish the dish.</p>
<p class="normala">Whisk the egg whites to firm peaks then mix a third into the pepper mixture. This can be done quite briskly: the idea is to have the mixture similar in texture to the egg whites. Add this to the remaining egg white and fold gently to combine. Fill the lined ramekins with the soufflé mixture. Put a teaspoon of the <em>pistou</em> in the middle of each soufflé, pushing it down a little.</p>
<p class="normala">Place the ramekins into a bain-marie of hot water that reaches two-thirds of the way up the sides of the ramekins, and bake in the preheated oven for 8–10 minutes (the soufflés should still be slightly soft in the centres). Leave the soufflés to cool for a few minutes.</p>
<p class="normala">Spread the remaining breadcrumbs over a small oven tray. Remove the soufflés from their moulds, arrange them evenly spaced on top of the breadcrumbs, and set aside in a cool place for up to 12 hours (but not in the fridge).</p>
<p class="normala">Meanwhile, for the red pepper chutney, combine all the ingredients in a pan, cover and allow to simmer over a medium heat for 15 minutes until the peppers soften. Boil until the liquid is almost completely evaporated, remove from the heat, season with salt and cayenne, and set aside.</p>
<p class="normala">To serve, preheat your oven to 200°C/400°F/Gas 6, and cook the soufflés for 6 minutes or until they puff up and get crusty on the outside.</p>
<p class="normala">Toss the red pepper chutney with the rocket and serve with the soufflés. Sprinkle any remaining crumbs over the top.</p>
