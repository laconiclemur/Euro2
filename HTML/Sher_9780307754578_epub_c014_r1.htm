  <h1 class="subchapter" id="heading_id_2">(Süsspeisen, oder Nachspeisen)</h1>

  <p class="center1"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L01_r1.jpg" /></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Whether you call them sweet foods (Süsspeisen) or after foods (Nachspeisen), anyone must pronounce German desserts as rich, luscious and completely irresistible. In Germany, the most interesting desserts appear in homes rather than in restaurants, the latter relying mainly on the ice cream concoctions, stewed fruits and such international regulars as Crepes Suzette and Baked Alaska.</p>

  <p class="indent">In addition to the desserts here, all sorts of fruits and flavorings, such as coffee, chocolate, pumpernickel crumbs, cinnamon and grated lemon rind, rum and citron, are often whipped into cottage cheese, chilled and served. Flavored whipped creams, frozen or half frozen, are also favorites. The most persistent flavors in German desserts are of apples, cherries, macaroons, pumpernickel crumbs, rum, arrack, vanilla and lemon rind, and almost everything ends up in a cloud of whipped cream. If there seems to be a great many rice and apple desserts here, it’s because there are so many in Germany.</p>

  <p class="indent">Two related types of desserts that are very popular in Germany are the gelatins (Süsse Sülze oder Gelee) and the puddings or flummeries (Flammeri oder Grütze). Both consist of such liquids as fruit juice, wine, milk or buttermilk with various flavorings. The first type is set with unflavored gelatin. The second is thickened with a starch such as potato flour, rice, farina or semolina, or cornstarch. The gelatins are very much like our packaged Jell-O desserts; the flummeries are closer to our packaged chocolate or vanilla puddings. Although you might not think these worth the effort, considering the final effect, you will find <a id="page353"></a>the homemade versions have a much richer flavor than the packaged variety. Packaged-gelatin and flummery desserts are, of course, used by German housewives when they are pressed for time. These German products are imported into this country and, I think, have a slight edge over our own in both flavor and texture. If you live near a German neighborhood and can get them, you might like to try them and decide for yourself.</p>

  <p class="indent">Sometimes it is difficult to tell an entree from a dessert in Germany without a program—which in itself says something interesting about that country’s eating habits and its national sweet tooth. And as you can see from the Index, there are many desserts elsewhere in this book.</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_4"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>PUDDINGS AND SOUFFLÉS (Puddinge und Aufläufe)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">By our standards, all of these desserts are more puddings than soufflés. Although all are lightened and raised by beaten egg white, they contain very heavy ingredients and do not have the airy, cloudlike quality we associate with soufflés. The real French soufflés, consisting mainly of a sauce base, flavoring or filling, and beaten egg white, are served in Germany and are called by their French names.</p>

  <p class="indent">As for the Puddinge and Aufläufe, the main difference between them is in the method of cooking. A pudding is steamed in a covered mold. It should be buttered and may be sprinkled with sugar or crumbs, depending on the specific recipe. It should never be more than two-thirds full, as the pudding must have room to expand. Once covered, the mold should be set in a large pot of water. The water should come between halfway and two-thirds up the sides of the mold. The larger pot is then covered and the pudding steamed until it is completely set. The lid can be removed carefully during cooking so that the pudding can be tested. Let the pudding stand 5 minutes or so when it is done, and then invert it onto a serving platter. If you are serving sauce with <a id="page354"></a>it, pour a little over the pudding and the rest into a sauce boat. An Auflauf consists of the same ingredients as a pudding, but it is baked in a soufflé dish or comparable open baking dish. This may be set in a pan of water, depending on the specific recipe. To serve, simply spoon the pudding directly out of the baking dish and cover with sauce.</p>

  <p class="indent">Usually, the same filling indicated for a pudding mold can be baked in a buttered soufflé dish that is then set in a pan half full of hot water. However, the molded pudding makes a far more festive appearance. To complicate things further, I must tell you that it is also possible to turn the filling into a buttered sugar- or crumb-sprinkled soufflé dish or porcelain pudding mold, and then to steam it in a covered pot half full of water, on the stove instead of in the oven. This will give a moist, light, unbrowned pudding.</p>

  <p class="indent">It is best to serve any of the puddings after a light meal rather than a heavy one. They also make excellent and impressive replacements for cake, served with coffee. In Germany they are usually served after a one-pot main course, or a soup, or a platter of cold cuts.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">6 TO 8 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¾ cup converted rice</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 cups milk</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>pinch of salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>strip of lemon peel</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3½ tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 egg yolks</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>⅓ cup sugar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>⅓ cup raisins</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 egg whites, stiffly beaten</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>butter</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Cover rice with water and cook 5 minutes. Drain and add rice to milk, along with salt, lemon peel and butter. Cover and cook very slowly in top of double boiler until rice kernels are tender but not so overcooked that they lose their shape, about 1 to ½ hours. Cool when done. Beat egg yolks and sugar together until mixture is thick and pale yellow. Add, with raisins, to cooked rice mixture and stir through gently with a wooden spoon. Preheat oven to 350°. Beat egg whites to a stiff snow and fold into cold rice-egg-yolk mixture. Use a rubber spatula and fold whites in gently but thoroughly. Butter a 2-quart soufflé dish, or comparable baking dish, and turn rice into it. Dot generously with butter and bake about 45 minutes in preheated oven. When done, pudding should be fairly high, with the custard completely set; the top should be a light golden brown. <em>Serve</em> with Vanilla Sauce or Fruit Sauce.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page355"></a><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. Apple-Rice Soufflé (Apfelreisauflauf): Peel, core and slice 1 pound cooking apples that are not too sour. Prepare rice. Turn half into baking dish, then add apples. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons sugar, dot with butter and cover with remaining rice.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. A little powdered cinnamon, nutmeg or vanilla extract can be mixed in with the rice.</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_6"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>TAPIOCA PUDDING OR SOUFFLÉ (Sagoauflauf)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">Follow above recipe, substituting same amount of tapioca for rice. Use old-fashioned tapioca for this, not the “minute” variety. Soak overnight and cook as for rice.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_7"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>FARINA PUDDING (Greisspudding)</em></h3>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">6 TO 8 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 cups milk</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>strip of lemon peel</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 teaspoon salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup farina</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 egg yolks</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¼ cup sugar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 to 2 tablespoons ground almonds or other nuts</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 to 2 tablespoons raisins or currants</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>rum or arrack, optional and to taste</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 egg whites</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Heat oven to 350°. Scald milk and add butter, lemon peel and salt. When butter has melted, sprinkle in farina, stirring constantly. Cover and simmer slowly but steadily 15 to 20 minutes, or until cereal forms a thick mass and leaves sides of pan. Cool. Remove lemon peel. Beat egg yolks with sugar until thick and lemon-colored. Stir in almonds or nuts, raisins or currants and flavor with a few drops of rum or arrack, if you want to use either. Add to cooled cereal and stir through thoroughly. Beat egg whites until they form stiff peaks and are glossy. Fold lightly but thoroughly into the cereal-egg-yolk mixture. Butter a 2-quart soufflé dish or straight-sided casserole. Sprinkle sides and bottom evenly with sugar and tap out excess. Turn batter into baking dish. Set dish in a larger pan half full of boiling water. Bake pudding in this water bath <a id="page356"></a>1 to 1½ hours, or until a knife blade inserted in the pudding comes out clean. Serve with Fruit Compote.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 stale rolls with crusts, thinly sliced, or 5 slices stale white bread</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¾ cup lukewarm milk</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup sugar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 egg yolks</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>grated rind of ½ lemon</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>⅔ cup almonds, walnuts or hazelnuts, shredded or chopped, or ⅔ cup poppy seeds</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>⅓ cup raisins</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¼ to ½ teaspoon cinnamon to taste</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 egg whites, stiffly beaten</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Put roll or bread slices in a bowl and cover with milk. Soak until milk is absorbed. Cream butter with sugar until light and fluffy, then gradually beat in egg yolks; add grated lemon peel and blend well. Add soaked bread, nuts or poppy seeds and raisins to egg-yolk batter and mix together thoroughly. Flavor with cinnamon. Beat egg whites until stiff and fold into bread mixture, gently but thoroughly, using a rubber spatula. Butter a 4- to 5-cup soufflé dish and turn mixture into it. Place in 450° oven and immediately turn down to 350°. Bake 30 to 45 minutes.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATION</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Cherry or Apple Bread Soufflé (Apfel- oder Kirschenauflauf): Substitute 1 pound peeled, cored, chopped apples or 1 pound washed, dried, pitted and chopped cherries for nuts or poppy seeds. Use raisins with the apples, if you like, but do not use them with cherries. You can use ¾ pound of cherries with ⅓ cup chopped blanched almonds. When made with cherries, this pudding is called, in German, Kirschenmichel.</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_9"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>BEGGARMAN’S APPLE OR APPLE AND BLACK BREAD PUDDING (Apfelbettelmann oder Apfel Pumpernickelauflauf)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">It’s difficult to understand why this succulent pudding should be called “Beggarman’s Apple,” since it is a fragrant dish worthy of any table. It is a perfect dessert to serve after a course of delicatessen or a thick <a id="page357"></a>German soup. It is also an excellent lunch or light dinner served with some cold milk or hot coffee.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup raisins</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 tablespoons dark rum</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1½ cups finely grated pumpernickel breadcrumbs</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¾ cup sugar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 teaspoon cinnamon</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>water or white wine, if necessary</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 or 5 cooking apples (Rome Beauties or Northern Spies are perfect for this)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup chopped pecans or walnuts</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¾ cup seedless green grapes (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Heat oven to 350°. Butter a 1½-quart soufflé or pudding dish. Soak raisins in rum about 20 minutes. Mix breadcrumbs with sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle with rum that has been drained off raisins. Melt butter and stir into breadcrumb mixture. The butter should be evenly distributed through the mixture, which should be as moist as wet sand. If it is too dry, sprinkle with water or white wine. Peel, core and slice apples lengthwise. Slices should be about ⅛″ to ¼″ thick. Place about one-third of breadcrumb mixture in greased baking dish. Follow with half of apples, then sprinkle with soaked raisins, chopped nuts and grapes, if you are using them. Add another layer of breadcrumbs, apples, raisins, etc., ending up with a thick layer of crumbs. Dot well with butter. Bake in middle of preheated oven about 30 minutes, or until apples are tender when pierced with a fork and crumb topping is crisp and brown. Serve with plain or whipped sweet cream.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">The name Ofenschlüpfer means “oven sneak”—why, I can’t imagine.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>6 stale rolls, about the size of Parker House rolls, sliced, or 7 thick slices stale white bread</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup raisins</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 pound cooking apples, not too sour, peeled, cored and thinly sliced, or 1 pound ripe small blue plums, peeled, stoned and cut in half</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><a id="page358"></a><em>1 tablespoon sugar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 teaspoon powdered cinnamon</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 eggs</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons sugar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 to 4 tablespoons flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 to 3 cups milk</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Preheat oven to 375°. Butter a 6-cup soufflé dish or comparable baking dish and arrange half the rolls or bread slices as a bottom layer. Toss raisins together with sliced apples or plums, 1 tablespoon sugar and cinnamon. Place over bread slices and dot with half the butter. Top with rest of bread slices. Make batter by beating eggs with sugar and flour and adding milk until mixture is consistency of thick sweet cream. Pour over bread and apples, dot with rest of butter and bake 1 hour, or until pudding is completely set and golden brown on top. Serve with sweet cream or Vanilla Sauce.</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_11"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>FRANKFURT CHOCOLATE PUDDING (Frankfurter Pudding)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">There are at least a dozen versions of hot steamed chocolate pudding in Germany; this is one of the best and richest.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">8 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¼ pound plus 1 tablespoon butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>⅔ cup sugar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>5 egg yolks</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 ounces melted semi-sweet chocolate</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon rum, or 2 tablespoons strongly brewed black coffee</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1½ cups grated, unblanched almonds</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 tablespoons white bread, pumpernickel or zwieback crumbs</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>5 egg whites stiffly beaten</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>sugar</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Cream butter with sugar until light and fluffy. Gradually beat in one egg yolk at a time until thoroughly blended. Stir in melted chocolate along with rum or coffee; add almonds and crumbs. Fold in stiffly beaten egg whites gently but thoroughly, using a rubber spatula. Butter a melon mold and sprinkle inside with sugar, tapping out excess. Turn filling into mold, which should be about two-thirds full. Cover and set in water bath that comes two-thirds up the sides of the mold. Steam 1 to 1½ hours, or until pudding is completely set, and let stand for a few minutes after it is done. Uncover and invert onto serving platter.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_12"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<a id="page359"></a><em>MOOR IN A SHIRT (Mohr im Hemd)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">After discovering how many different desserts go by this one name throughout Germany and Austria, I found myself asking, “Will the real Moor in the Shirt please stand up?” It covers concoctions that are hot, cold, molded or simply spooned into glasses. In every case there is one part of the dessert that is dark—the chocolate, usually, or pumpernickel breadcrumbs that represent the “moor.” This is covered or topped by a white sauce, vanilla ice cream or whipped cream—the “shirt.”</p>

  <p class="indent">The Frankfurt pudding (above) is one of the more common versions of Moor in a Shirt, though it is steamed in a tall conical mold rather than in the melon shape. Prepare the filling as directed and after the “moor” is unmolded, cover with White Rum Sauce, and top with a “turban” of whipped cream.</p>

  <p class="indent">In Bremen, Moor in a Shirt refers to a sherbet glass half full of cooked cherries or red berries, topped with a layer of pumpernickel breadcrumbs that have been mixed with sugar and cinnamon or grated chocolate, or both. This in turn is topped with a “shirt” of vanilla-flavored whipped cream. To confuse things completely, this is also called, in Bremen, Food of the Gods, or Götterspeise, a name you will also find for the frozen dessert. (There are as many Foods of the Gods as there are Moors in Shirts.)</p>

  <p class="indent">In Bavaria and Austria, the local version is Moor’s Head (Mohrenkopf). It is made up of a chocolate-frosted cream puff filled with vanilla-flavored whipped cream.</p>

  <p class="indent">Chocolate pudding made in individual custard cups and then unmolded and topped with a vanilla sauce and/or whipped cream also becomes Moor in a Shirt. I’m sure there are even more desserts known by that name, but, luckily, I haven’t found them. If you’ve been wondering what to call a scoop of chocolate ice cream covered with whipped cream or marshmallow sauce, why not Moor in a Shirt?</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 egg yolks</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup sugar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons cornstarch</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 to 1½ cups apple wine, white wine or apple juice, or combination of white wine and apple juice</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><a id="page360"></a><em>juice and grated rind of ½ lemon</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>15 to 20 small crisp bitter macaroons, such as Italian amaretti, crushed</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 to 4 tablespoons candied citron (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 egg whites</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¼ cup sugar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>blanched slivered or split almonds</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>confectioners’ sugar</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Preheat oven to 400°. Beat egg yolks with sugar until mixture is very thick and pale yellow. Stir in cornstarch, wine or apple juice, lemon juice and grated rind. Set over hot, not boiling, water which does not touch the bottom of the mixing bowl. Stir until mixture is thick enough to coat a wooden spoon. Stir in macaroon crumbs and pour into 9″ pie plate. Sprinkle with citron, and cool. Beat egg whites and as they thicken, gradually beat in sugar until snow stands in stiff glossy peaks. Spread meringue over egg-yolk mixture. Sprinkle with almonds and confectioners’ sugar. Bake in preheated oven a few minutes, or until meringue is golden brown and pudding is hot all the way through.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. Crumbs can be eliminated from mixture if you prefer a consistency closer to custard than to cake. Or use crushed anise biscuits instead of macaroons.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. Again, if you like a custard consistency, set pie plates over, not in, a pot half full of hot water and bake in oven 10 to 15 minutes.</p>

By the time it is done, all liquid should be absorbed. Check flavoring and add more sugar if needed.</p>

  <p class="indent">Peel and slice apples. Sauté in butter 5 or 8 minutes, turning with a wooden spatula. Apples should be pale golden brown on both sides but they should not get too soft.

Cover with apple slices and spread with thickened preserves. Cover with rest of rice. Preheat broiler. Beat egg whites and as they thicken, gradually add sugar. Beat until whites stand in soft, shiny peaks. Spread egg whites over the apple slices and sprinkle lightly with sugar. Place under preheated broiler 3 to 5 minutes, or until top of meringue is browned.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Stewed fruits of all kinds are served not only as desserts in Germany, but as accompaniments to meat dishes as well. If they are served with meat, they may or may not have a little vinegar added to give them a sharp edge. As desserts, they may be topped with whipped cream, or may themselves be the toppings for various puddings and cold creams.</p>

  <p class="indent">Although stewed dried fruits such as prunes, apricots, apples, etc., are the same in Germany as they are anywhere else, they are used in slightly different ways. They are often served as sauces on cooked hot breakfast cereals, or on dessert puddings. In addition, they may be desserts in themselves, with or without whipped or plain sweet cream, sour cream or yogurt. They also make a most unusual appearance on the dinner table as side dishes for such meats as duck, goose, turkey, pork or ham. In that case they are always flavored with wine, lemon juice or vinegar, and sometimes with cloves and/or cinnamon.</p>

  <p class="indent">To retain its color and flavor, fresh fruit should always be poached or stewed in a sugar syrup. You must always be sure you cook fruit only until barely tender; otherwise it will fall apart and be less attractive to serve. Flavorings such as lemon or orange peel, vanilla bean, whole cloves or stick cinnamon are cooked with the syrup. Wine and lemon juice are generally added after the fruit has cooked. Liqueurs, rum and brandies are always added after the fruit has finished cooking. The fruit should be cooled in the syrup. Usually fruit is peeled, and it may be cooked whole, quartered, halved or sliced, depending on size and your preference. You can also mix various kinds of fruits in a compote. Berries make wonderful compotes but should never actually be cooked; place them in the hot syrup along with any flavorings you want to add. They can then be cooled right in the syrup and served. Always select ripe, perfect fruit or the compote will not have a good appearance or flavor.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page368"></a><strong>SUGAR SYRUP</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Cook ¾ cup sugar in 2 cups water for 5 to 10 minutes, or until mixture forms a sugary syrup. This mixture will do for most of the fruit compotes here; where other proportions are necessary, they are given for specific recipes.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. Apples can be spiced with a stick of cinnamon or a few cloves if you use wine and/or lemon juice. Add either spice to water and sugar as it cooks to a syrup. Rum or arrack can be used for flavoring instead of wine or vanilla.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. You can poach apples in sugar syrup made with white wine instead of water. In that case, do not use vanilla flavoring; add a little more white wine and lemon juice to taste after apples have cooked.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. To prepare Stewed Apples with Anise Seeds, follow recipe, cooking the apples whole or halved in the sugar syrup along with lemon peel, a stick of cinnamon and 2 teaspoons anise seeds. Flavor with white wine and cool in the syrup, from which you remove cinnamon but not the anise.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">4. To give any apple compote a red coloring, add strawberry or raspberry syrup after the fruit has cooked. Either of these berries may be added to apples after cooking and served with them.</p>

The best dried fruit is that which is purchased in bulk and does not have sulphates added; they need overnight soaking. Place soaked or unsoaked fruit in a heavy saucepan with water, wine, ½ cup sugar and clove-studded lemon slices and simmer until done. If more sugar is needed, add as necessary. When fruit is done flavor with lemon juice and more white wine. Chill thoroughly before serving. Although lemon slices are not served with the fruit, they are usually stored with it. This compote tastes best when made a day or two in advance.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. If you prefer, cloves can be eliminated and a stick of cinnamon added with or without the lemon slices.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. Raisins or dried figs can be added. Do not cook them. Add to fruit bowl and cover with hot syrup.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Although a recipe for this is hardly necessary, it is such an important item on German menus, it seemed a good idea to point out a few things about making it. Do not use apples that are too sour and do use apples that have red skins. (Macintosh apples make superb applesauce.) The skins should be cooked with the fruit, as they add to color, flavor and vitamin content of sauce. Apples should be washed, quartered and cored, then cooked in as little water as possible, about ½ cup water to ½ pounds fruit. Add a strip or two of lemon peel and Vi cup sugar, cover pot and simmer until fruit just begins to fall apart. Do not overcook. Purée through a sieve and flavor with more sugar as needed. Other flavorings that can be added include lemon juice and/or white wine, which are especially good if the sauce is to be served with meat or some other main course. If you like, a few cloves or ½ stick cinnamon may be cooked with the apples, or the sauce may be flavored with powdered cloves or cinnamon. Vanilla is also used as flavoring, in which case do not use wine, cinnamon or cloves. Raisins or currants are often added to the hot cooked applesauce. Serve hot, warm or cold.</p>

  <p class="indent">If it matters, there is really a difference between Apfelmus and Apfelbrei. The first is as described above, with the fruit puréed through a sieve. In the second version, the cooked sliced apples are not puréed but are served in the syrup. However, the slices always fall apart and the result looks like lumpy applesauce. Very good sauce can also be made by baking whole unpeeled apples in 1″ or so of water until just tender, and then puréeing and seasoning them.</p>

  <p class="indent">If you buy applesauce already made, add flavorings as described.</p>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page376"></a>Heat oven to 375°. Wash and dry apples. Core and pare one-third way down. (Do not cut all the way through the bottom of apple when you are removing core.) Using a fork, mash marzipan with enough rum so that it softens. Work currants into softened marzipan. Place a small pat of butter in the hollowed core of each apple and then stuff with marzipan filling. Top with an additional dab of butter. Set apples in a baking dish 3″ to 5″ deep. They should be placed close enough to keep them from toppling over, but should not be crammed together. Pour in enough wine to come about one-third up the sides of the apples. Bake 25 to 30 minutes, or until apples are tender all the way through when pierced with a fork or skewer. They should be light golden brown on top. While baking, apples should be basted once or twice with the wine. Remove apples to serving dish. Pour remaining wine from baking dish into a saucepan. Stir in apricot jam and simmer slowly until melted and liquid is reduced to a thick syrup. This should take about 10 minutes. Keep flame low and stir constantly so that the sugar in the jam does not scorch. Spoon this apricot glaze over apples, a little at a time. Repeat until all the glaze has been used and each apple has a shiny golden coating. Let set in a cool place (but do not refrigerate) 1 to 2 hours.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">This is the basic recipe for gelatin desserts, along with variations for specific flavors. It is important to remember that dissolved gelatin will begin to set immediately when added to cold liquid. If possible, always add it to a liquid that is slightly warm, otherwise the gelatin will become lumpy and stringy. Should that happen, heat the whole thing over a low flame until gelatin melts, but do not boil. If it is necessary to stir gelatin into an unwarmed liquid, at least try to have it at room temperature, and stir constantly as you add it. Any of these gelatin desserts become frothy and snowy if they are whipped well with a rotary beater when they are half set. Return to bowl and chill until completely set. The gelatin will then be almost like a mousse.</p>

  <p class="right"><a id="page378"></a><span class="small">8 TO 10 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 to 3 envelopes unflavored gelatin</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup cold water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 quart liquid (fruit juice and/or puree, wine, milk or buttermilk)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ to 1 cup sugar, depending on other flavors</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>juice of 1 lemon</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>vanilla, or other flavoring, to taste</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">If you prefer a soft jelly, use 2 envelopes gelatin; if you would like a stiff er consistency, or if you want to mold the dessert, use 3. Soften gelatin by soaking about 5 minutes in cold water. Set over hot water until completely dissolved. While the gelatin is melting, heat very slightly whichever liquid you are using, just enough to remove any chill. Stir in sugar, lemon juice and other flavorings. Stir dissolved gelatin into this liquid. Pour into a large glass serving bowl, individual dessert glasses or a chilled, rinsed 4- to 5-cup mold. Chill until set, about 5 hours. If you use a mold, dip into hot water a second or two, wipe dry, loosen edges of the gelatin with a pointed knife and invert onto a chilled serving plate.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. Fruit Gelatin (Obstsülze): Use 1 quart cooked juice and/or purée of such fruits as strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, red or black currants or ripe cherries. You may buy these juices bottled or prepare them yourself. To do the latter, start with 1 quart ripe fruit (remove stones from cherries) and cook with ½ cups water about 10 minutes, or until all juice is out of fruit. Purée through a strainer or in a blender. Measure fruit and juice (including cooking liquid) and if you do not have a quart, make up the difference with water, white wine or a combination of both. If you use frozen berries, you will need 4 ten-ounce packages. Thaw and purée. Less sugar is needed with frozen fruit. Flavor fruit gelatins with lemon juice and white wine instead of vanilla. You may combine berry juices for this also.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. Wine Jelly (Weingelee): For liquid, use 3 cups white or red wine and ½ cup water. Flavor with ½ to 1 cup sugar and 2 tablespoons rum or arrack. Use lemon juice but not vanilla.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. Punch Jelly (Punschgelee): For liquid, use 2 cups white wine, 1 cup strongly brewed tea, ½ cup orange juice and ¼ cup lemon juice. Flavor with ¾ to 1 cup sugar and 2 tablespoons rum or arrack. Do not use vanilla.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">4. Buttermilk Jelly (Buttermilchspeise): Use 1 quart buttermilk for liquid. Mix with ¾ cup sugar, 2 tablespoons heavy sweet cream or sour cream and 2 to 4 tablespoons rum or arrack to taste, and a little lemon juice. Or you can omit rum, arrack and lemon juice and flavor with vanilla. To make Yogurt Jelly, substitute 1 quart yogurt for buttermilk and beat with a fork until thin.</p>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page379"></a>5. Chocolate Jelly (Schokoladengelee): Prepare 1 quart cocoa, flavoring it to taste with sugar and vanilla. Stir in gelatin as directed.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">6. Tri-Colored Jelly (Dreifarbengelee): This striped dessert should be prepared in individual parfait-type glasses. Each layer is a different gelatin. Use white buttermilk jelly, chocolate jelly and a red wine or fruit jelly. Fill each glass one-third of the way with one jelly and chill until set. Then a second layer of another gelatin mixture that is cool but not set. Chill until second layer sets. Pour in third layer of cooled but unset gelatin and chill until set again.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 cups mixed candied fruits, such as citron, orange and lemon peel and candied cherries, soaked in kirsch or maraschino liqueur or brandy and drained</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Wash rice well and drain thoroughly in a strainer. Place in a large saucepan along with water and cream or milk, vanilla bean, if you are using it, and salt. (If you use vanilla extract, do not add it yet.) Simmer, covered, over very low heat or in top of double boiler, stirring every once in a while as rice cooks. Cook until tender but not overdone—about 15 to 20 minutes for converted rice; 25 to 35 for raw rice. If vanilla extract is being used, stir it in now. If you used the bean, remove it at this point. Let rice cool to lukewarm in the milk. Do not drain. Soak gelatin in cold water about 5 minutes, or until soft. Set over hot water until completely dissolved, stirring frequently. Stir into lukewarm rice mixture, along with sugar and maraschino liqueur. Chill about 15 minutes, or until mixture thickens. Beat cream until stiff and turn onto top of mixture. Sprinkle with 1 cup of the soaked, drained candied fruits and fold them in together, gently but thoroughly, using a rubber spatula. Rinse an 8- to 10-cup bowl-shaped bombe, or tiered fluted mold or 2 ring molds, and fill with rice mixture. Chill 5 to 7 hours in refrigerator. To unmold, dip mold quickly into hot water, dry and turn onto a chilled platter. Decorate with remaining candied fruit.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. If you prefer, mix all the candied fruits into rice and use none for decoration. Or this mold can be made without any candied fruits at all.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. Whole strawberries and whipped cream can be used as garnishes with or without the candied fruit mixed into the rice.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. One-quarter cup raspberry or strawberry juice can be stirred into the cooked rice to give it a pink color. Maraschino may be used or omitted in that case.</p>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page383"></a>4. To give the dessert a glossy sheen, rinse the empty mold with milk and sprinkle it on sides and bottom with granulated sugar before filling. This makes for a prettier effect, but it is a little more difficult to unmold.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. Vanilla Cream (Vanillecreme): Use milk, flavor it with ¼ vanilla bean that is removed when custard has thickened, or with 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. This can have a little arrack added and 2 or 3 tablespoons whipped cream can be folded in with egg whites. Baked or stewed whole apples can be placed in a wide glass serving bowl and covered with this cream and all chilled together. This is known as Vanilla Apples (Vanilleäpfel). When cream is poured hot over mixed fruit compote with a little rum, the result is Tutti-Frutti Cream (Tutti-Frutticreme).</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. Chocolate Cream (Schokoladencreme): Use milk, 3 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate, that is melted and stirred into the custard mixture, and a little vanilla to taste. Use 1 or 2 egg yolks but 3 whites.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. Caramel Cream (Karamelcreme) : Use milk and add caramel syrup. To make this, heat ⅓ cup sugar slowly in a heavy-bottomed skillet or saucepan until golden brown.

  <p class="nonindent">1. Lemon Cream (Zitronencreme): This dessert is a great favorite of mine, whether it is called cold lemon soufflé, cold lemon pudding or Citronfromage. This version is slightly more lemony than the one which is creamier. Either is delightful after a large meal and could be used as the filling in an open baked pie shell. The mixture could be turned into the shell, chilled and covered with whipped cream. Use 1 cup white wine for liquid. Use grated rind and juice of 2 lemons for flavoring. Beat ⅔ cup sugar into egg yolks.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">5. Coffee Bavarian Cream (Kaffee Bayrische Creme): Use ½ cups milk for liquid and 1 cup coffee brewed double strength for flavoring. Coffee should be black. Add more sugar if necessary as custard cooks.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">6. Hazelnut or Almond Bavarian Cream (Nuss oder Mandel Bayrische Creme): Use ½ cup hazelnuts or almonds. If you use almonds, blanch and slip skins off. If you use hazelnuts, roast in the oven until skins begin to flake, then rub off between two kitchen towels. Grate or crush finely and cover with 2 cups hot, not boiling, milk. Steep 15 minutes. This milk will be the needed liquid. Beat into egg-yolk-sugar mixture along with grated nuts.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Restaurants and Konditoreien feature many ice cream specialties on their menus, to be served after or between meals. Few of them are as simple as a dish of unadorned ice cream. It is more probable that the cream will be sliced from a mold or bombe, or served as an Eisbecher, literally an “ice cap,” or what we call a coupe or sundae. In either case, there will usually be more than one flavor of cream and a dazzling combination of toppings, especially for the Eisbecher. These will include fruits, nuts, liqueurs, crumbled macaroons, bits of chocolate, real or candy coffee beans, nougat, praline and, always, whipped cream for the finale.</p>

  <p class="indent">This section includes some examples of the Eisbecher and bombes that are most popular in Germany. They can be made with commercial or homemade cream.

  <p class="nonindent">These decorative molded desserts lend a festive touch to any dinner party and are quite simple to prepare. To start with, you may use homemade or commercial ice cream or sherbets, or you may make a mousse mixture such as those on the following pages. (Unless you have a crank ice cream freezer, these are the best sort of ice creams to make at home, since they require no stirring and, if properly covered, never form ice splinters.)</p>

  <p class="indent">You will need special bombe molds with tight-fitting lids. Though originally the name “bombe” referred to the spherical shape of the molds, they now come in tiers, melon forms and towering conical shapes. A bombe with a 4- to 5-cup capacity will serve 4 to 8 people, depending on the toppings you use and the appetite of your guests. The cream for the filling should be softened just enough so it can be packed into the mold with the back of a tablespoon. It should not liquefy. If it becomes too soft while you work with it, freeze it again until solid before resuming. Line the mold with a 1″ shell of your first cream. Cover and chill until hardened, then add a second shell of a different-color cream or sherbet. Cover and chill until hardened again. Fill the center hollow with a third color cream or sherbet, or with flavored whipped cream or fruit purée,. Cover and chill until completely set. If you prefer, the mold can be filled in three horizontal bands. Always stand mold, lid side up, in the freezer.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page394"></a>If you do not have a freezer, bury the mold in a pail packed with 3 parts ice to 1 part rock salt.</p>

  <p class="indent">To prevent water from seeping into the bombe, cover cream with a sheet of buttered waxed paper before fixing the lid in place. Then butter the edges of the lid itself. Bury in ice up to the buttered edge of the lid. Freeze 2 or 3 hours, or until hard.</p>

  <p class="indent">To unmold a bombe, dip it, lid side up, in very hot water for a second or two. Dry and remove cover. Loosen edges with a knife and invert onto a chilled serving platter. Garnish with whipped cream and fruit or nuts. To serve, cut in long wedges.</p>

  <p class="indent">A bombe should always be well filled with cream. It is perfectly all right to open the mold when you want to check to see if the cream has frozen to the right consistency.</p>

Rinse the chilled mold and shake out excess water. Turn chocolate filling into mold and place cover on tightly. Place in freezer about 5 or 6 hours, or until filling is solid but still creamy. You should be able to just barely pierce it with a sharp pointed knife.</p>

  <p class="indent">If you wanted to present dinner guests with the dessert most often served on special occasions in Germany, this festive-looking ice cream bombe would be the best [possible choice. Any restaurant that takes itself at all seriously lists it on its menu and German families order whole Pückler bombes from their favorite Konditorei, as a treat to be served at home after Sunday dinner. It was named after Hermann Ludwig Heinrich Pückler, a Silesian soldier and author who received <a id="page399"></a>the title of prince (Fürst) from the king of Prussia in 1822. The prince was both a gourmet and a cook, and this dessert was his invention. With its three layers of chocolate, vanilla and strawberry or raspberry ice cream, it was undoubtedly the inspiration for the chocolate, vanilla and strawberry ice cream bricks that have become standards here.</p>

  <p class="indent">The three flavored creams that make up the layers of this bombe are each prepared separately and added to the mold after the previous layer has set in the freezer. Allow about ½ to 2 hours from the time you begin to prepare it until the mold is finally placed in the freezer. The three fillings can all be made up at once and then added to the mold as each layer freezes; I prefer to make up each filling just before it is needed. For the filling (see below) use a 6-cup metal bombe mold with a very tight-fitting cover. Its general shape should be tall, narrow and straight, or slightly flared out toward the bottom. It may be plain, fluted or tiered. At first glance, you might not think this is enough dessert for 8 to 10 people, but it is extremely rich and one long slim wedge is ample for one person. If you are serving a very light meal and if you have invited guests who have an inordinate taste for sweets, you might have to make a little more of each filling and use an 8-cup mold.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 to 1½ cups coarse macaroon crumbs (18 to 24 small macaroons; they should be small, crisp bitter macaroons, such as the Italian amaretti)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 to 3 tablespoons rum or arrack</em></p>

  <p class="indent">To prepare crumbs, grind macaroons coarsely in a blender or food grinder; or put them in a paper bag, close the bag securely and roll the macaroons with a rolling pin, turning the bag over once or twice so they are evenly crushed. Place crumbs in a bowl and sprinkle with rum or arrack, mixing so that all crumbs are evenly moistened.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Prepare ½ recipe for Chocolate Bombe.</p>

  <h4 class="section" id="heading_id_78"><em>Vanilla Filling:</em></h4>

  <p class="nonindent">Whip 1¼ cups heavy cream and flavor with 1 to 2 teaspoons vanilla and 1 tablespoon confectioners’ sugar. Whip sugar and vanilla into stiffened cream.</p>

  <h4 class="section" id="heading_id_79"><em>Strawberry or Raspberry Filling:</em></h4>

  <p class="nonindent">Whip 1¼ cups heavy cream and when it begins to stiffen, beat in 1 tablespoon confectioners’ sugar. When stiff, fold in 2 tablespoons strawberry or raspberry purée. Make this with fresh berries or by thawing <a id="page400"></a>and draining frozen fruit. Purée in a blender or through a strainer. If you use frozen fruit, you might like a little less sugar, so taste as you go along. To this mixture add a few drops red food coloring and mix through lightly but thoroughly.</p>

  <h4 class="section" id="heading_id_80"><em>To Assemble the Bombe:</em></h4>

  <p class="indent">The mold should be chilled for 1 hour before you start to fill it. Rinse and shake out excess water. Begin by turning the chocolate filling into the mold. Add a ¼″ to ½″ layer of macaroon crumbs. Cover and place in freezer 30 to 40 minutes, or until crumbs are set. Remove mold, uncover and add the vanilla filling and another layer of crumbs. Cover and replace in freezer, again 30 to 40 minutes, or until crumbs have hardened. Remove mold, uncover and fill with raspberry or strawberry cream. If you have crumbs left, and if you would like to, add a third layer after the pink cream. That is not usually done although it makes a nice base. Cover mold and set in freezer 6 to 8 hours, or until ice cream is solid. You should be able to just barely pierce it with a sharp pointed knife.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. If it seems too much trouble to make the chocolate filling, use chocolate-flavored whipped cream instead. Whip 1¼ cups heavy cream, beating in 1 tablespoon confectioners’ sugar as cream stiffens. Stir in ⅓ cup semi-sweet chocolate bits which have been melted over a pan of hot water and then cooled.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. To make this the easy way, mold with ready-made, shghtly softened ice cream. Prepare macaroon crumbs. Buy 1 pint chocolate ice cream, 1 pint vanilla ice cream and 1 pint strawberry ice cream. Chill the mold. Let chocolate ice cream stand at room temperature until just soft enough to be pressed into mold; do not let it turn liquid. Rinse mold and shake out excess water. Fill with softened ice cream, packing it down hard into mold. Sprinkle with macaroon crumbs and chill. When set, let vanilla ice cream soften, pack it into mold, top with another layer of macaroon crumbs, cover and freeze again until set. Follow this procedure with strawberry ice cream. Let completed mold chill 5 to 6 hours.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Weinchaudeau and Weinschaum are closely related, the first being either a sauce or a dessert in itself, while the second is always a sauce. Both are very similar to the Itahan zabaglione. Chaudeau refers to the warm water over which the custard cooks; Schaum refers to the foamy consistency of the finished sauce. The only difference between the two is the amount of egg yolk and cornstarch that is used in the latter.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>6 egg yolks</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>⅓ cup sugar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1½ cups Moselle wine</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">In the top of a large enameled double boiler, beat egg yolks with sugar until thick and pale yellow. Set over bottom pan that is a third full of cold water. Start heating water and keep beating egg yolk and sugar, gradually pouring in white wine. By the time water is simmering, custard should be thick, frothy and hot. Be careful that water does not boil, or egg will stick to pan. Spoon into parfait glasses or whiskey-sour glasses. This can also be served cold. Set pot in bowl of ice and beat until custard is thick and cold. Serve in the same kind of glasses.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Fruit sauces are used a great deal over almost every kind of dessert in Germany—puddings, ice creams, jelled creams, whipped cottage <a id="page407"></a>cheese, rice molds and hot fruit fritters. The sauce may be hot or cold and is almost always made of red fruit or berries such as cherries, raspberries, strawberries or currants. Any of the fruit compotes are served as sauces, hot and cold.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">The simplest fruit sauce is heated sweet red fruit juice that is poured over hot puddings. This may or may not be thickened with cornstarch, depending on the preference of the individual cook. As you can see below, these sauces may be based o<em>n</em> fresh or bottled fruit juices and/or purées or on fruit jams and marmalades.</p>

Stir in dissolved cornstarch, bring to a boil and simmer 2 or 3 minutes, or until sauce is thick and clear. Flavor with lemon juice and wine to taste. If you use fruit purée, from fresh or frozen fruit, cook water and lemon peel and when it is boiling, stir in dissolved cornstarch. Simmer 2 or 3 minutes until thick, then stir in purée and flavor with sugar, lemon juice and wine to taste. Serve hot or cold.</p>
