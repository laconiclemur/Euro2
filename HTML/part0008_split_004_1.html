  <h3 class="h3a">Classic Bolognese ragù</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">Although one of the most popular pasta sauces worldwide, the Bolognese is so often made badly outside of Italy: too much tomato, not cooked for long enough and usually served with spaghetti, hence the term ‘spag bol’ - unheard of in Italy! Because of all these differences and others, the Bolognese association of the <em class="calibre4">Accademia Italiana della Cucina</em> decided in 1982 to declare an official recipe. Although the original recipe used a whole cut of meat which was cut into tiny pieces, the <em class="calibre4">Accademia</em> allows for minced meat for ease of preparation. Only double- or triple-concentrated tomato purée is used (the kind sold in tubes in the supermarket is usually double-concentrated) and the addition of milk towards the end of cooking takes away any acidity from the tomato. The thick meat sauce would fall off the thin strands of spaghetti and so the Bolognese always serve it with tagliatelle; this ragù is also used for lasagne. For a rich, dense sauce, slow-cook for at least 2 hours. It is always worth making more than you need so you can freeze some in batches.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">30g/1oz butter</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 onion, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 celery stalk, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 carrot, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">150g/5½oz pancetta, cubed</p>

  <p class="ing1">200g/7oz minced (ground) beef</p>

  <p class="ing1">200g/7oz minced (ground) pork</p>

  <p class="ing1">200ml/7fl oz/scant 1 cup red wine</p>

  <p class="ing1">1½ tbsp tomato purée (paste)</p>

  <p class="ing1">200ml/7fl oz/scant 1 cup <a href="part0007_split_005.html#pg21" class="calibre1">beef stock</a> – or use a stock cube</p>

  <p class="ing2">100ml/3½fl oz/scant ½ cup full-fat milk</p>

  <p class="para">Heat the olive oil and butter in a large saucepan, add the onion, celery, carrot and pancetta and sweat on a gentle heat for about 10 minutes, until the onion has softened.</p>

  <p class="para">Add the meat and brown all over. Increase the heat, add the wine and allow to evaporate. Dilute the tomato purée in a little of the stock and stir into the meat. Reduce the heat to low, cover with a lid and cook on a gentle heat for 2 hours, checking and adding a little extra stock from time to time to prevent the sauce from drying out.</p>

  <p class="para">About 10 minutes before the end of cooking time, stir in the milk.</p>

  <p class="para">Serve with freshly cooked tagliatelle.</p>

    <p class="box-head">For a slow cooker</p>

    <p class="box-para">Sweat the vegetables and pancetta and brown the meat as above. Add the wine and allow to evaporate, then dilute the tomato purée in 350ml/12fl oz/1½ cups stock, bring to the boil and transfer to a medium slow cooker pot. Cover and cook on Low for 8–9 hours. Stir in the milk and cook for 10 minutes. Serve as above.</p>

    <p class="box-para">For a large slow cooker pot, make double the quantity: cooking times remain the same.</p>
