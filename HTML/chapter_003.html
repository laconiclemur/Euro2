<p class="flush_left_large"><a id="pg_84"/>Sometimes I want to stand on the rooftop and shout: ‘Tapas are not the only Spanish food!’ Outside Spain these snacks are so famous, and tapas bars so fashionable, you could be forgiven for thinking that this is the be all and end all of Spanish eating.</p>
<p class="indented_large">That’s not to say that I don’t love tapas. I do. They represent a relaxed way of sharing food, drink and gossip with friends that is typically Spanish. But it is only one aspect of the way people eat. Also, defining <em>tapas</em> (little snacks) as distinct from <em>raciones</em> (small shared plates) can be quite spurious. The squares of <em>tortilla</em>, saucer of olives, plate of air-dried ham and dish of local beans or wrinkled potatoes in a spicy sauce that you eat with a glass of sherry or a beer, standing or sitting on a stool in a bar, could equally be starters in a restaurant. They could be little plates that you put on the table before the big Sunday meal, or a collection of dishes that make up lunch or a simple supper.</p>
<p class="indented_large">Our good friend, chef and writer, Pep Palau, cooked in a restaurant in Orís in Catalunya for a number of years. It was actually a rectory attached to a church and there were only four other houses in the village. His food was fantastic and one year he put on a spectacular New Year’s Eve dinner with dish after dish leading up to roasted <em>isard</em>, the local name for the Pyrenean chamois, or goat-antelope.</p>
<p class="indented_large">In between each course on the menu, Pep had written the word <em>flostis</em>, which, he explained, was an old-fashioned Catalan word meaning ‘thingamijig’. His delicious selection of <em>flostis</em> included various <em>croquetas</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_241">here</a>); a local farmhouse cheese coated in crushed nuts; <em>sobrasada</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#p260aa">here</a>) and honey toasties, homemade pâtés and sautéd wild mushrooms.</p>
<p class="indented_large">I thought it was a brilliant word, and something about the sound of it conjured up a sense of nostalgia and forgotten language that amused the table and had everyone talking about favourite <em>flostis</em>. Maybe that is what I should have called this chapter, as it is really about a collection of small ‘thingamijigs’ you can group together or serve alone, as you like.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec23"><a id="pg_86"/>Galletas de queso manchego</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Scott’s Manchego cheese biscuits</p>
<p class="flush_left">These beguiling little biscuits with a big flavour make a great <em>aperitivo</em> with <em>cava</em> or extra dry Martinis. The recipe comes from Scott Boden, one of my earliest partners in Brindisa. He makes the biscuits with a variety of Spanish cheeses, but recommends Manchego for the most impact and reckons they are also good without the saffron, if you prefer not to use it. When Rupert and I got married, Scott very generously made around 400 of the biscuits to serve with drinks at the party afterwards, and everyone loved them.</p>
<p class="indented">The biscuits are ready to eat once they are out of the oven and have cooled to room temperature, but are better after a couple of days, kept in an airtight container.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes around 60 biscuits</p>
<p class="ingredients">125g mature Manchego cheese, finely grated</p>
<p class="ingredients">175g strong white flour</p>
<p class="ingredients">6 strands of saffron (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredients">125g unsalted butter, softened</p>
<p class="method">Mix the grated cheese with the flour.</p>
<p class="method">Grind the saffron, if using, very finely using a pestle and mortar, then incorporate into the butter and rub into the flour and cheese.</p>
<p class="method">Form into 3 rolls of 2.5cm in diameter – working the dough as little as possible. Wrap in clingfilm and chill for at least 1 hour in the fridge.</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 160°C/gas 2.</p>
<p class="method">Remove the rolls of dough from the fridge and slice into rounds, 1.5cm thick, then arrange them, well-spaced, on baking trays. Bake in the middle of the preheated oven for around 20 minutes, or until the biscuits are lightly golden brown and the centres are fairly firm to the touch, turning the trays around once during the baking time, so that the biscuits bake evenly.</p>
<p class="method">Remove them from the oven and place on a rack to cool.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec24"><a id="pg_87"/>Almendras al horno o fritas</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Salted roasted or deep-fried almonds</p>
<p class="flush_left">Of course, you can buy wonderful-quality, ready-salted almonds, but it is also pretty satisfying to do your own. In theory, this is one of the easiest <em>aperitivos</em> of all – but you do need about ten minutes of calm and patience in the kitchen – as it is vital to make sure the almonds don’t burn.</p>
<p class="indented">The Spanish will always use the best nuts for serving with drinks. The ultimate almond is the round, fat, rich, buttery Marcona (see <a href="chapter_003.html#p90a">here</a>). These are almost always sold blanched, i.e. out of their skins, and then usually they are fried in olive oil, which gives the nuts a stronger flavour and fabulous crunchy texture – though I also like them oven-roasted, and they feel healthier this way.</p>
<p class="indented">The longer, slender and more brittle Largueta variety of almonds can also be roasted in the same way in or out of their skins (they tend to be more flavoursome this way than deep-fried) and are a touch drier, for times when you don’t want the full-fat creaminess of a Marcona.</p>
<p class="indented">Whichever method you choose, find yourself a good dry sherry to wash down the almonds.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes a good bowlful</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g whole blanched almonds, preferably Marcona</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons olive oil if roasting; 500ml if deep-frying</p>
<p class="ingredients">around 2 teaspoons sea salt, crushed</p>
<p class="method">Have ready a shallow bowl, lined with several pieces of kitchen paper.</p>
<p class="method">For roasted almonds, preheat the oven to 180°C/gas 4 and spread the almonds on a large baking tray. Pour 2 tablespoons of oil over them and gently tilt the tray so it is well lined with oil and all the almonds are coated. Put into the preheated oven for about 10 minutes, making sure you watch carefully and turn the tray if necessary to keep the nuts that are at the edges and the back from getting burnt. Give the tray a gentle shake after about 5 minutes and again after about 8 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Once the nuts are golden in colour, take them out of the oven and tip them into the prepared bowl. Sprinkle with around 2 teaspoons of crushed sea salt and mix well, then cover with more kitchen paper and leave to cool completely. They should be ready to eat in about 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">For deep-fried almonds, heat 500ml of olive oil in a deep pan (making sure it comes no further than a third of the way up). It needs to be around 180°C, but if you don’t have a thermometer, put in an almond and if it sizzles the oil is hot enough. Fry the rest for about 2 minutes (moving them around), then lift out with a slotted spoon into the paper-lined dish. Immediately sprinkle with the salt as before, shake well to distribute it and leave to cool completely.</p>

<p class="square-subhead">‘stone fruit, eaten as nuts’</p>
<p class="flush_left">Something we tend to forget is that almonds are actually stone fruit, eaten as nuts. There are around 200 varieties of almond in the world and many of them are native to Spain, where the acreage of almond trees is over three times that of California, yet the Spanish production is less than half that of the American state, which says a great deal about the different philosophies. In California, production is on a massive, hi-tech scale, with the orchards often being sprayed from the air. In Spain almonds are primarily produced on thousands of small farms on marginal land next to the Mediterranean, where the trees will often share their pockets of territory with olive trees, grapes and occasionally some cereal crops. The main growing areas are around Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida, Castellón de la Plana and Valencia, where the soil tends to be quite poor. Since the land is not often irrigated, the trees rely heavily on rainfall and are very sensitive to weather changes, especially during the flowering season.</p>
<p class="indented">Despite the tough conditions – and perhaps partly because of them – Spanish almonds, particularly the highly prized Marcona, have a natural fattiness that is lacking in their counterparts grown in California, which tend to dry out more quickly and so are less versatile and not ideal for use in Spanish recipes. Inevitably, though, Spanish growers are now experimenting with planting newer, higher-yielding Californian varieties in Spanish soil, with some good results: for example, the Guara produces a good, sweet, round and soft almond.</p>
<p class="indented">Almond harvesting and processing in Spain begins in coastal areas around August and finishes inland around October, depending on the weather and the size of the crop. The almonds are either harvested manually by knocking the fruits from the branches, or by mechanically shaking them. Typically the nuts are left to dry on the ground for about 7–10 days, then swept into heaped rows where a mechanical picker gathers them up and delivers them, stones, soil and all, to the almond seller for shelling, grading, blanching, etc.</p>
<p class="indented">Varieties of Spanish almond vary considerably in flavour, from the buttery creaminess of the Marcona, grown on the Levante coast, to the more brittle nuttiness of the Largueta, grown in inland Aragón. These two are the best known, but older varieties include the Planeta, a sweet and oily almond that is very flat in shape and grows around the Alicante region, but is in danger of disappearing due to droughts; the Mallorca, grown on the island of the same name, and rich in fats, with a mild flavour; and the Comuna, which is usually long and slim but can vary in shape as well as flavour – occasionally you might find a bitter one. You might also come <a id="pg_90"/>across the Ramillete variety from Murcia, which is very sweet and perfect for marzipan, and Esperanza, a very versatile, good-quality almond that can be fried like a Marcona. If you can find it, it is probably the next best to its more famous relation, but again it is limited in production and in danger of disappearing, as the trees yield only a low quantity of fruit.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_89"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg089.jpg"/></div>
<h4 class="c_head" id="p90a">The Marcona almond</h4>
<p class="flush_left">This is the most loved and revered of all almonds and the best known outside Spain. However much growers may experiment with new Californian varieties, it is hard to imagine the Marcona being supplanted as the king. Small, plump, round and pale-coloured, the nuts flourish all along the south-eastern Levante coast, and connoisseurs will buy their nuts from the particular villages that they believe produce the best. The selection of the nuts is crucial, as bees can transfer bitterness from one tree blossom to another. Marconas are graded by their size and proportion, and the best you can buy is a perfectly shaped nut measuring 16mm.</p>
<p class="indented">What makes the almonds special is their high oil content, so they are luscious and aromatic when they are fried and salted and served as an <em>aperitivo</em>. The fat content is also crucial in making <em>turrón</em> (the famous Spanish nougat). As the natural oil comes out of the nuts it helps bind the ingredients, compacting and sticking the elements together without the need for any added fat. One of my fondest food memories is the cosy smell of recently roasted almonds, mashing slowly with warm honey on an autumn morning at the home of <em>turrón</em>-maker Ferran Alemany, in the Lleida hills in Catalunya (see <a href="chapter_001.html#pg_15a">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">Across the regions of Mediterranean Spain Marcona almonds might also be used in cake-making and baking; coarsely chopped into a rice dish; crushed with garlic and parsley in a <em>picada</em> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_320">here</a>); toasted and served with <em>mojama</em> (salted and dried tuna) to give a different, crunchy texture to the cured fish; or made into <em>ajo blanco</em>, the famous cold garlicky almond soup (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_147">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">I’m told that when the almond trees blossom, the flowers point upwards, which is why you can’t grow Marcona almonds further north or inland because the dew that collects inside the petals might freeze overnight, and then the crop of nuts is ruined. That is why in the north and inland areas they favour the Largueta, as its flowers point downwards and the dew can drain away before it freezes.</p>
<p class="recipe-head2" id="reca2"><a id="pg_91"/>MARINATED AND STUFFED OLIVES</p>
<p class="flush_left1">All of the following, except the <em>gilda</em>, make a good bowlful, enough for four people with drinks, to put out with bread before a meal, or as part of a tapas selection.</p>
<p class="indented1">If your olives come in brine, rinse them quickly under running water and dry them, before adding your own marinade.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec25">Aceitunas empeltre con alcaparras</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec26">Aceitunas empeltre con vino y naranja</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Black olives in wine and orange marinade</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 orange</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec27">Aceitunas verdes con naranja y miel</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Green olives with orange zest and honey</p>
<p class="flush_left">This was the idea of James Robinson, my long-time colleague at Brindisa, and a big fan of casual gatherings of friends sharing lots of small plates. His idea was to add some sweetness to the Caspe, which is a bitter olive. Once marinated, these will keep in the fridge for several days.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec28">Aceitunas gordal con anchoa</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Gordal olives with anchovies</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is one of my favourite ways of serving olives, but since we are talking about only two main ingredients, success depends on selecting the best quality olives and anchovies. We use the big, beautiful green ‘queen’ Gordal olives from Andalucía, which because of their size are a real feast for the eyes, stuffed with whole, hearty Cantabrian anchovy fillets, and drizzled with a robust extra virgin olive oil. The result is a world away from industrially produced anchovy-stuffed olives, where the pitted olives are mechanically filled with pulped anchovy paste.</p>
<p class="ingredients1">around 30 large Gordal olives (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_97">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">around 15 best-quality cured anchovy fillets – Cantabrian or Mediterranean if possible (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_122">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 teaspoons chopped marjoram (preferably with flowers) or rosemary</p>
<p class="ingredients">a little good, robust extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="method">Carefully make a slit in each olive lengthways and remove the stone, making sure you don’t break the olive completely in half.</p>
<p class="method">Halve the anchovy fillets lengthways, roll up and gently push one inside each olive. Arrange in a bowl, sprinkle with the chopped marjoram or rosemary and drizzle with oil.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec29">Aceitunas y alcaparras aragonesas</p>

<p class="square-subhead">‘for a long time I searched for the consummate olive’</p>
<p class="flush_left">You can still see small rustic groves of olives dotted around Catalunya and on the hillsides of Mallorca, but these days the harvesting of local crops on a small scale is often only for pure subsistence, or for the romance of it. Small commercial growers frequently fight against tough odds to keep going, while the majority of Spain’s olive production, which is the biggest in the world, is done very professionally on a large scale (mostly in Andalucía), featuring over 250 varieties in many, many different shades and flavours.</p>
<p class="indented">Introduced to Spain by the Romans, the cultivation of olives was developed by the Arabs. Roughly speaking, olives harvested early are green and firm. When they are more mature they turn a more yellowy colour, and when they are allowed to ripen further, they turn ‘black’, a bit wrinkly and shiny with their own oil, which intensifies as the olive matures. In reality there are no olives that are truly ebony-coloured – all mature ‘black’ olives are really a deep purply-brown. When you see the dense, boot-polish black ones that are sold quite cheaply and used on top of pizzas or sometimes chopped in salads, they often seem unreal. That is because they are unreal. They are actually green olives that have been soaked in water with oxygen running through them, an industrial process that is used a great deal around Extremadura and which turns them black. The colour is then fixed with ferrous gluconate, which appears on labels as E579. The argument is that this gives you the firmness of a younger olive, which can be pitted easily, without the pronounced quite bitter and intense olive-y taste of the ripe, naturally cured, ‘black’ fruit. However, the oxygenating process strips the olive of pretty much all its flavour, so that they taste of virtually nothing at all.</p>
<p class="indented">In southern Spain, most particularly around Sevilla, the olives are a yellowy-green colour, the result of steeping them in a caustic soda solution, which is used to turn the bitterness of the olives to sweetness.</p>
<p class="indented">They are drained and refreshed with citric acid, to neutralise the caustic soda. This process manages to penetrate about two-thirds of the flesh and the olives require repeated washing before transferring to barrels, where they are left to ferment in salt water of 8–9 per cent salt.</p>
<p class="indented">By contrast, olives that have been naturally cured really taste of olives and still have a bitterness that we at Brindisa love. However, I have realised that outside Spain this taste is not always to everyone’s liking, initially at least, since people have got used to the neutral character of olives which have been cured with chemicals and added ingredients, and so it often takes time to convince them that this is not what a real olive is about.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_95"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg095.jpg"/></div>
<p class="indented"><a id="pg_96"/>All olives contain oleuropein, which is the compound that gives them their bitterness, but since this is water-soluble, naturally cured olives are initially put into water, which is changed regularly over many days, to draw out the bitterness. Then, as they sweeten up, you can start the cure by adding salt as well as any flavourings, such as wild fennel, to the water.</p>
<p class="indented">I have a romantic idea of curing olives at home, so we have planted two small olive trees in our garden in London, and while I have no illusions that we will be handing out home-cured olives to friends and family, as my sister-in-law does in Catalunya, I look forward to harvesting and attempting to cure even the smallest batch of fruit. The notion gives me a feeling of being part of the long and great history of the olive tree, and, in a very small way, extending the line.</p>
<h4 class="c_head" id="p96a">Green Caspe</h4>
<p class="flush_left">For a long time I searched for the consummate green olive, and finally I found it in Aragón in north-eastern Spain. Caspe olives have the most amazingly clean, sharp, pure olive flavour and a quite crunchy texture, since they are harvested relatively young. They are grown in groves outside the town which gives the fruit their name. We buy them from a family business, Conservas Calanda, run by olive-curer Ismael Coneso and his son, also called Ismael, who specialise in both olives and peaches. The olives are cured and packed in their beautiful old beamed building, which was once a wine warehouse, while the peaches are processed in a modern facility nearby.</p>
<p class="indented">They source their Caspe olives, as well as the black Empeltre (see <a href="chapter_003.html#p97b">here</a>), from their own land and from local families, who are often related to each other or come together in co-operatives, and who have been growing and harvesting the fruit for generations. Typical are the Cardo family. In mid-September the father, Demetrio, now in his eighties, still harvests the lower branches of their 500 or so 40-year- old trees by hand, while his son Ezequiel uses a mechanical shaker for the higher branches.</p>
<p class="indented">The olives drop into tarpaulins under the trees, then they are classified by the local <em>almacenista</em> (storer) before Ismael Coneso Senior cures them in the traditional way in brine (for the Caspe, he adds wild fennel picked from the hillsides), for a minimum of one month. After this they will have acquired a natural shine, and their characteristic crisp, sharp, deep and ‘proper’ olive taste.</p>
<p class="indented">The Caspe is a fragile olive, which needs constant storage temperatures and must remain wholly immersed in brine, otherwise the fruit will discolour. The olives also continue to lose some of their sharpness over time, so that the strong bite of the autumn becomes much softer by the following summer. Sometimes white specks appear on the olives that have thinner skins – this isn’t a fault, but denotes the fruits that are the nicest and juiciest.</p>
<h4 class="c_head"><a id="pg_97"/>Green Gordal Reina (Queen)</h4>
<p class="flush_left">At Brindisa these huge, oval, green Andalusian olives have been the most popular variety ever: their size helps, as they are a real feast for the eyes – a single olive can weigh around 8–12g – and the indent at the stem can sometimes give them a heart-shaped look. But they also deliver in terms of their firm yet juicy texture and the rich, intense flavour that bursts out of them. As with the Caspe olives, a white speckling often appears on the thinnest-skinned, juiciest olives.</p>
<p class="indented">Despite their lusciousness, their oil content is relatively low, so they are rarely pressed for olive oil. Instead they are perfect for curing. We launched our first Brindisa tapas bar with a winning combination that was a favourite of our chef of the time, José Pizarro: pitted Gordal olives, opened up and stuffed with pieces of orange, closed again, then drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with salt and wild, flowering marjoram or dried oregano.</p>
<p class="indented">The substantial nature of the olives also lends them to being speared with a few other ingredients on a cocktail stick, and in the <em>pintxos</em> (local tapas) bars of the Basque country, a typical favourite is the <em>gilda</em> (‘lollipop’, see <a href="chapter_003.html#rec30">here</a>), a combination of a single olive, anchovy and various pickles, which you down in one mouthful.</p>
<h4 class="c_head" id="p97a">Green Manzanilla</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Great dressed with some extra virgin olive oil, crushed garlic and thyme leaves and served with sherry, this is also the perfect Martini olive: fresh and green, firm, crisp and juicy, with a light, sweet flavour. Also from Andalucía, the Manzanilla grows in Pilas and Albaida del Aljarafe, close to Sevilla, and is harvested between September and October. As a tapa, the olive might be served as a <em>banderilla</em>, i.e. wrapped in a <em>boquerón</em> (marinated anchovy fillet, see <a href="chapter_003.html#rec41">here</a>) and speared with a cocktail stick.</p>
<h4 class="c_head" id="p97b">Black Empeltre</h4>
<p class="flush_left">The Coneso family (see <a href="chapter_003.html#p96a">here</a>) also cure aromatic, sweeter, purply-black Empeltre olives, which are not unlike the Greek Kalamata. Most come from their own groves, where they are allowed to mature on the tree until late winter, so their texture is softer than the crunchy Caspe.</p>
<p class="indented">They are harvested between November and February, then cured in brine for a minimum of 6–8 months. Because their flesh clings firmly to the stone, they stay a perfect oval shape: very, very pretty.</p>
<p class="indented">Ismael Coneso Junior also makes the Empeltre olives into a pâté or tapenade, which contains the best fruit and nothing else, unlike many olive pâtés which use a strong preservation process, colouring and herbs or other ingredients, either to mask lesser-quality olives or to add unnecessary dimensions of flavour. Ismael simply washes the ripe olives, leaves them to drain, then removes the stones, before crushing the flesh into the pure pâté, which is allowed to rest overnight so that the rich oil separates out. The excess oil is skimmed off and sold separately, then the pâté is packed, after which it will oxidize and darken a little and the oil that remains will rise to the surface. So before you serve it, you gently mix it back in.</p>
<h2 class="box-head" id="box4"><a id="pg_98"/>The Tapas Tradition</h2>
<p class="flush_left">What really defines a tapa is not the ingredients or recipe, but the cultural aspect, the social occasion in which it is eaten. Traditionally, you go out for tapas, usually in the evening after work and particularly at the end of the week. Typically, you meet at one bar, then move on to another, and another, and until not so long ago many bars would automatically serve a complimentary tapa whenever you ordered a drink, though that is a rarity nowadays. In towns and cities the bars are often clustered together, and in the best places it is first come first served, so you have to fight for your space. That said, tapas are not about fast food on the go: just the opposite. They are about a slowing of time, in which to share conversation and cement friendships over a few drinks and a leisurely procession of snacks.</p>
<p class="indented">There are so many stories about the origins of tapas that I consulted the two grand food-loving, historian sisters, Margarita and Asunción Almela Boix, who, along with other friends in Madrid, are members of the local <em>tertulia</em> (circle of intellectuals, see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_80">here</a>). Margarita, known as Marga, is a literature professor, and Asunción, known as Maicha, is an archaeologist – and according to them the word tapas probably comes from the Gothic <em>tappa</em>, which arrived with the Visigoths, the Germanic tribes who came to Spain in the fifth century. It referred to something that ‘covered or closed’, and the first tapas were probably pieces of cheese or ham used to cover open bottles and serving vessels, to stop any foreign objects falling into them.</p>
<p class="indented">Some popular stories suggest that tapa culture really took off in the thirteenth century when the Castilian King Alfonso the tenth, having been advised by his doctor to take small mouthfuls of food with a glass of restorative wine, passed a law saying that all drinks in inns had to be served with a snack. In seventeenth-century literature, Cervantes’s character Don Quixote, as well as Don Pablos, the swindler in Francisco de Quevedo’s novel <em>El Buscón</em>, talked of certain salty snacks that would need a drink with them. These would have been the likes of olives, almonds and caperberries, which could not be used in themselves as a ‘cover’ but were just placed on a small plate and were not called tapas, but <em>llamativos</em>, in the case of Don Quixote, and <em>avisillos</em> in the case of Don Pablos.</p>
<p class="indented"><a id="pg_99"/>However, the sisters confirmed that tapas as we know them today really evolved in Andalucía around the nineteenth century. Again, there is a popular story that pins the spread of the fashion throughout Spain on a particular royal moment when King Alfonso (the twelfth this time) visited an Andalusian inn. Suddenly gusts of wind started blowing dust through the door, so he asked for a slice of ham or cheese with which to cover his glass of wine.</p>
<p class="indented">Whatever the truth or legend, it is generally accepted that around this time in Andalucía people would gather outside the local bars on hot evenings enjoying a glass of sherry, and to keep away the insects that were attracted to the sweet drinks, they would cover their glasses with little saucers (<em>tapas</em>). It became the custom to add a few olives, almonds, slices of sausage or ham to the saucers, and gradually the idea spread throughout Spain, evolving over the decades.</p>
<p class="indented">Of course, everyone in Spain is an authority not only on the history of tapas, but on the best kind of tapas bar – but with seventeen regions, and who knows how many thousands of bars throughout the country serving tapas from the traditional to the daring and contemporary, there is no one story and no rule book.</p>
<p class="indented">The fun of the best and busiest bars is watching streams of amazing little dishes coming towards you, one after the other – particularly if a bar specialises in the kind of skilfully fried seafood and fish tapas that are quite tricky to do really well at home, because they have to be cooked <em>al momento.</em></p>
<p class="indented">On the other hand, some of my favourite places are little more than tiny tiled rooms that haven’t changed in hundreds of years, in which the locally cured hams hang above you from the ceiling, and with no space for a slicing machine they have to be carved vertically. Apart from the ham, there might be <em>tortilla</em>, olives and salted almonds, and that is all. Or there might be one hot tapa of the day, such as the delicious little bowls of oxtail served along with cold beer, ham and olives that we discovered in the tiniest of bars in the highest village of the Sierra Nevada on a climbing and camping trip.</p>
<p class="indented">Barcelona is famous for its new wave of stylish, often quite elaborate and avant-garde tapas, influenced by Spain’s culinary alchemist Ferran Adrià, but these often sit alongside the city’s <a id="pg_100"/>classic old-style bars, full of soul, like the famous El Xampanyet, on calle Montcada, the same street as the Picasso Museum. The bar is lined with beautiful old tiles and crammed full of jugs, photos and pictures, as well as a good mix of locals and tourists. In its present incarnation it has been in the same family since the 1930s, though they say some kind of bar has been there for centuries. They serve only what you see on the counter: the biggest and best of anchovies, dressed with olive oil in a big bowl ready to be spooned out on to saucers, along with olives, <em>tortilla</em>, cheese, slices of sausage and <em>pan con tomate</em> (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_72">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">Around Spain you might find bars that specialise in <em>montaditos</em> – ingredients ‘mounted’ on pieces of toast or bread (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_131">here</a>) – perhaps a slice of black pudding or pork loin cooked on the <em>plancha</em> (grill plate), with a sliver of roasted green pepper. A very popular tapa is <em>montadito de sobrasada mallorquína y manchego</em>: grilled soft, pâté-like <em>sobrasada</em> sausage (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#p260aa">here</a>), topped with grated Manchego cheese. Simple, yet really tasty.</p>
<p class="indented">By contrast, in bigger bars, there may be long lists of both hot and cold tapas with more substantial big plates to follow. In the most cutting-edge venues, inventive and architectural-looking tapas often give a contemporary twist to classic ingredients and sometimes mix in influences from other cultures such as tempura and sushi, Eastern spices, or – strangely very popular – French Brie. In Madrid I was taken by friends to La Musa de Espronceda, where along with beautiful tapas they celebrate flamenco, story-telling and film. The restaurant is named after Teresa Mancha, who was the muse of the romantic poet José Espronceda and lived in the building until she died in 1839. On the menu the traditional and experimental sit side by side, so that you can order old favourites like garlic mushrooms and <em>croquetas</em> at the same time as the likes of cabbage rolls filled with pork and raspberry.</p>
<p class="indented">Usually tapas reflect the region you are in, and whether it is known more for meat or fish. In Galicia, famous for its seafood, both fresh and conserved, you would expect to find bowls of mussels, and the local speciality of poached <em>pulpo</em> (octopus), sprinkled with oil, infused with paprika, salt and garlic. Or there might be clams and <em>zamburiñas</em> (queen scallops), put on the <em>plancha</em> in their shells until they open up. Then they are brought, sizzling, to the table and served just as they are, with a lemon, olive oil and garlic dressing.</p>
<p class="indented">In central Spain a popular snack with the first beer of early evening is mackerel on the bone (known as <em>chicharro</em>, <em>verdel</em> or <em>caballa)</em>, fried in olive oil and preserved in vinegar and garlic, accompanied by slices of raw sweet young onion and often hard-boiled eggs and fresh red peppers.</p>
<p class="indented">In the Canaries stand-out tapas include pieces of very lightly smoked white cheese made with a blend of sheep’s and goat’s milk, grilled on the plancha in a similar way to the Greek halloumi, or chunks of grilled fish with bowls of the famous green or red sauce, <em>mojo verde</em> or <em>mojo rojo</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#p298a">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented"><a id="pg_101"/>Alicante is famous for its <em>salazones</em> (salt-preserved fish), which are a speciality at La Taberna del Gourmet, owned by María José San Román, a champion of regional foods whom I first met many years ago at a food event. We agreed to spy amicably on each other’s ventures and over the years she has been a great source of local knowledge. Included on her amazing menu of <em>tapas y raciones</em> are <em>mojama</em> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_121">here</a>), <em>huevos de atún</em> (pressed tuna roe), lightly cured and marinated mackerel, and <em>visol</em>, the name in Alicante for a sardine which is salted, only lightly dried, then neatly sliced. María José serves it in her <em>salazón</em> selection with roasted Marcona almonds and a glass of chilled white Catalan Priorat wine. It is exceptionally good, as the flesh, with its tones of blue, yellow and grey, retains its oily texture and the flavour is relatively mild, not unlike an unpressed anchovy.</p>
<p class="indented">In the Basque region the name for tapas is <em>pintxos</em>, and the bars there often have wonderful baroque displays. In the busiest ones the hot plates fly out of the kitchen to the bar and the food is devoured in seconds. I would always go for the freshly grilled <em>pintxos</em> straight from the <em>plancha:</em> prawns, green Basque <em>guindilla</em> peppers, and doorstep slices of beef, grilled very, very rare, then thickly sliced, along with <em>gildas</em>, ‘lollipop’ tapas on a stick, typically consisting of little pickles, chilli and anchovy (see <a href="chapter_003.html#rec28">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">Ultimately, wherever you are, it is the quality of the ingredients that makes or breaks a tapas bar. No one wants to be served <em>boquerones</em> (marinated anchovies) so vinegary they bring tears to your eyes, Russian salad turning crusty, or meatballs that have been congealing under lights on the counter for hours. The best and busiest bars are constantly feeding people, so the tapas are always freshly prepared to order, and in these, you can eat food that is truly sublime.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_102"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg102.jpg"/></div>
<p class="flush_left_large"><a id="pg_103"/>Since tapas and relaxation are supposed to go hand in hand, the important thing, if you are making tapas at home, is to keep things simple and make good use of cold ingredients. Trying to produce half a dozen hot snacks simultaneously, without a kitchen brigade of helpers, can be stressful – just ask my husband. When I took maternity leave before our son Dominic was born, he decided to do a tapas party for everyone from Brindisa at our house, using an amazing old book of recipes from the Basque region which had pictures and instructions for every conceivable style and shape of tapa, from classics to the kind of elaborate concoctions that edged into the world of seventies<em>’</em> <em>hors d’oeuvres.</em></p>
<p class="indented_large">I was instructed to do nothing while Rupert ran around madly doing intricate things like mixing salt cod with béchamel sauce, then stuffing the mixture into tiny red peppers, dipping them in batter and deep-frying them. It was a huge success and Rupert was very pleased with himself at the end of it all, but he said it was like cooking six entirely different three-course meals, only for people to devour everything in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p class="indented_large">So, I would say stick to just a few things that need cooking, and for the rest, do as everyone in Spain does as a matter of course, which is to make good use of excellent quality cured hams, sausages, chorizo and cheeses, together with vegetables, peppers and fish prepared by artisans and packed into jars and cans. If you go to a friend’s house in Spain, they will invariably offer you a glass of wine or sherry <a id="pg_104"/>and whichever of these foods they happen to have, with no adornment, because none is considered necessary.</p>
<p class="indented_large">When we visit our friends Ambro and Asun in Burgos, in Castilla y León, as a prelude to Ambro’s famous Sunday lunch of <em>bacalao</em> (salt cod) <em>al pil pil</em> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_332">here</a>), Asun will put out a wonderful selection of small dishes, which always involves something from the profusion of jars and pots of home conserves she keeps in her store cupboard, such as peppers under oil or tomato, onion and pepper jams.</p>
<p class="indented_large">White asparagus is a favourite ingredient, highly prized because it is very tender, juicy and subtle in flavour; however, it is rarely sold fresh in Spain, as the local growing season is short, so it is almost always canned or jarred. White asparagus imported from places such as Peru and China is also canned in Spain, which massively undercuts the local product, but the spears tend to be more stringy, less juicy and relatively flavourless. Spanish asparagus is grown to different sizes, but the bigger and fatter the better – in fact, the giant spears prepared by Conservas Navarrico in Navarra are labelled <em>cojonudos</em>, which is the colloquial expression for something awesome and ballsy.</p>

<p class="recipe-head2" id="recb2"><a id="pg_106"/>PESCADOS Y MARISCOS EN CONSERVA</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead1">Conserved fish and shellfish</p>
<p class="flush_left">Spain has a long and rich heritage of fish and seafood, conserved either in salt (<em>salazón</em>), oil, or by cooking and storing in a vinegar and spice marinade (<em>escabeche</em>), which, chosen well, makes for outstanding small plates.</p>
<p class="indented">I know that not everyone will be convinced to pay a premium for a tin of fat Cantabrian anchovies, Galician clams from the Rías Gallegas (the local estuaries), or luscious <em>bonito del norte</em> from the Bay of Biscay, but I can honestly say that discovering how good fish in tins can taste has been a life-enhancing experience not only for me, but for the very many Brindisa customers and curious chefs who have come to understand and appreciate its luxurious nature.</p>
<p class="indented">Some of the best conserved fish is produced by small and medium-sized, usually family-run, businesses such as Conservas Ortiz, now in their fifth generation and still run by three brothers. The family began preserving fish in the days when it was impossible to send it fresh to cities such as Madrid, and so they started putting sea bream in barrels of ‘spoiled’ vinegary white wine – the beginnings of the <em>escabeche</em> recipe that is still used for their tinned tuna and mackerel.</p>
<p class="indented">Similarly, Conservas Nardín are now in their fourth generation and run by daughter Milagros and her husband, Sebastián. The company was begun in the small Basque fishing village of Getaria at the beginning of the twentieth century by Leonardo Oliveri, one of many Sicilians who settled in the area. At that time, the local Basque people tended only to fry anchovies, or use them as livebait when fishing, whereas the Sicilians prized these little fish and were skilled at salting them. Leonardo found that the ones that could be caught in the colder seas of this northern coast were big and fatty and so perfect for this form of preserving.</p>
<p class="indented">The great beauty of the notion of conserved fish, both gastronomically and ethically, is that you can capture the best local fish in season, obeying the fishing regulations which govern licences and monitor and control the volumes and sizes of fish caught in order to preserve the long-term populations, particularly of <a id="pg_107"/>endangered species. Then you have the luxury of making the fish last as long as you like, so you can eat it whenever and wherever you please.</p>
<p class="indented">Of course, that is the ideal. The reality is that we sometimes forget that conserved fish begins with a fresh product. We expect to see tins on the shelves all year round, irrespective of the fact that the quantity and quality of fish and shellfish available for conserving is very volatile. As always, fishermen are at the mercy of whatever the oceans can provide. In lean times, therefore, producers of canned fish must decide whether to accept fish taken from other seas, often far away and possibly of lesser quality, to satisfy demand; or do as many small, select operations do, and stick rigidly to a policy of only using locally caught fish. Often there is no indication on the can – but the best clue is in the price. Exceptional, locally caught conserved fish will always be more expensive.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec31">Conservas en ‘hojalata’</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Fish presented in tins</p>
<p class="flush_left">Our first menu back in 2004 at London Bridge had a section called ‘fine fish from a tin’ – though I had actually wanted to call it ‘fish <em>in hojalata</em>’, as I have always loved the sound of the word <em>hojalata</em>, which means tin can. Instead of arranging Ortiz Cantabrian anchovies on plates, we served them in their colourful, elegant tins with the tops rolled back, surrounded by piles of brown toast, with unsalted butter and finely sliced shallots. It was an idea that was ahead of its time and not really understood, but I wanted to emphasise the quality and sheer breadth of choice of the preserved fish from Spain, as opposed to fresh seafood. Eventually the fish in tin cans evolved into plates of different conserved fish with fruit, nuts and olives (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_117">here</a>), but recently we decided that it would be fun to revisit the idea of presenting anchovies and other seafood, using their tins as serving ‘dishes’.</p>
<p class="indented">Because the seafood is so rich and concentrated in flavour, a small tin is fine for two people with added ingredients. Of course, when you take out the fish and combine it with these, the mixture won’t necessarily all fit back into the tin, so just mound the rest alongside or serve it separately in a small bowl. I think if you are feeding more people it is fun to put out a selection of different <em>hojalatas</em> and let people help themselves.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">All of the following recipes are for two.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec32"><a id="pg_108"/>Filetes de anchoa con pan tostado</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Anchovies with shallots and buttered toast</p>
<p class="flush_left">For long, fat anchovies, the ultimate tin to buy is the 78g tin from Ortiz. Remove the anchovies, then rinse out the tin and dry it well before putting the fillets back in, so that the fishy oil does not take over the combination of flavours. Finely chop 1 shallot, along with some parsley and chervil. Mix together and sprinkle over the fillets. Put the tin on a big plate with a stack of buttered toast alongside on which to arrange the anchovies.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec33">Filetes de anchoa con escalivada</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Anchovies with roasted vegetables</p>
<p class="flush_left">Again the 78g tin of Ortiz anchovies is perfect. In Spain many people have homemade <em>escalivada</em> – roasted vegetables in vinaigrette (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_284">here</a>) – permanently in their fridge, so it is a very easy thing to combine them with anchovies, which pair really well with the sweet juiciness of the vegetables. However, you can make a quick version by slicing half a red pepper and a small aubergine quite thickly, drizzling with oil and grilling the slices until the pepper is charred and the aubergine browned. An even simpler alternative is to use some jarred <em>piquillo</em> or <em>bierzo</em> peppers (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_275a">here</a>), together with jarred grilled slices of aubergine.</p>
<p class="indented">Cut the vegetables into strips roughly the size of the anchovies, then dress lightly with Cabernet Sauvignon vinegar or another good red wine vinegar (if you are using jarred vegetables, you could add some of the conserving juices). Layer up the dressed vegetables with the anchovies in the tin, as far as you can, and arrange the remainder neatly alongside.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_109"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg109.jpg"/></div>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec34">Anchoas con ensalada de remolacha</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Smoked anchovy fillets with beetroot</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is based on a recipe from Mark Hix’s book <em>Fish etc</em>. Ideally, use smoked anchovies from Conservas Nardín (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_106">here</a>). Mark marinates the anchovies in the fridge for 24 hours, which of course doesn’t make it a quick snack – but 4 hours is fine.</p>
<p class="indented">Take the anchovy fillets out of a 100g tin and put into a bowl. Wash out the tin and dry it. Make a marinade by mixing together 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, 1 teaspoon of Moscatel vinegar, 1 finely chopped clove of garlic, 50ml of olive oil, ½ tablespoon of sea salt and some freshly ground black pepper, and pour over the anchovies. Leave in the fridge for 4–24 hours (see <a href="chapter_003.html#rec34">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">Boil 2 medium raw beetroots in their skins in salted water until just tender (about 1 hour), then peel them while still warm and cut into squares of about 0.5cm. Keep to one side. Lift the anchovies out of their marinade and dry them, then layer them up with the beetroot in the tin, as far as you can, arranging the remainder alongside. Discard the marinade, as you want the zing of a fresh-tasting dressing. Make this using 1 finely chopped shallot, 1 teaspoon of chopped chives, 1 teaspoon of white wine vinegar and 2 tablespoons of olive oil and pour it over the layered anchovies and beetroot.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec35"><a id="pg_110"/>Verdel ahumado con ensaladilla</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Smoked mackerel with potato salad</p>
<p class="flush_left">We use tins of smoked mackerel produced to quite a secret method by the Nardín family in the Basque country for this. The fish is quite special, pale-looking, and tender in texture, more like the raw fish used in sushi.</p>
<p class="indented">For one 100g tin of smoked mackerel, boil 150g new or salad potatoes in salted water, drain them and refresh under cold water. Halve or quarter according to size, then put into a bowl, mix with 1 tablespoon of good mayonnaise, 1 teaspoon grain mustard and 10 small capers (soaked in water for an hour to remove the excess salt and drained), and season with sea salt and black pepper. Arrange the potato salad next to the open tin of mackerel.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec36">Navajas con chorizo y habitas razor clams</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Razor clams with <em>chorizo</em> and broad beans</p>
<p class="flush_left">Mark Hix likes to use the irresistible combination of <em>chorizo</em> with razor clams and this recipe is another from his book, <em>Fish etc.</em> While he cooks fresh razor clams, tinned ones work equally well, and we have adapted his recipe to serve from the tin. It is best to use baby broad beans when you can, as they look more elegant than big ones, and their bright green colour contrasts well with the whiteness of the razor clams (to get the same effect with large beans you would need to slip off their skins once they are cooked).</p>
<p class="indented">The Galician razor clams we buy have been selected when they are at their most tender, and are packed into tins by hand, doused in lemon-and bay-infused spring water. Because they are so delicately flavoured, our chefs prefer to use a mild <em>chorizo</em> which won’t overpower them.</p>
<p class="indented">Remove the razor clams from a 118g tin, drain the brine to use later, then clean the tin, dry it and return the clams. Cook 50g of broad beans in boiling water for 2 minutes, then drain and rinse under cold water to stop them cooking further. Keep to one side.</p>
<p class="indented">Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a small frying pan, add 30g of mild cooking <em>chorizo</em> (cut into £1 coin slices and then into quarters) and cook on a low heat until softened and browned on the edges. Drain the oil from the pan and discard. Add 2 tablespoons of the reserved clam brine. Bring to the boil, then add the reserved beans and heat through for 2 minutes over a medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of chopped parsley, stir through for another minute, then add 10g of cold butter, straight from the fridge. Stir quickly to emulsify the sauce, then taste and season as necessary.</p>
<p class="indented">Spoon the <em>chorizo</em> and bean mixture over the clams in their tin – if you can’t fit it all in, mound some alongside – and serve.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec37"><a id="pg_111"/>Mejillones en escabeche con picadillo de piparra</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead"><em>Escabeche</em> mussels with tomato and red pepper salad</p>
<p class="flush_left">It might sound strange, I know, but these are brilliant served with really good, thin, olive oil-fried crisps, which give a great salty, crunchy contrast to the tender mussels.</p>
<p class="indented">The combination was introduced to me by our friend Raul Domingo, an excellent cook who lives in Madrid with his wife, Carmen. I was working away on this book at their home, when Raúl brought me a tray with a glass of wine on it, a plate of potato crisps as thin as butterfly wings, and a bowl of the mussels. He told me this was a favourite Madrid tapa – you topped a crisp with a mussel and downed it in one – and it was a glorious pick-me-up.</p>
<p class="indented">The plump, golden, almost orange mussels of the Galician region are farmed, but nourish themselves on sea water as they cling to the ropes of the wooden platforms (<em>bateas)</em> in the Arosa inlet, near the O Grove peninsula. They are harvested between July and February and, as with most shellfish, the bigger the better. The largest can measure over 4cm long and 1.5cm wide and the best will go to be canned as <em>mejillones en escabeche</em>. They are first fried in olive oil before being put into the marinade, which includes vinegar, oil, paprika, bay leaves, peppers and cloves.</p>
<p class="indented">To add a touch of freshness and colour, drain the mussels from their tin, keeping the marinade to one side. Finely chop 1 medium ripe tomato or 2 cherry tomatoes, ¼ medium red pepper and the white of a spring onion and mix into the marinade. Put the mussels back into the tin, and spoon the marinade over the top. Serve with good crisps.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec38">Berberechos aliñados</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Dressed cockles</p>
<p class="flush_left">In Vilassar de Mar, just north of Barcelona, there is a famous taverna, the Espinaler, which has been in the same family since it was founded in 1896. In the 1940s they made a name for themselves by selling glasses of <em>vermut</em> (vermouth) in addition to wine, then in the 1990s they expanded into seafood, travelling to Galicia to select the finest, which is canned under their own label. Cockles in salsa and a <em>vermut</em> became a typical midday snack after Sunday Mass.</p>
<p class="indented">The combination was a novelty at the time, but <em>vermuterías –</em> bars serving vermouth and small tapas, especially conserved fish – have since become very fashionable in Barcelona. However, people still commute from the city to the Espinaler to eat their cockles, razor clams, mussels and squid at the bar, as well as buying tins to take away.</p>
<p class="indented">Cockles have a delicate flavour, so you have to be careful not to overpower them, and our executive chef, Josep, makes a light, fresh salsa using the brine from the can, mixed with extra virgin olive oil, sherry vinegar, lemon juice and mild paprika. The result is absolutely delicious, and the title of ‘dressed cockles’ really can’t convey the quintessentially Mediterranean freshness of the flavours, especially when served with a glass of chilled <em>fino</em> sherry or vermouth.</p>
<p class="indented">Open a 112g tin of cockles in brine and place a spatula over the fish so that you can drain the brine into a bowl, leaving the beautifully arranged cockles in place. Keep the brine to one side. To make the dressing, combine 1½ tablespoons of a good, well-balanced extra virgin olive oil such as Arbequina with ½ tablespoon of smooth sherry or Moscatel vinegar, 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, 1½ teaspoons of the reserved brine, and ½ teaspoon of <em>piment</em>ó<em>n dulce</em> (mild paprika) and pour this over the cockles in their tin. Serve with good bread to dip into the dressing at the end.</p>
<h2 class="box-head" id="box5"><a id="pg_112"/>Seafood Saints and Witches</h2>
<p class="flush_left">When my Galician friends and colleagues get together to swap tales from home, the talk inevitably turns to old stories of the sea, the wonders of the local seafood and the perils of searching for <em>percebe</em>s – the weird, strangely beautiful ‘goose’ barnacles that are found clinging to some of the most precarious rocks around the coastline – and witches! Galicians love to talk about the mysticism of their homeland, which has a unique historical mix of the magic practised by its early pagan inhabitants and the later Catholic religion, so witches and saints are both paid homage in the region’s festivals. And it is true there is a spookiness sometimes in the narrow valleys and misty forests which becomes even more eerie when, as is traditional during festivals, the bagpipes are played.</p>
<p class="indented">The legend of the <em>meiga</em>, the good witch, is still strong. Most likely this was really the wise woman of the community who made healing potions, but the <em>meiga</em> is still called upon to bring good luck, watch over fishermen, ensure a good harvest, and help families not to fall out with each other. If the fishermen don’t come back, or the crops fail, there is still a generation who will blame the evil spirits.</p>
<p class="indented">Equally, there are festivals appealing to the saints or the Virgin of the Sea for the same kind of help and good fortune that is asked of the <em>meiga</em>. On 16 July Galicians celebrate the feast of Virxe do Carme (Our Lady of Mount Carmel), one of the many advocations of the Virgin Mary, protector of fishermen and the local navy, with processions of boats, and flowers thrown into the water for all those who have been taken by the sea. The King of Spain often attends the procession and celebrations at the naval base and school in Marín, during which officers carry a statue of the Virgin from the church to the boats.</p>
<p class="indented">One of Galicia’s most magical nights of the year is 23 June, when the tradition is for everyone to go down to the beach, where each group of family and friends will light a fire and heat up <em>la pota da queimada,</em> a three-legged clay pot of moonshine, or ‘witches’ brew’, made with <em>caña blanca,</em> a clear spirit distilled from wine (known elsewhere in Spain as <em>orujo</em> or <em>aguardiente</em>), to which you add lemon and orange peel, coffee beans and sugar. (There are other <em>cañas</em>, such as <em>caña de hierbas</em>, flavoured with herbs, and <em>caña tostada,</em> which has caramelised sugar added to it, but these are traditionally drunk by fishermen to keep them warm as they put to sea.</p>
<p class="indented"><a id="pg_113"/>As the alcohol begins to burn from the heat of the fire, some of the drink is lifted high up with a big ladle and then poured slowly back into the pot, creating a streaming blue flame, while everyone chants the <em>conxuro de queimada</em>, the spell to ward off witches and evil spirits. The brew is poured into clay cups and everyone drinks and dances around the fire while sardines are barbecued and the bagpipes are played. Then at the end of the night, when the fire has died down to embers, everyone has to jump over it in a final gesture of defiance against the witches.</p>
<p class="indented">Personally, when I think of Galicia, it is seafood, rather than witches, that comes to mind, since the Costa do Marisco (shellfish coast) stretches all the way around three of its four provinces and the famous Rías Gallegas offer a unique environment in which Atlantic sea water meets river and rain water in a series of estuaries, which provide one of the richest environments possible for seafood, so crustaceans, molluscs, cephalopods and fish all grow and thrive here, especially in the months of high rainfall.</p>
<p class="indented">Local restaurants are known for the <em>mariscada</em>: big displays of seafood from mussels to oysters and crab, prawns, langoustines, <em>percebes</em> and lobsters, which pair beautifully with the local white wines such as Albariño, Godello or the headier Ribeiro, which you traditionally drink out of white ceramic bowls.</p>
<p class="indented">In olden days the <em>marisqueo,</em> the mollusc harvest, was a purely seasonal event. The <em>veda</em> or ‘campaign’ was declared open on the first full moon at the end of summer, and as soon as the tide was low, often as early as four in the morning, whole families, young and old, would pile on to the beach in the cold and dark, buckets in hand and small rakes at the ready, to reap the bounty of <em>berberechos</em> (cockles) which live in the shallow sands.</p>
<p class="indented">Nowadays, however, most molluscs are seeded, and can be harvested almost all year round, although they will have their optimum moments and quotas are strictly controlled.</p>
<p class="indented">Cockles are still collected by hand, mainly by women. Also in the sand, but in somewhat deeper water, you find <em>almejas</em> (clams). Harvesting of these is done with a boat. Razor clams need a depth of water of about ten metres, and are collected by divers throughout most of the year. Their quality and size can vary depending on where they grow. In the more sheltered waters of the Rías they will <a id="pg_114"/>be more delicate in flavour and texture than those that grow in the more open and wilder waters of the Finisterre peninsula.</p>
<p class="indented">Once harvested the shellfish go to the local auction houses, the <em>lonxas</em>, where some will be sold fresh, and those of the right variety, condition and price go for the delicate work of conserving. While for Galicians fresh fish and seafood is the ultimate, for quick tapas and snacks at home they will always have a store of the highest-quality local seafood conserved in cans or jars.</p>
<p class="indented">Around the coastline you will inevitably hear stories of brave locals who have battled treacherous waves to prise a haul of <em>percebes</em>. Pinky red and black, with pale green, dragon-like, pointy claws that shimmer like mother of pearl in the light, they look like crazy pieces of jewellery.</p>
<p class="indented">Although some can be accessed by land at low tide (the mother of one of our Galician colleagues at Brindisa used to regularly collect them in this way), sometimes you have to knot your rope to a safe rock and lower yourself down the cliffside to reach them, which is physically demanding and slippery, and there are many tales of tragic accidents. Other <em>percebes</em> can only be reached from the sea by swimmers (<em>percebeiros)</em>, who dive from boats and head through the thrashing waters towards the cliffs to cut them away from the rocks. Inevitably the best, shorter, fatter, juicier and pricy barnacles are the ones that have had to grow strong in the wildest waters, and to reach them you need a deep understanding of the sea, its tides and wave patterns to avoid being slammed against the sharp rocks. As the locals say, <em>el mar es un toro, no te puedes fiar</em>: ‘the sea is like a bull; you cannot trust it for a moment’.</p>
<p class="indented">In past times Galician foragers risked life and limb, without even wearing wetsuits, to gather <em>percebes</em> to stave off hunger – perhaps to add to a tortilla, to make it stretch further – or to sell for a few hundred pesetas per kilo, but the barnacles are now considered a great and expensive delicacy on the tapas menus of smart restaurants and bars. They are most popular at Christmas time, when they can grow to 5cm long and up to 1cm wide, and since inevitably the best <em>percebes</em> are becoming scarce, smart restaurants in Madrid and Barcelona will pay hundreds of euros per kilo. It is very similar to the oyster story in Britain, where once there was such a profusion of oysters in the Thames that Londoners packed them into meat pies to help them to go further, whereas now they are a luxury.</p>
<p class="indented">These days, also, the collection of <em>percebes</em> is much more regulated. To be a <em>percebeiro/a</em> you need to have one of a limited number of licences issued by the regional government. You must also comply with quotas which specify a maximum catch and minimum sizes of barnacles in certain areas and during specific times, in order to protect stocks. The <em>percebes</em> must then be auctioned at the <em>lonxa</em>, the auction house run by the <em>cofradía</em>, a society of locals who make sure everyone complies with the licences.</p>
<p class="indented"><a id="pg_115"/>As with most exquisite seafood, little needs to be done to prepare the <em>percebes</em>. Traditionally, they are cooked for just 30 seconds in boiling sea water (or for a maximum of 1 minute in plain water with ‘a fist and a half’ of salt added to every 2 litres of water to mimic the sea), plus a bay leaf or two, then drained and wrapped in a clean cloth, as they will be very hot. To eat, you grasp a <em>percebe</em> at each end and twist it, peel and tear away the leathery reptile-like skin and bite and suck out the flesh from the inner tube. The taste and aroma is of pure sea: there is no other way to describe it.</p>

<p class="recipe-head2" id="reca3"><a id="pg_117"/>EASY CONSERVED FISH COMBINATIONS</p>
<p class="flush_left1">Our special plates combining cured fish, such as mackerel, <em>boquerones</em> (marinated anchovies), small sardines and <em>mojama</em> (tuna loin), each paired with a fruit, nuts or olives, have become a signature of the Brindisa tapas bars. They make the easiest of starters, requiring little or no preparation, as they simply rely on the quality of the seafood, and the various combinations of flavours.</p>
<p class="indented">The pairings that we like best are as follows – we usually serve four different types of fish with their partners – but you could just focus on one or two. Add a mound of fresh toast and some soft herbs, such as parsley and chervil, for scattering over the top.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">Smoked mackerel with sliced green apple (skin on) – the quite fleshy, oily fish goes really well with the sharp, crisp apple.</p>
<p class="flush_left1"><em>Boquerones</em> (marinated anchovies, see <a href="chapter_003.html#rec41">here</a>) with Manzanilla olives. What you are looking for is a good contrast between the mellow vinegariness of the tender marinated anchovies and the salty, fruity crunch of the olives. So beware of the kind of ferociously sharp, vinegary <em>boquerones</em> that you sometimes find in supermarkets. If necessary, drain off the marinade and make your own, with just a few drops of good vinegar and a light olive oil – light is always best with fish so as not to overwhelm it. A little chopped garlic and parsley scattered over the top can be good too.</p>
<p class="flush_left1"><em>Mojama</em> (cured tuna, see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_121">here</a>) with sliced fresh pears. <em>Mojama</em> has a dry texture and quite a fishy, savoury taste, so you need really fresh, sweet, juicy pears to go with it: not hard, woody ones. Ideally, slice the <em>mojama</em> as thinly as you can (about 1mm), then marinate it briefly in olive oil. Mango and pineapple also go well with <em>mojama</em>, as do whole or chopped and roasted almonds.</p>
<p class="flush_left1"><em>Sardinillas</em> (small sardines) with good tomatoes and chopped parsley – the sweet and sour of the tomatoes cuts through the oiliness of the sardines.</p>
<p class="flush_left1"><em>Bonito ventresca</em> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_118">here</a>) with jarred <em>piquillo</em> peppers (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_275a">here</a>). Fry the peppers very briefly in garlic and olive oil, to bring out the flavour and juice. Top with some <em>ventresca</em> and drizzle with a little PX vinegar (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_188">here</a>). The intense, slightly smoky, fruity flavour and the thinness of the pepper are very good with the silky, subtle <em>bonito</em>.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">Razor clams with lemon zest and some lemon juice squeezed into the brine, served with <em>encurtidos</em> (pickles) such as pickled garlic or green pickled <em>guindilla</em> peppers (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_275">here</a>). The quite neutral flavour of the clams is really enhanced by the vinegariness of the pickles.</p>
<p class="flush_left1"><em>Huevas de atún</em> (pressed tuna roe, see <a href="chapter_003.html#p120a">here</a>) with <em>frutos secos</em> (a selection of unsalted skin-on almonds and dried fruit, such as apricots and dried peach halves (<em>orejones</em>), soft fruit such as strawberries; or tomatoes, dressed with a little balsamic or PX vinegar (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_188">here</a>).</p>
<p class="flush_left1"><em>Hueva de verdel</em> (mackerel roe) with radishes and tomatoes. Mackerel roe has a very delicate flavour. We buy our tins from the Nardín family, who pack it with <em>guindilla</em> peppers in olive oil, seasoned with salt and pepper, so you need to add very little dressing, otherwise you will overpower it. Arrange some cherry tomato slices (about 10 tomatoes to one 95g tin of roe) in a circle on a plate with some thinly sliced radishes on top (about 3 radishes will do it). Carefully lift the roe from its tin, gently break it into pieces of about 1cm, and scatter these over the top. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of chopped parsley, 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil, and about ½ teaspoon of Moscatel vinegar. Finish with a twist of salt and pepper.</p>

<p class="square-subhead">‘a largely forgotten art’</p>
<p class="flush_left">In the tapas bars and restaurants of the coastline that runs from Alicante to Cádiz you will usually see <em>salazones</em> on the menu. The process of curing and drying various fish, along with their roe and other tripe, to give them longer life and enhanced flavour, is very much a skill that is associated with this stretch of coast, and apart from <em>mojama</em> (salted and dried tuna loin, see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_121">here</a>) and <em>huevas de atún</em> (pressed tuna roe), most <em>salazones</em> have not travelled much further into Spain than this stretch of coast. So they have become a largely forgotten art.</p>
<p class="indented">I first came across them when I met María José San Román (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_101">here</a>), who invited me to Alicante to see her incredible tapas bar and restaurant where she served salted fish, rice dishes and vegetables in abundance along with superb wines of the region: Moscatels and the famous Fondillon. She advised me to visit a unique shop in the city market owned by Vicente Leal, who is the fourth generation of his family business. It was a mysterious and curious place that felt like the belly of a ship, with pieces of fish hanging from bars and a strong deep-sea aroma lingering in the air. On the counter there were dark-coloured dried octopus and tuna intestines contrasting with the whiteness of salt cod. Ever since that visit I have been fascinated by the history and skills involved in salting and drying fish.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Salazones</h4>
<p class="flush_left">These have a strong flavour so you don’t need large quantities of them. They are typically sliced thinly (about 2–3mm), drizzled with olive oil and served on baked savoury biscuits with tomatoes, or with some almonds and/or dried fruit and a selection of other small plates, salads, fresh cheese and fresh or pickled vegetables. We present them in this way in combination with other conserved fish, and they are very popular, albeit with a relatively limited audience.</p>
<p class="indented">Around 80 per cent of <em>salazón</em> production involves tuna. The cure can be dry <em>(salazón seco salado)</em> or wet <em>(salazón húmedo</em>). Dry-curing simply involves washing and then drying either in natural air or adapted chambers. Wet-salting involves either an initial soaking in brine, followed by air-drying; or a longer cure, in which the fish is covered in salt over a few months, before being washed, dried and then stored under oil.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Ventresca salada</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Also known as <em>ijada de atún</em> or <em>tronco de atún en salazón</em>, <em>ventresca salada</em> is the belly or flank of either the bluefin or the yellowfin tuna, which is wet-salted whole for 2–3 months in a similar way to salt cod, then filleted, washed, dried off and placed in olive oil. It is one of the most delicate <a id="pg_120"/>preparations I have ever savoured, on its own or in a salad. Silky and tender, with a pronounced, but refined flavour of tuna, it melts in the mouth. In the Alicante region it is favoured on the feast of San Juan, on 24 July, and is famously made into <em>coca amb tonyina,</em> a kind of pie made with <em>coca</em> dough sweetened with <em>anís</em>, filled with the cured tuna and a generous amount of slow-cooked onion and pine nuts, which is served with fresh summer figs.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_119"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg119.jpg"/></div>
<h4 class="c_head" id="p120a">Huevas</h4>
<p class="flush_left"><em>Huevas</em>, or roe, is salted and pressed and is similar to the Italian <em>bottarga</em>, and though most comes from bluefin tuna, the roe from yellowfin tuna, as well as other fish, such as sea bass, ling, hake and mullet, is also sought after along the southern and eastern coast of Spain. The roes can often be quite an acquired taste – though I think they are delicious sliced thinly and eaten in salads, with tomatoes or fresh fruit.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Buche</h4>
<p class="flush_left">This is salted tuna tripe, an old-fashioned preparation that is less popular nowadays, and fewer people know how to use it. The stomach of the tuna is salted in the same way as the belly, but only for a number of weeks. It is sold salted and you need to wash it well with water before using it in stews and dishes that require long cooking, such as <em>buche de atún con cebolla</em> (tuna tripe with onions and potatoes), as the texture will only soften properly with heat and time.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Bonito seco</h4>
<p class="flush_left">This comes from a small species of <em>bonito</em> that is caught in the Gibraltar Strait, to which a small part of <em>salaz</em>ó<em>n</em> production (only about 5 per cent) is devoted. It is filleted and salted for 24 hours, then dried for four days in a chamber with natural airflow, and a full slice will only be the size of a small sardine. It has a strong flavour, more of the fish than of the sea, and the flesh darkens to mahogany as it cures. It is eaten on its own and if you can find it I would suggest a dry sherry or a beer to accompany it.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Sarda</h4>
<p class="flush_left"><em>Sarda</em> is something that I only discovered when I was looking for specialities for the coastal menu at our restaurant in Shoreditch. Somewhat confusingly it is called <em>albacora</em> in Castilian, certainly in the southern area of Andalucía, and it looks a little like a small tuna; however, it is not from the same family<em>.</em> It is fished along the coast of Cádiz and Gibraltar and cured in a similar way to anchovies. It is first filleted, then pressed and cured under salt for 3 months before being preserved in oil ready for serving as an outstanding tapa.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Mojama</h4>
<p class="flush_left"><a id="pg_121"/><em>Mojama</em> continues to be the best-known tuna <em>salazón</em>, especially outside Spain. Eaten thinly sliced in the same way as cured ham, it has a dedicated following among chefs and customers. In Spain it is most popular with roasted almonds or fresh tomatoes but it is occasionally dressed with rosemary and pairs extremely well with eggs. A slice of <em>mojama</em> with a fried quail’s egg is an excellent tapa.</p>
<p class="indented">The warm, dry, coastal breezes of the Cádiz coastline make it the perfect place to dry-cure the fish to preserve it for eating throughout the year. The most sought-after <em>mojama</em> is made with bluefin tuna; however, due to the scarcity and protection of the species, most is now made with yellowfin caught in tropical seas, frozen then and there and brought into harbour for curing. Even the elite and most established local buyers will only manage to produce a tiny amount of <em>mojama</em> made with bluefin tuna caught in the traditional <em>almadraba</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#p204a">here</a>), which will be sold to their most discerning of customers, to whom price is no object.</p>
<p class="indented">Successful <em>mojama</em> requires cuts of tuna that have a lower fat content, so it is made from the four loins known as <em>descargamentos</em> or <em>descargados. Descargamentos,</em> the highest grade, are closer to the spine and are of a slightly superior quality for curing and drying.</p>
<p class="indented">The pieces are washed, then stacked and pressed in sea salt for 24 hours, washed again, dried briefly and, finally, hung up in special rooms to air dry naturally and slowly for anything from 15 to 25 weeks, depending on the particular piece of fish. As the fish loses moisture it firms up and shrinks and develops its characteristic deep red-amber colour and intense flavour.</p>
<div class="diamond-image"><a id="pg_122"/><img alt="image" class="width50" src="../images/pg122.jpg"/></div>
<p class="square-subhead">‘a vital and much cherished ingredient’</p>
<p class="flush_left">In the UK we have something of an obsession with these little fish, yet oddly we frequently use substandard ones – the kind of crusty powdery brown specimens that turn up on cheap pizzas, or the flabby white <em>boquerones</em> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#rec41">here</a>) that can be overpowered by a sharp vinegar marinade.</p>
<p class="indented">In Spain, however, anchovies are a vital and much cherished ingredient, used in many, many ways, but often simply combined with the likes of olives, tomatoes and sweet peppers and piled on to <em>pan con tomate</em> (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_72">here</a>) or added to salads.</p>
<p class="indented">A forage fish related to the herring, the European anchovy (<em>Engraulis encrasicolus</em>) is found not only around the coasts of Spain, but also of Portugal, Morocco and the Mediterranean, and is a diﬀerent species to the one you might come across from Latin America, which, although it can look bigger and more impressive, often has yellowy flesh that is hard and chewy, with little flavour of fish.</p>
<p class="indented">It is the Cantabrian anchovy, caught in the Atlantic ocean along the whole of the Cantabrian and Basque coastlines, that is the king of them all. One of the world’s great foods, this is a fish to convert the most serial anchovy-sceptic into a believer in one mouthful. The very best fish are fat and fleshy, with an aroma of the sea and a taste that is intense, rounded and meaty, with a real savoury nuttiness. Even when cured, such anchovies should taste more of fish than of salt, and still be tender in texture.</p>
<p class="indented">I still remember my own moment of discovery back in 1991 when my colleague of the time, Emma Ranson, first brought me some Cantabrian anchovies cured by the Ortiz family, whose tinned fish are famous in the region. I realised I had no idea how they should taste, having only really eaten anchovies that ranged from mediocre to quite horrid – but the moment I tried them a new chapter opened up for me that would involve multiple visits to the north coast of Spain to learn how anchovies were treated in order to be so valued.</p>
<p class="indented">It is the temperature of the Bay of Biscay, locally known as <em>el Mar Cantábrico</em> (the Cantabrian Sea), combined with the salinity of the plankton-rich waters, that contributes markedly to the quality of the fish.</p>
<p class="indented">The anchovies make their annual journey from the bay all the way to northern Europe during the winter, swimming in deep waters where the colder temperatures help their fat to develop and protect them. Then, as the weather warms up in spring, the plump shoals swim south on the return journey along the French coast back to the bay. Here the turbulent waters with a temperature of 14–18°C are full of algal blooms, which are a great food for the fish, and the <a id="pg_124"/>underwater shelf edges provide a protected area for spawning.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_123"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg123.jpg"/></div>
<p class="indented">The best fish tend to be caught in April (traditionally with circular surface nets) and their flesh is smooth, thick and firm-textured, almost like a tender meat.</p>
<p class="indented">When the fishermen land their catch, some anchovies will go fresh to fishmongers and restaurateurs, typically to be boned, split, butterflied-out, coated in flour and fried like sardines – delicious – but in general they are cured.</p>
<p class="indented">As with so many species of fish, however, stocks of Cantabrian anchovies are running desperately low, thanks to years of over-fishing (with some fleets fishing all year round) combined with a reduction in fishing grounds, the use of pelagic nets (towed behind big freezer-trawlers) and environmental factors such as changes in temperature, wind and the salinity of the sea. All of this has affected the anchovies’ food supply and their spawning grounds. In 1965, 80,000 tonnes of anchovies were fished in the Cantabrian Sea, but between 2002 and 2004 the average annual catch had fallen to only 10,000 tonnes. To try to get things back on track after this dramatic fall, the fishery was closed for five years. Since it re-opened in 2010, although quotas have virtually doubled each year, the permitted season for fishing is short, just from April to June.</p>
<p class="indented">The scarcity of Cantabrian anchovies has meant that, for a few years now, even those anchovy specialists most respected for the integrity and the quality of their produce have sometimes had to look beyond Cantabrian waters for their anchovies. The closest to the Cantabrian fish is the Mediterranean anchovy, and when it is fished in cooler areas and transported quickly to the salting houses, the difference in quality may not be that great. However, the temperature of the Mediterranean varies considerably, and if the fish come from warmer waters, possibly even other countries, where they live in different environments, they may not develop their size, flavour and texture in the same way.</p>
<p class="indented">People often think that anchovies packed in salt or oil have been through different processes. In fact, they both start off in the same way, whole (though with heads and guts removed) in salt. The difference is that only the biggest and best fish are destined to remain in salt, since only these can stand up to a long salting and pressing. Those fish that are of average size are given an initial salting and pressing in large barrels, then they will be taken out, cleaned, filleted and canned in oil. A small quantity of smaller fish might be lightly salted, then smoked; or marinated in oil and vinegar – in which case they are known as <em>boquerones</em>.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Anchovies in salt</h4>
<p class="flush_left">The biggest, fattest anchovies are salted and pressed in the large <em>salazón</em> (salting) tins in which they will be sold – a technique that was started along the Cantabrian coastline in the 1880s by the Sicilian community that had settled there. The fish are arranged in their tins in layers of either ten or fourteen – the fewer per layer the better – in a criss-cross pattern, with each layer of fish separated by a layer of rock salt. A plastic neck disc goes over the top and the tins are placed in rows underneath huge weights which gradually press down on to the discs as the fish exude water and volume.</p>
<p class="indented">On average the anchovies will lose half their weight as they are pressed and aged in this way over 6–8 months, until the discs become almost level with the tops of each tin. At this point the discs are removed and the tins are sealed and labelled according to the number of fish they contain (the fewer the better, as this indicates the biggest, fattest anchovies).</p>
<p class="indented">These are the anchovies that are sought after by chefs, because when you fillet them not only are they sumptuous looking and tasting, but they have a lovely pinky colour which is lost when the fillets are kept under oil. The late Rose Gray of the River Café used to love the biggest of our Ortiz anchovies, which she and her chefs would just clean, fillet and drape over a salad. I will never <a id="pg_125"/>forget the mutual appreciation on the day I took Javier Ortiz to the restaurant to meet her, which culminated in her insisting that he carve his signature with a knife into one of the huge, iconic, bright, slightly retro-looking Ortiz anchovy tins. I know people who love these so much they have clocks and all kinds of artefacts made from them, and I have some big lids at home that have been machine-edged so that they are no longer sharp, which I sometimes use as platters for serving seafood starters and tapas.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec39">Anchoas de l’escala</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">L’Escala anchovies from Catalunya</p>
<p class="flush_left">The Catalans are famous for the anchovies (<em>anxoves</em> in Catalan) from L’Escala near Girona, where the preserving process has remained virtually unchanged since the days of the Greeks and Romans. You can still see the remains of an ancient salting factory a few kilometres from L’Escala in Empúries, where the fish were prepared, left in salting tanks and then packed into <em>amphorae</em> (jars).</p>
<p class="indented">Fished from the Mediterranean, L’Escala anchovies are smaller and rounder than their Atlantic counterparts, and have a lower fat content. After a lighter pressing, they are typically sold whole, in salt, in jars – though there is beginning to be some diversification into fillets under oil. Typically they are served in a salad with Little Gem lettuce, or piled on to toasted tomato bread (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_72">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">The catch is smaller than in other fisheries, and while the fish are cured for 2–6 months, depending on the season (higher summer temperatures can speed up the process), they are pressed more gently than their Cantabrian counterparts and so are juicier and plumper-textured; more like fresh or smoked fish and less salty in taste. They are similar to the famous French style of anchovy fished and cured in the village of Collioures near Perpignan – the ones that you find on a traditional <em>pissaladi</em>è<em>re</em>.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">How to choose anchovies</h4>
<p class="flush_left">If you are looking for Cantabrian anchovies, unfortunately labels don’t always tell you everything you want to know. Even the best canners often take the attitude that their customers will trust them to choose the very best anchovies they can find, even if this means sometimes buying from outside the local waters, and you have little choice but to go along with this, as the provenance of the fish will not necessarily be obvious from the tins. Labels on preserved fish, unlike those on fresh fish, don’t need to declare its origin, so while the production or packing site might be in Cantabria, the anchovies may have come from somewhere else.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">To counteract this uncertainty, some smaller Basque producers are now banding together to label their tins <em>Conserveros Artesanos de la Costa Vasca</em>, which is a new guarantee (that also applies to tuna) certifying that the origins of the fish are on the Costa Vasca, the stretch of Basque coastline around the Bay of Biscay, and that the fish is caught and processed in season. All fishermen, boats and processors are registered and audited twice a year to guarantee traceability of origin and quality, and to keep out fraudsters. For small companies, choosing to impose these standards might be tough, but it can also allow them to stand out from the bigger concerns.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">I am always asked which are best, whole anchovies in salt, or fillets in oil. Well, ultimately, you can’t beat a long, fat anchovy that has stayed in its salty sea environment right up to the moment that you fillet it. The advantage of buying whole fish kept under salt is that these will be the biggest and most sturdy of the catch, whose scales and density of flesh can stand up to the salting and tight pressing so they remain rich and meaty, with a surprising ability to retain the aroma of the sea. The very best will always be those preserved in the largest tins, usually of 5 or 10kg, but whereas in Spain specialist market stalls and fish counters will dispense anchovies <a id="pg_126"/>from these tins, as we do at Brindisa, in the UK it isn’t always easy to find delicatessens willing to do this, and so the biggest tins tend to be bought only by chefs. Currently, the smallest tin of salted anchovies you can buy is around 850g – so you still either need lots of anchovy-eating friends or, once the tin is opened, you can transfer any fish you don’t need to a bowl, cover them with wet salt and keep them in the fridge for up to a week.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">The good news, though, is that more and more producers are looking at different ways of packaging whole salted anchovies that should make it easier to buy whole, big fish in smaller quantities. Already at Brindisa we are occasionally able to receive small batches of vacuum-packed sleeves containing around four or five anchovies in rock salt brine.</p>
<h4 class="c_head" id="p126b">To prepare whole anchovies in salt for eating</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Wash off the exterior salt, then, starting at the tail end, split the fish in two by running your fingernail along the backbone, which can then be pulled away from whichever fillet it clings to. The flesh will be pinky-brown and there will be a deep red line where you have pulled away the spine. The finest fish, caught at the right time in the best environment, will have compact flesh and an aroma and flavour that are a delicate balance of fish, salt and sea.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">You can rub off the scales, if you prefer, then dress the fillets simply with olive oil and eat them alone, or on a slice of <em>pan con tomate</em> (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_72">here</a>), add them to a salad, or use them in whatever recipe you have chosen.</p>
<h4 class="c_head" id="pg126a">How to choose anchovy fillets in oil</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Because they are more convenient I always have tins of good anchovies in oil at home – which have the added advantage that you don’t have to fillet them. Do go for the best and biggest grade you can afford, though. Big is always beautiful where anchovies are concerned, and as with anchovies under salt, the bigger the tin, the bigger the fish. Or again, buy them loose, if possible.</p>
<p class="method">Anchovies in oil look more brown than pink in colour and ironically can be a little saltier than the ones that stay packed whole in salt. This is because they will always be relatively smaller fish, so they will absorb more salt when they are in the barrels for their initial curing.</p>
<p class="method">All anchovies stored in oil are hand-filleted, but the better canners will do this using a knife, rather than scissors, removing all the tiny bones inside, so the fillets should have a tidy shape, well-trimmed, with no ‘hairy’ edges of fine bones.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">If a fillet conserved in oil has yellow tones or streaks on the flesh, this shows the fat content has oxidised and turned rancid during what might have been an ineffective pressing process, i.e. not heavy and long enough to expel all the fat from the fish and give the best flavour. White tones in the fillet are also not a good sign, as they show that the anchovy has suffered from exposure to heat at some point in the pressing or canning process. And dark markings show that the fillets haven’t been handled carefully enough to avoid bruising.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">The best producers often prefer to pack premium fillets carefully in jars of oil rather than tins, so that customers can recognise the quality – since most defects can be seen. Just be careful not to break the fillets when you remove them.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">Choose fillets in olive oil rather than vegetable oil, which can taint the fish. Some canners suggest that they are adding value by using extra virgin olive oil, but my view is that you don’t want a stunning oil, especially if it is strongly flavoured and deeply coloured, as it will detract from the taste and appearance of the fish, which shouldn’t need any disguise.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">People assume that, just like baked beans, you can keep tins or jars of anchovies in your cupboard <a id="pg_127"/>and they won’t change, and in UK supermarkets they will be stacked on the shelves at ambient temperature, but over time the anchovies will alter and become stronger-tasting. In Spain all good retailers will keep their tins of anchovies chilled in the fridge, as we do at Brindisa.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec40">Anchoas ahumadas</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Smoked anchovies</p>
<p class="flush_left">One of the alternative techniques of conservation is smoking. The anchovies are salted briefly first – just enough to draw out some of the water in the fish – but not pressed. Then they are cleaned and smoked over wood before being filleted and packed in oil. Their flavour is less salty but fishy and rounded, the smoky flavour is gentle, and because they have not been pressed the fillets stay plump and juicy, so the experience is more like eating a fresh fish.</p>
<p class="indented">We buy ours from the Nardín family in the Basque country, who pioneered the art of smoking with beech, a typical Basque wood that is also used for the light smoking of the famous Idiazábal cheese.</p>
<p class="indented">Smoked anchovies pair well with beetroot in salads, or red peppers on toast, and are quite a favourite with chefs. Heston Blumenthal has used them with beef, or with roast marrowbone, parsley and pickled vegetables on toast.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec41">Boquerones</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Marinated anchovies</p>
<p class="flush_left">The other very popular method of conserving is to fillet the anchovies, clean them with water and then steep them in a mild vinegar marinade which ‘pickles’ them.</p>
<p class="indented">The flesh is naturally bleached white by the vinegar, so <em>boquerones</em> are often known as white anchovies. They are very versatile and have a wide appeal because they are not at all salty, and when they are done well, with good fish and a gentle marinade, they can be a real treat: mild and fresh-tasting with a unique aroma, perfect as a tapa on their own, in salads or combined with cured anchovy fillets on toast (see <em>matrimonio</em>, <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_131">here</a>). However, the downside can be that once in the marinade it is harder to detect the quality of the fish. Also, the vinegar used can sometimes be overpoweringly harsh.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">How to choose <strong><em>boquerones</em></strong></h4>
<p class="flush_left"><em>Boquerones</em> tend to be sold by the weight or in plastic trays, and tasting for the strength of the vinegar is rarely an option before buying, so it is best to find a shop that sells them to your taste, and stick with it. Rarely are <em>boquerones</em> sold in tins, except for the perfect ones labelled <em>anchoa a la vinagreta</em>, made by Conservas Nardín.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">When buying <em>boquerones</em>, look for silky-textured, slender white fillets with tones of grey. They shouldn’t be big and fat, as in Spain large anchovies usually go for salting, so if they are very big, this is a clue that the fish are a different variety of anchovy from South America, which will not have the same flavour and delicate texture. Colour-wise, a more yellow anchovy may again signify a variety that is not Spanish.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">Despite being stored in vinegar, <em>boquerones</em> do not last as long as salted ones, so it is best to buy them early in their date ‘window’ or they can lose texture and become pasty.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">If you find the taste of the vinegar too strong, you can usually rescue this by adding your own dressing. Drain the anchovies of their vinegar, then replace this with a combination of olive oil and a gentle, sweeter vinegar such as Moscatel or Chardonnay, some chopped parsley and garlic. Add a few Manzanilla olives if you like.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">Like all anchovies, whether tinned, jarred, under salt or smoked, <em>boquerones</em> should always be stored in the fridge.</p>

<p class="square-subhead">‘a tin of good sardines is a great lunch or supper’</p>
<p class="flush_left">I think there is almost no wrong way to eat sardines: they are so good, whether fresh, conserved, big or small. A tin of good sardines with some sliced tomato and chopped parsley inside slices of fresh bread, accompanied by a bottle of beer, is a great lunch or supper.</p>
<p class="indented">The very best are caught in colder waters off the Galician coast (where they are known as <em>xoubas</em>), as they swim from Asturias towards Porto in Portugal, and where there are strict regulations and quotas to protect stocks. The sardines are netted after spawning and in this stage of their life-cycle they are carrying maximum levels of fat, which gives the flesh great flavour. This is thanks to the abundance and rich variety of plankton in these areas, which allows the sardines to feed well and grow fat and strong to withstand the cold waters and turbulent currents. The sardines are fished close to the coast rather than in the open sea, using nets that allow some fish to escape, so they don’t get too crowded and crushed, and by-catch such as dolphins is avoided.</p>
<p class="indented">La Noche de San Juan, the night of St John, on 23 June, signals the start of the sardine harvest, which will run until September. At midnight fires are lit and families grill the first of the season’s fish. The best producers of canned sardines, however, will be waiting to purchase their fish at just the right moment when the quality is exactly what they are looking for. Often this is in a very small window, maybe only 2–3 weeks; sometimes only one week. Producers will often attend the auctions of the landed fish themselves, or they will have their own paid watchman on the floor of the <em>lonxa</em> (fish market), selecting the best batches only from fishermen they trust, who readily show their records of each journey and the time spent at sea, which has an impact on the quality of the catch. Once bought, the fish, if it is to be conserved, needs to go for processing immediately, to retain its best characteristics.</p>
<p class="indented">By law sardines must be a maximum of 25cm, and smaller fish between 10cm and 16cm must be called <em>sardinillas.</em> On average these are around 11cm and can be exceptional, especially during the window when the real cream of the catch is coming through.</p>
<p class="indented">Both sardines and <em>sardinillas</em> are gutted and their tails removed by hand in one swift movement (the verb for this is <em>esmojar</em>), then they are processed by steaming at a high temperature, so that the fat is retained within the fish, and, finally, they are packed, either in olive oil or a variety of preparations, from plain brine to tomato sauce (<em>a la Americana</em>), <em>escabeche</em> (with vinegar and/or <em>pimentón</em>), or black ink. If you buy <em>xoubas picantes</em> there will be red chilli and a slice of carrot and cornichon beneath the fish.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_129"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg129.jpg"/></div>
<p class="indented"><a id="pg_130"/>Both sardines and <em>sardinillas</em> improve their flavour in the tin, so the longer you keep them – up to three years – the better they will taste once opened.</p>

<p class="flush_left">Some fish in the sardine family – we know them as pilchards – are sold ‘anchovified’, i.e. they look very similar to large anchovy fillets.</p>
<p class="indented">The conservation process is different, however, as the fresh fish are cured in brine and turned daily over a period of 5 days, then they are filleted, scaled, washed and air-dried in a room with high humidity for 7–12 hours, before being seasoned and packed in sunflower oil.</p>
<p class="indented">They have a wonderfully intense flavour of the sea and a very meaty texture, perfect in a salad of peppery leaves such as watercress, with a squeeze of lemon and olive oil. They are also good served on toast as a <em>montadito</em> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_131">here</a>) with <em>piquillo</em> peppers or fresh cheese.</p>

<p class="flush_left1">One day when I was working on this book, a photo pinged on to my mobile phone from chef Barny Haughton, a dear friend known affectionately as the godfather of Bristol chefs. After many acclaimed years at Bordeaux Quay in the city, he now runs the Square Food Foundation there, with its cooking school and café, and is an ambassador for Slow Food. The picture was of a shallow pan, filled with golden, pink, green, yellow and purple stalks. The chard season had arrived and Barny was braising the juicy stems ready to pile on toast and sprinkle with shavings of young Manchego cheese. This is his recipe, which is really tasty – though sadly the chard stalks don’t look quite as brightly coloured at the end of cooking.</p>
<p class="indented">The juices from the chard soak into the toasted bread, so you need at least a serviette and maybe even a knife and fork to eat the <em>llesques</em> easily.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 small red onion, finely sliced</p>
<p class="ingredients">a few dried chilli flakes</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 clove of garlic, finely sliced</p>
<p class="ingredients">400g rainbow chard stalks, cut into 3cm lengths</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">juice of ½ a lemon</p>

<p class="method">Heat a little olive oil in a large frying pan, add the onion and chilli flakes and cook gently until the onion is soft but not coloured. Turn the heat up, add the garlic and fry a little bit more, but take care not to burn it, or it will turn bitter. Add the chard stalks. Once they have started to sizzle, add the smallest amount of water – just enough to stop the chard stalks frying – and a generous pinch of salt. You may need to add a little more water as the stalks cook.</p>

<p class="square-subhead">'garlic and oil'</p>
<p class="method">The original <em>alioli</em> is made without eggs – the Catalan <em>all i oli</em> means <em>garlic and oil</em> – and purists will always make it this way. However, it requires a lot of work and immense patience and skill, because you can overdo the blending and the sauce will split in a fraction of a second. Even when you make it with eggs, just like making any mayonnaise, it needs to be done carefully to avoid splitting. So if I am making the quantity here I admit I use a food processor (it needs to be one where the blades reach right to the edge of the bowl so that it pulls in the oil better), or you can use a blender – in which case you can just chop the garlic and let the machine do the rest.</p>
<p class="indented">If you want to make a half quantity, using 200ml of olive oil, 1 clove of garlic, just 1 small egg (no added yolk) and ½ teaspoon of salt, the safest way to make sure the emulsion works is to crush the garlic to a pulp in a pestle and mortar first, then whisk in the egg and salt, before slowly adding the oil.</p>
<p class="indented">Depending on what you are serving <em>alioli</em> with, you might like to make it stronger or lighter in flavour. We prefer stronger oils for meat dishes and lighter ones (plus a dash of lemon juice) for fish or vegetable dishes.</p>
<p class="indented">It is surprising how many variations on the classic recipe you come across; for example, some people add honey, dark chocolate, or even squid ink. Perhaps more unusually I have come across quince as an addition, for which I have given two recipes following this one.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes around 400ml</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 cloves of garlic</p>

<p class="ingredients">400ml extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="method">Halve the garlic cloves, remove the centre germ if it is large and green (this removes any bitterness), then chop the cloves.</p>
<p class="method">Put the garlic into a food processor or blender with the lemon juice, if using, and blend, add the eggs and the salt and blend again, then slowly start adding the olive oil. Stop as soon as all the ingredients have emulsified and the <em>alioli</em> is thick and yellow. Taste and add more lemon juice if necessary.</p>

<p class="flush_left">Joan Puigcercós is a fiery, eloquent, tall, dark and imposing ex-politician who is a neighbour and friend of my brother in the village of Santa Maria d’Oló in Catalunya. A man with a deep love of his surrounding countryside and the Ripollés mountains where he grew up, he supports the independence of Catalunya, and represented the ERC (Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya) at the Spanish parliament. Whenever I meet him, however, we always talk about food, as he is also an outstanding cook, with a library of cookery books at his weekday base in Barcelona and his home in Santa Maria, where at weekends he takes over the cooking from his wife, Núria.</p>
<p class="indented">Joan aims for an <em>alioli</em> with a jelly-like texture, which can actually be sliced rather than spread, but since that is quite challenging to achieve, we came up with a variation which is much easier and is more of a fruit purée than an emulsion. It is surprisingly tasty and, because of its resemblance to apple sauce, goes well with tapas of grilled <em>botifarras</em> or <em>pintxos</em>, as well as roast pork and game dishes.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec48">Alioli de Nadal</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Christmas <em>alioli</em></p>
<p class="flush_left">This is a more elaborate quince <em>alioli</em>, bulked out with walnuts, again from Joan Puigcercós, who explained to me that it was once an essential part of the <em>Noche Buena,</em> the Christmas Eve vigil that used to be celebrated in his mountain village (<em>Nadal</em> is Catalan for Christmas). All the villagers would gather at midnight in the eleventh-century stone church and keep watch until 6 a.m., not an easy thing to do on a bitterly cold night in the days before central heating. To keep everyone going the people would take with them big <em>panes de coca –</em> traditional Catalan flatbreads (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_70">here</a>) – baked in the communal village oven, which would be anointed with this <em>alioli de Nadal</em> to help bulk it out, and they would drink glasses of strong red wine or Moscatel.</p>
<p class="indented">Even though the vigil is no longer practised, Joan still makes this alioli every Christmas. We like it as a dip for crudités or with roasted vegetables as well as an accompaniment to darker meats such as beef or game, lamb chops or sausages.</p>
<p class="indented">Because of the addition of bread, quince and walnuts this is easier to make using a pestle and mortar than the classic <em>alioli</em>, but you do need a big mortar, and it works equally well done in a food processor. If you prefer a more textured <em>alioli,</em> however, chop the walnuts, rather than blend them, and mix them in at the end.</p>
<p class="indented">Joan also likes to add a sweet potato, but this is optional. If you want to try this, roast the sweet potato in the oven and then add as much as you like, to taste, pounding or pulsing it along with the other ingredients.</p>
<p class="indented">You can use quince paste rather than freshly poached quince: if you do this you will need 50g. In order to really bring out the quince and walnut flavours it is important to use a mild olive oil, as a strong extra virgin one will be too overpowering.</p>
<p class="makes"><a id="pg_139"/>Serves 8 as a dip or accompaniment</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 quince</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 peppercorns</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon sugar</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a cinnamon stick</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g walnuts</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 cloves of garlic, peeled</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 slice of bread (about 50g) with the crust taken off, torn into pieces</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon Moscatel or PX sherry</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 egg yolks</p>
<p class="ingredients">350ml mild olive oil</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas 4.</p>
<p class="method">Put the whole quince into a pan with the peppercorns, sugar and cinnamon and enough water to cover. Bring to the boil, then turn down the heat and simmer for about 25 minutes. Check that the quince is cooked through by piercing it with a skewer: there should be no sense of woody resistance as it passes through the fruit. Drain (discarding the peppercorns and cinnamon) and allow to cool.</p>
<p class="method">Lay the walnuts on a tray and roast them in the preheated oven for about 7 minutes, until browned. Remove and leave to cool.</p>
<p class="method">Peel and de-seed the quince, discarding any tough fibrous lumps of uncooked fruit.</p>
<p class="method">Remove any green shoots from the garlic to prevent a bitter aftertaste in the <em>alioli</em> and then either pound the cloves with the walnuts to a rough paste using a pestle and mortar, or pulse briefly in a blender. Add the quince flesh and pound/pulse until smooth. Next, add the bread and pound/pulse again, then pour in the Moscatel, or sherry, and the egg yolks and continue to pulse/pound until smooth again.</p>
<p class="method">Finally, pour in the olive oil, slowly and a little at a time, pounding or pulsing until you have a firm and smooth mixture that resembles hummus.</p>

<p class="square-subhead">‘the key to some of Spain’s most iconic and ancient preparations’</p>
<p class="flush_left">The earliest garlic harvest in all of Europe begins in Andalucía in May, while June and July are the harvest months for the growers of Castilla y León, who celebrate with a festival in the city of Zamora on 28 June, St Peter’s Day. The streets are lined with pyramids of garlic strings, stacked on pallets and way taller than their vendors, their aroma hanging assertively in the air.</p>
<p class="indented">Although originally from Central Asia, garlic has been cultivated around Spain for over 2,000 years and the country is now Europe’s leading producer. The most famous variety is the purple <em>ajo morado</em> from Las Pedroñeras in the province of Cuenca in La Mancha, which has fragile white outer layers with tight purple-wrapped cloves inside, and a sweet flavour with a strong punch.</p>
<p class="indented">Garlic is the key to some of Spain’s most iconic and ancient preparations, such as <em>alioli</em> (and all its variations with saffron, quince or walnuts); <em>gazpacho</em> – which existed as a garlic, water and bread soup before the arrival of the tomato in Spain – and <em>picada</em>, the crushed paste made with garlic, herbs and nuts, etc. (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_320">here</a>). Beyond this, its use varies from region to region.</p>
<p class="indented">In Catalunya and the Levante, sometimes before being added to a sauce or <em>picada</em>, a whole head of garlic or individual cloves (still in their skins) will be lightly roasted first, either in the oven or over a flame, which gives a smoky aroma and soft creamy flesh.</p>
<p class="indented">Francisco Juan Martínez Lledo, one of the chefs from Alicante at our restaurant in Shoreditch, introduced me to a method that he particularly likes to use. He crushes the garlic cloves still in their skins and fries them gently in hot olive oil in the corner of a pan that he has tilted slightly to provide a deeper well of oil. The skins shrivel and he discards these, but the little crushed pieces of garlic flesh in irregular shapes and sizes cook slightly differently, so some are toastier, some fresher. Thin, straggly strips will begin to caramelise, while larger chunks will remain almost raw in the middle and these can be crushed with the back of a spoon. When he scoops the pieces out and adds them to his <em>picadas</em> they give more complex layers of flavour.</p>
<p class="indented">In the UK, the green garlic shoots (actually flowering spikes) that sprout from hardneck varieties of garlic in March and April tend to be pulled off and thrown away to encourage the growth of the bulb, but in Spain these <em>ajetes</em> (or scapes as we call them) are a very short seasonal treat, pounced on in a similar way to wild garlic from the British woodland (though this is a different family). If there is a surplus the scapes will be frozen, as they are excellent in scrambled eggs, sautéd and scattered over green vegetables, chopped into salads or pounded into <em>picadas</em> or pestos. In the UK, you can sometimes buy them from garlic farms in the summer.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec49"><a id="pg_142"/>Coca de recapte</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Catalan flatbread</p>
<p class="flush_left">Of all the many recipes for <em>coques</em> – flatbreads, which can be sweet or savoury (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_70">here</a>), the pizza-like ones are perfect for slicing and serving with other small plates. Sometimes I feel as if these <em>coques</em> are a forgotten piece in the jigsaw of Spanish food, since the Italian versions have taken over the world.</p>
<p class="indented">The name <em>recapte</em> really means ‘made with things in the house’, in other words the base is topped with whatever you have to hand, but most usually this would be <em>escalivada</em> (roasted vegetables). In villages where few people had ovens, the local baker would go around the houses collecting whatever ingredients each family was able to contribute, then make a selection of <em>coques</em> to be shared out among the whole community.</p>
<p class="indented">Toni Chueca of La Bauma dairy in Catalunya, who gave me this recipe, remembers that in the time of his grandparents this <em>coca</em> was made to welcome the ‘sunshine season’, when juicy onions, peppers, aubergines and tomatoes would be in abundance in the vegetable plot. Olive oil would be poured over the stretched dough, then the vegetables arranged in strips. On to this base you could add anything else you had, such as chard, sardines, anchovies, tuna, or slices of sausage. Once in the oven the base puffs up like a pillow, and is firm around the edge and light, soft and juicy in the centre beneath the vegetables and other ingredients.</p>
<p class="indented">Unlike the typical Italian pizza, a <em>coca</em> typically doesn’t involve cheese. That said, Toni likes to break with tradition by shaving a little of his semi-hard Garrotxa over the top – and I have to say it is really very good!</p>
<p class="indented"><em>Coca</em> is delicious just warm after baking, but the old-fashioned way is to eat it cold the next day – it is up to you.</p>
<p class="indented">As it is easier to make the dough in relatively large quantities, this recipe will make two <em>coques</em>, each big enough to serve four people, but if you don’t want to make them both immediately, you can freeze half the dough for another time.</p>
<p class="makes">Makes 2 <strong><em>coques</em></strong>, each big enough to serve 4 for tapas</p>
<p class="ingredients">15g fresh yeast</p>
<p class="ingredients">500g plain flour, plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">100ml olive oil</p>
<p class="forhead">For the topping</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 red peppers</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 aubergines</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 large sweet onions</p>
<p class="ingredients">6 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">12 fresh sardines, filleted and each fillet cut in half lengthways</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 teaspoons chopped parsley</p>
<p class="method">For the base, dissolve the yeast in 2 tablespoons of warm water. Put the flour into a bowl, make a well in the centre, and pour in the yeast and warm water. Sprinkle the salt around the edges of the flour and pour in 100ml of water. With your hands, begin to mix the ingredients into a dough, adding another 100ml of water when it starts to come together, then turn out on to a lightly floured work surface and continue to knead until the dough has a uniform, smooth, elastic consistency (you may need to add a little more water or flour).</p>
<p class="method">Dust a clean bowl with flour, put in the dough, sprinkle the surface with a little more flour, then cover with clingfilm to prevent any draughts forming a crust. Leave somewhere warm for 30 minutes, then allow the dough to rest for a further hour or two at room temperature until it doubles in size.</p>
<p class="method">Towards the end of the resting time, make the topping. Preheat the oven to 200°C/gas 6.</p>
<p class="method">Rub the peppers, aubergines and unpeeled onions with the olive oil, making sure they are well covered. Put into an ovenproof dish, cover with foil, then put into the preheated oven for <a id="pg_143"/>40 minutes, removing the foil halfway through and turning the vegetables, so they brown equally on both sides. Remove them when they are tender (the onions may need a bit longer – possibly another 20 minutes).</p>
<p class="method">Turn down the oven to 180°C/gas 4.</p>
<p class="method">While still warm, peel the skin from the peppers and cut them into thin strips. Peel the aubergines and de-seed if necessary. Slice the flesh into thin strips, and then into small dice. Peel and finely slice the onions.</p>
<p class="method">Remove the clingfilm from the bowl of dough and add the olive oil slowly, a little at a time, squeezing the dough initially to help the oil blend in, and then kneading vigorously until it is completely absorbed. Cover again with clingfilm and leave to rest at room temperature for another 30 minutes. The dough will rise some more, though not as much this time.</p>
<p class="method">Line two 40cm x 25cm oven trays with baking paper.</p>
<p class="method">Generously flour your work surface – you may need flour on your hands as well as your rolling pin, as the dough will be very sticky. Roll out the dough into two rectangles of around 40cm x 25cm, and 5mm thick. Roll each around your rolling pin and then unroll on to the trays.</p>
<p class="method">To each, add a layer of sliced onion, leaving a 2cm rim around the edge of the dough. Next, add the aubergine and sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Finally, alternate the sardine and pepper strips diagonally on top – lay the sardines skin side up, so that this will turn crispy – and put into the top of the oven for 25–30 minutes until the dough is firm and golden brown.</p>
<p class="method">Remove from the oven, sprinkle with parsley and serve warm.</p>
<p class="recipe-head2" id="reca4"><a id="pg_144"/>SOPAS FRíAS</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead1">Cold soups</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Gazpacho</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Although these days <em>gazpacho</em> seems to be universally understood as a cold soup made with tomato, it existed long before the tomato arrived in Spain, and the name really refers to an idea rather than a specific recipe. Originally it was devised as a way of using up old bread by combining it with the kind of rustic essentials that most people would have at home: garlic, olive oil, vinegar and salt. If there were nuts to be had these would be ground and added, sometimes with onion and any other available vegetables. When the tomato and the pepper began to appear in the sixteenth century these made perfect additions – but not all <em>gazpachos</em> contain either.</p>
<p class="indented">In Spain it has become the fashion for chefs to rediscover and rework old recipes for <em>gazpacho</em> and also to invent new ones. Often these, especially ones made with fruits (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_148">here</a>), are made without bread. You only have to browse through chef Alberto Herráiz’s beautiful book, <em>Gazpacho</em>, to get the picture. Originally from Cuenca in Castile-La Mancha, Herráiz set up his restaurant Fogón Saint Julien in Paris, re-interpreting not only <em>gazpacho</em>, but tapas and other Spanish dishes. He adds all sorts of ingredients to his <em>gazpachos</em>, from strawberries to beetroot, even anchovies, and Rupert and I have enjoyed working our way through his recipes at home.</p>
<h4 class="c_head"><a id="pg_145"/>Some <strong><em>gazpacho</em> notes</strong></h4>
<p class="flush_left">If you are using bread it should be 1–2 days old, so that it absorbs all the flavours. You need a dense loaf that won’t turn to mush.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">As a rule, most tomato-based <em>gazpachos</em> benefit from being allowed to infuse for a few hours before blending. We put all the ingredients together in a plastic food container in the fridge.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">If using a liquidiser, choose a slow speed to preserve all the nutrients and the bright colour.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">Where water is added, Spanish chefs will often use spring water for its purity. As far as tap water goes, hard water without calcium gives the best results.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">Add the olive oil slowly so that it properly emulsifies. <em>Gazpachos</em> offer a good opportunity to experiment with different oils, which can subtly affect the flavour.</p>
<p class="flush_left1">If you are not using the <em>gazpacho</em> straight away, keep it chilled in the fridge and use within 3 days.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec50">Gazpacho andaluz</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Chilled tomato soup from Andalucía</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is the summer classic in our tapas kitchens. You need ripe tomatoes, which will give the aroma and colour that a good <em>gazpacho</em> needs.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 8–10</p>
<p class="ingredients">1kg ripe tomatoes, cut into large chunks</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g cucumber (about ⅓ of a cucumber), peeled and cut into large chunks</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 medium onion, cut into large chunks</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 cloves of garlic, cut in half</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 <strong><em>piquillo</em></strong> peppers (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g bread, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons sherry vinegar</p>
<p class="ingredients">200ml extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">a pinch of ground cumin (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt, to taste</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g ice cubes</p>
<p class="forhead">To serve</p>
<p class="ingredients">pieces of bread, fried in olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">finely chopped cucumber (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredients">finely chopped red pepper (optional)</p>
<p class="method">Put the tomatoes, cucumber, onion, garlic and peppers, if using, into a bowl or plastic food container, add the chopped bread, vinegar and half the extra virgin olive oil and put into the fridge to infuse for 2 hours.</p>
<p class="method">Add all the rest of the ingredients apart from the remaining extra virgin olive oil, and begin to blend with a hand blender, adding the rest of the oil a little at a time until you have a creamy, soup consistency, then pass through a fine sieve.</p>
<p class="method">Serve with the fried bread scattered over, and, if you like, some finely chopped cucumber and red pepper.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec51"><a id="pg_146"/>Gazpacho de tomate y pimiento choricero</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Tomato and dried red pepper <em>gazpacho</em></p>
<p class="flush_left">This is our executive chef Josep’s variation on an idea in Alberto Herráiz’s book <em>Gazpacho,</em> and one that we particularly like to make at home, where we are always looking for ideas for the dried peppers which we have in abundance, particularly the <em>choricero</em>. One of our favourite peppers, it is used particularly by the Basques in their thick pepper sauces, and here it adds a hearty, deep background flavour to the freshness of the ripe tomatoes.</p>
<p class="indented">Although you can prepare the bread and the peppers an hour or so before you want to serve the soup, the aromas won’t be as profound as if you do it the night before.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 <strong><em>choricero</em></strong> peppers</p>
<p class="ingredients">700g tomatoes</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 large shallot (100g)</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g light dry white bread, crusts cut off</p>
<p class="ingredients">75ml olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">around 1 teaspoon sherry vinegar</p>
<p class="ingredients">¼ teaspoon <strong><em>pimentón dulce</em></strong> (mild paprika)</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="method">Soak the <em>choricero</em> peppers in a bowl of water overnight, then remove the stalks and seeds and carefully scrape the flesh away from the skin with a teaspoon. You should have around 70g of <em>choricero</em> flesh. Discard the skins.</p>
<p class="method">Roughly chop the tomatoes, shallot and bread and mix them together in a bowl or plastic food container with the olive oil, sherry vinegar, the <em>choricero</em> flesh, the <em>pimentón</em>, a pinch of salt and a twist of black pepper. Knead the mixture briefly to help the tomatoes release their juices. Cover the bowl with clingfilm and let the mixture marinate for at least 2 hours. Add a little more sherry vinegar if you like.</p>
<p class="method">Blend the mixture with 300ml of water for at least 2 minutes, until the <em>gazpacho</em> is completely smooth. Add another 200ml of water, blend again and taste, adding salt and possibly a drop more sherry vinegar if necessary.</p>
<p class="method">Pass the soup through a sieve or conical strainer and then put into the fridge for about 2 hours, until cold.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec52"><a id="pg_147"/>Ajo blanco</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Almond ‘<em>gazpacho</em>’</p>
<p class="flush_left">Although this cold almond soup has a name of its own, it is really part of the <em>gazpacho</em> family and, in fact, predates the better-known tomato one. Since I can’t resist almonds in any form, I love this soup, and during the summer we always have it on the menu at Tapas Brindisa, London Bridge.</p>
<p class="indented">If you want to add more oil, feel free – though make sure it is a really good, fruity, aromatic one. Rupert remembers the first time he made <em>ajo blanco</em>, many years ago, confusing millilitres with decilitres and ending up using a litre of Núñez de Prado olive oil, which he said made the soup absolutely delicious, if a little extravagant!</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g stale white bread, crusts cut off</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g blanched almonds</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 clove of garlic</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 teaspoons sherry vinegar</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="forhead">To serve</p>
<p class="ingredients">a few green grapes, halved</p>
<p class="method">Put all the ingredients except the seasoning into a food processor and pulse until the almonds and breadcrumbs are finely ground. Keep the processor running and pour in 600ml of water</p>
<p class="method">a little at a time. Taste and season as necessary and put into the fridge to chill. Serve very cold, garnished with the grapes.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec53">Contemporary gazpachos</p>
<p class="flush_left1">These next few recipes for <em>gazpacho</em> move closer to our modern approach to fruit and vegetable juices and smoothies. Creative Spanish cooks are preserving the essential fresh, cool simplicity of the classical soup, but taking out, or elaborating on, the subsistence elements of dry bread and oil, and replacing or enhancing them with more relevant modern twists.</p>
<p class="indented">While more traditional tomato-based <em>gazpachos</em> tend to benefit from being started the night before, fruit soups need to be made closer to serving – you just need to allow around 2 hours for chilling – as they lose colour, aroma and flavour very quickly.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec54"><a id="pg_148"/>Gazpacho de melón</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Melon <em>gazpacho</em></p>
<p class="flush_left">This is a very fresh <em>gazpacho</em> which our head chef, Leo Rivera, ensures is always on the summer menu at our South Kensington tapas bar, where he used to be in charge. It is delicate, thirst-quenching, mildly sweet and smooth with a luxurious edge from the fat of the cream: a nice light way to start a meal. I suggest serving it from cups and glasses for people to drink from, rather than bowls.</p>
<p class="indented">It should be made with a Galia or the elongated, green-skinned <em>piel de sapo</em> (‘toad skin’) melon, as a Cantaloupe or watermelon won’t produce the same consistency. You could try it with a Charentais melon, but the <em>gazpacho</em> will tend to be thicker, more like a <em>salmorejo</em> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_149">here</a>), and you will most likely need spoons to eat it.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 large melon, such as Galia or <strong><em>piel de sapo</em></strong></p>
<p class="ingredients">¼ teaspoon grated nutmeg</p>
<p class="ingredients">750ml single cream</p>
<p class="ingredients">a pinch of black pepper</p>
<p class="forhead"><strong><em>To serve</em></strong> (optional)</p>
<p class="ingredients">small pieces of melon (either scooped into balls, or cut into cubes and dipped, if you like, into a little port to give a contrasting colour)</p>
<p class="ingredients">small pieces of bacon, dry-fried until crispy</p>
<p class="method">Peel and de-seed the melon (keep a wedge back if using some for garnish) and blend until very smooth, then add the nutmeg and blend briefly. Strain through a fine sieve and put into the fridge to chill.</p>
<p class="method">Just before serving, beat in the cream and season with black pepper. Serve, if you like, with the melon pieces in port, if using, and/or small pieces of crispy bacon.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec55">Gazpacho de manzana</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Apple <em>gazpacho</em></p>
<p class="flush_left">This recipe was passed on to me by Rocío Muñoz González-Meneses, wife of Felipe Núñez de Prado of the pioneering olive oil family in Córdoba, with whom we have worked since the early nineties (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_218">here</a>). It is a favourite, made by a friend of hers, which seems perfect for the British table, since excellent apples are so much more abundant than ultra-ripe tomatoes.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4 generously</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec56"><a id="pg_149"/>Salmorejo</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Chilled cream of tomato from Córdoba</p>
<p class="flush_left">The home of <em>salmorejo</em> is Córdoba in Andalucía. Superficially it seems very similar to a tomato <em>gazpacho</em> – cold and tomato-red – however, the difference is that while it is still refreshing and nutritious, it is much thicker. Rocío Muñoz González-Meneses, of the Núñez de Prado olive oil producers in the region, defines <em>salmorejo</em> as a cream of vegetables, whereas she considers <em>gazpacho</em> to be closer to vegetable juice. I consider it almost a tomato spread, too thick to be drunk from a cup in the way that <em>gazpacho</em> can be served. So much so that it is often scooped up with additional pieces of bread, rather than with a spoon.</p>
<p class="indented">I have tasted many different <em>salmorejos,</em> some of which involve longer soaking of the bread, tomatoes and oil, but I have chosen this one from Ana Barrera (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_442">here</a>) because I love the fresh simplicity of it. In her Madrid restaurant she garnishes it only with some watercress, whose pepperiness works brilliantly with the flavour of ripe tomatoes (choose the ripest, most plump ones you can find). However, I also love the way that Rocío serves her <em>salmorejo</em> at Núñez de Prado, with chopped hard-boiled egg and <em>taquitos</em> (small pieces) of cured ham, with some of the family’s wonderful oil drizzled in a cross shape on top.</p>
<p class="indented">The quality of the olive oil you use is important. It should be stronger as opposed to mellow, and adding it very slowly is the key to a brighter colour and creamier texture.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 8–10</p>
<p class="ingredients">1.5kg tomatoes, quartered</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ an onion, chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 clove of garlic, green centre removed, crushed</p>

<p class="forhead">To serve</p>
<p class="ingredients">either a big bunch of watercress, or 1 hard-boiled egg and/or 80g good Spanish cured ham, preferably Ibérico</p>
<p class="method">Put all the ingredients except the oil into a bowl or plastic food container and put into the fridge for an hour to allow the bread to soak up the liquid and the aromas of the vinegar and the tomatoes.</p>
<p class="method">Blend, adding the oil a little at a time until you have the required texture in terms of thickness and silkiness – you may prefer to add more than 150ml – then put through a fine sieve. Chill for about 2 hours in the fridge.</p>
<p class="method">Serve in small bowls, scattered with the watercress. Or, if garnishing with egg and/or ham, grate the egg finely and scatter one or both over the <em>salmorejo.</em></p>

<p class="recipe-subhead">Almond and tomato <em>salmorejo</em></p>
<p class="flush_left">Another variation on one of Alberto Herráiz’s recipes, which combines my two absolute favourite soups: tomato and <em>ajo blanco</em>. The closest I have come to finding out why the dish is so called is that there is an Arabic word <em>zoco,</em> meaning a market, and as almonds were brought over by the Arabs to Spain this makes sense to me.</p>
<p class="indented">Choose the ripest, tastiest tomatoes you can find. Traditionally, the soup is served with grapes or little cubes of <em>piel de sapo</em> melon.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">420g tomatoes</p>
<p class="ingredients">60g bread, ideally a fluffy white bloomer, crusts cut off</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 tablespoons good olive oil, such as Arbequina</p>
<p class="ingredients">1½ tablespoons sherry vinegar</p>
<p class="ingredients">100g blanched almonds, preferably Marcona</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 clove of garlic</p>
<p class="ingredients">¼ teaspoon ground cumin</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="forhead">To serve</p>
<p class="ingredients">a few green grapes, halved, or little cubes of melon, preferably <strong><em>piel de sapo</em></strong></p>
<p class="method">Quarter the tomatoes and put into a mixing bowl. Wet the bread, then squeeze out any excess water and add to the tomatoes, along with half the olive oil, 1 tablespoon of sherry vinegar and the rest of the ingredients. Sprinkle in half a teaspoon of salt.</p>
<p class="method">Briefly knead the mixture to allow the juices of the tomato to meld with the other flavours, then cover the bowl with clingfilm and put into the fridge to marinate for at least 2 hours.</p>
<p class="method">Blend, then slowly add 450ml of water, blending for at least 2 more minutes until the <em>gazpacho</em> has a completely smooth consistency.</p>
<p class="method">Continue to blend as you add the remaining olive oil, to form an emulsion. Taste and add another pinch of salt as necessary, together with the rest of the sherry vinegar, briefly blending them in.</p>
<p class="method">Pass through a fine sieve into a serving bowl, and put into the fridge for about 2 hours until well chilled.</p>
<p class="method">Serve in bowls, accompanied by the grapes or cubes of melon, and a twist of black pepper.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec59"><a id="pg_153"/>Oliagua amb figues</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Rustic tomato soup with summer figs</p>
<p class="flush_left">This simple, but quite unusual, soup with its contrast of salty and sweet flavours is unique to Menorca. It is a favourite recipe given to me by our cheese <em>affineur</em> friends on the island, Nicolás and Rosa (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_25">here</a>), and it caused quite a stir of interest and approval when Rupert made it with the chefs at Brindisa.</p>
<p class="indented">Traditionally, many people would have had most of the fresh ingredients growing in their gardens, so this was a quick, economical and nourishing soup, which was often eaten for breakfast as well as supper.</p>
<p class="indented">Light and fresh, it must be related to <em>gazpacho</em>, but it is something of a halfway house between a hot and cold soup, as it is cooked – but mustn’t be allowed to boil – and then cooled until it is just tepid, but not chilled. What makes it especially distinctive is that it is served with fresh figs. The preferred local variety, common to both Menorca and Mallorca, is a slightly spiky fig known as <em>paratjal</em>, which is harvested quite late in September to October, when, thanks to the heat of the summer, tomatoes are still good and ripe – but, of course you can make the <em>oliagua</em> with any summer fig.</p>
<p class="indented">The soup is usually poured over lightly toasted garlicky bread in the base of the serving bowl (although you can cut the toast into croutons for garnishing if you prefer) – the reason for toasting the bread is to stop it from swelling and disintegrating when it is topped with the soup.</p>
<p class="indented">Try to use small, very ripe, super-red vine tomatoes, a flowery olive oil and very sweet figs.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">7 tablespoons olive oil, such as a fragrant Arbequina</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 large onion, diced</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 cloves of garlic, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 green pepper, diced</p>
<p class="ingredients">800g very ripe tomatoes, quartered</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon sugar, plus extra if necessary</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 sprig of thyme</p>
<p class="forhead">To serve</p>
<p class="ingredients">4 slices of white bread, toasted</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 cloves of garlic halved, for rubbing the bread</p>
<p class="ingredients">8 figs</p>
<p class="method">Pour the oil into a deep ceramic dish or heavy-based pot, warm gently, then stir in the onion and chopped garlic along with a pinch of salt. Let the oil bubble gently, stirring the onion for 5 minutes so that it poaches, rather than turning brown or crispy. Add the green pepper and let it poach in the same way for another 2 minutes.</p>
<p class="method">Stir in the tomatoes and squash them gently with the back of a spoon to help release their juices. Sprinkle in the sugar, pour in 600ml of water and submerge the sprig of thyme in the soup. Taste and adjust for salt or sugar.</p>
<p class="method">Place the pan on a diffuser, preferably, or otherwise the lowest heat possible, and allow the soup to heat through very gently for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. The secret is to make sure that it doesn’t come to the boil. After 30 minutes, remove from the heat and allow to cool, during which time the flavours will develop.</p>
<p class="method">Rub the toast with the halved cloves of garlic and place a slice at the bottom of each bowl, then ladle in the soup. Slice the figs and serve on the side.</p>
<h2 class="box-head" id="box6"><a id="pg_154"/>Life and Cooking with Ambro and Ásun</h2>
<p class="flush_left">I met cheese-maker Ambrosio (Ambro) Molinos when I bought my first raw sheep’s cheese from him in the village of Guzmán in Burgos province in Castilla y León, back in 1990. The cheese came in a tin and Ambro called it after the plateau where it was made: Páramo de Guzmán, 800–900 metres above sea level, where the winters are cold, the summers hot and dry, and where they also harvest grapes to make wine. In springtime the rain is frequent, but comes and goes quickly, driven on by the wind, and the velvety, undulating, green pasture underneath a big, open, clear sky reminds me more of Ireland than Spain.</p>
<p class="indented">That tin had a whole world inside it: Ambrosio’s world. Larger than life in every way, he is a great bear of a man, seven feet tall, the youngest and tallest of three brothers (one of whom is a hunter), with a big, booming voice. A generous-hearted rebel and philosopher, he plays the <em>charango</em> (a South American kind of lute) and is an outspoken upholder of his values and beliefs, from the superiority of the Churra breed of sheep to the abstinence from vegetables in his diet, or the need to patiently spend two hours making the best <em>bacalao (</em>salt cod) <em>al pil pil</em> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_332">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">He also eats an extraordinary number of eggs. At twelve he won his first egg-eating competition – devouring 45 fried hen’s eggs, and in a later contest took the title after eating 245 quail’s eggs. These days he is famous for his hearty tortillas (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_160">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">His elegant wife, Asun (short for Asunción), tells the story of how in the seventies the teenage Ambro, looking a bit like Che Guevara, with his long wild hair and beard, and in his bell-bottoms and <em>zuecos (</em>clogs), proclaimed his feelings for her in the middle of the street in Aranda de Duero, her home town. She told him he had no chance looking the way he did, so he tidied himself up and they were married six months later.</p>
<p class="indented">Both of them love to cook for friends and their family, which includes their spirited daughter, also called Asunción, whose stunning looks and clear vision of right and wrong turned heads when she spent time working with us at Brindisa in London. Now back in Spain, she creates installation art, whose theme is often a campaign for the rights of farmers and the rural economy, and a protest against intensification and pesticides. Her brothers, Enrique and Josué, care for the vines and make the wine as well as <a id="pg_155"/>harvesting cereal crops, fixing the tractors and doing all the backbreaking work around the farm.</p>
<p class="indented">It broke my heart when Ambro attempted to grow his cheese business and it all backfired, but the arable farming continues, and both he and Asun know they are lucky to have children who are committed to the land. While many of the elderly people in the village still work the fields in the way they have been doing since they were twelve or thirteen (in times when school was not obligatory), in a fast-changing world with different priorities and aspirations few of the young people want to stay and toil the land.</p>
<p class="indented">The family remain a great inspiration for me, and when I was researching recipes for this book, Asun and I spent a week cooking and swapping notes. With three big strong men with hearty appetites to feed every lunchtime, she has her work cut out, so we set off with our bags to the local weekly market to buy onions bigger than grapefruits, beautiful green tomatoes with streaks of red, voluptuous peppers, and big chickens <em>de corral</em>, strong free-range birds that require long cooking to tenderise the meat, ingredients for many different meals in one expedition. The butcher cut fresh pork from a vast leg, which we would marinate for kebabs, as well as fattier <em>aguja</em> (rib meat), minced for <em>picadillo,</em> and diced lamb, which would be served with a baked potato dish. He also deboned two legs of lamb for us to make <em>caldereta</em> (lamb stew, see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_435">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">In customary local fashion, before we could get home laden with our purchases we were invited for a mid-morning snack by friend and neighbour Manolo (Manuel) Pérez Pascuas, one of the three brothers who with their families run the Pérez Pascuas winery, and have been Ambro’s friends and neighbours since their youth, when they broke out of the local co-operative system to go their own way. Manolo’s ‘snack’ consisted of <em>lomo ibérico de bellota</em> (acorn-fed cured loin), artisan Zamorano cheese and <em>pan sobado,</em> the typical Castilian shallow and close-textured white loaf, with a seal pressed into its significant crust, together with a glass or two of their fine 2001 and 2003 Reservas. Finally, it was back to the house to begin cooking.</p>
<p class="indented">It is lamb that is the prime meat of the Burgos area and everything centres around it. Ambro remembers that when he was growing up in his village, where only about 100 people lived, the children were divided into three groups: north, east and south of the village, and each had their own games. Ambro believes that just as the history of man so far has been divided into BC and AD, in the future it will be marked as before and after TV. Before TV, a favourite of the children in his part of the village was <em>el juego de las tabas,</em> a bit like jacks, but played with the four small articulating knee bones (the <em>tabas</em>) of a milk-fed lamb, which you threw up in the air and scored points according to the way they landed. It was such a famous game in the region that there is a square in Valladolid decorated with <em>tabas</em> inset into the stones.</p>
<p class="indented"><a id="pg_156"/>Among the many dishes Asun and I cooked over the week were <em>caldereta, chilindrón (</em>chicken with red peppers) and <em>pepitoria</em> (a chicken dish, in which the sauce is thickened with almonds and hard-boiled egg yolk). She also showed me how she prepares <em>adobados</em> and <em>salmueras</em> – meats that are seasoned or marinated over a short or long time (at least 24 hours), depending on the way she wants to use the meat. In particular, she prepares her own salt cure for <em>costillas</em> (pork ribs), then keeps a stash of these in the freezer, ready to pull out whenever they are needed. We cooked some marinated ribs with chorizo and lentils and they were delicious (see <em>lentejas Asunción</em>, <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_398">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">The tradition of marinating, flavouring and semi-curing fresh meat at home goes back to the times when the family pig would be slaughtered once a year. Beyond the obvious curing of the legs for hams and the making of sausages, which would also be cured and dried, you needed to preserve other cuts since in those days before refrigeration, fresh meat would not last long. It would be cut into the required portions: chops, ribs, loin steaks, and the cures would either be dry (<em>adobos</em>) or wet (<em>salmuera</em>s) – the wet-curing would generally be used for meats that needed to be kept for longer. Once prepared, the meat would be stored in large ceramic jars, covered with lard or olive oil, or smoked and stored in the rafters in regions such as León and Asturias, where the smoking of hams and sausages was traditional.</p>
<p class="indented">These days, of course, there is no necessity to use these preparations, but many families like Ambro and Asun’s still do, as it is a way of tenderising the meat, and either mellowing the flavour in the case of game (the phrase is <em>quitar el bravio:</em> to take out the wildness) or adding flavour to industrially produced meats. You can also buy <em>adobados</em> done for you at some butchers’ counters in Spain.</p>
<p class="center_head">EASTER IN BURGOS</p>
<p class="flush_left">Our family spent one of our most memorable Easter holidays with Ambro and Asun. My only previous experience of a Spanish Easter was when I was in my twenties at the end of a road trip with friends from Catalunya to Sevilla. Easter in Sevilla was a huge thing – solemn, magnificent and emotive – whereas in the Burgos countryside the celebrations were much more modest, though just as heartfelt, involving days of preparation and cooking, followed by much feasting.</p>
<p class="indented">When we arrived at the house Ambro gave us a piece of rosemary branch that had been blessed in the church on Palm Sunday to be kept in the home for the rest of the year.</p>
<p class="indented">Then on Maundy Thursday we prepared generous quantities of <em>limonada</em>, the lemon aperitif made with <em>vino tinto</em> (red wine) that is traditionally drunk in the run-up to Easter Sunday – of course, <em>limonada</em> is the name for lemonade, which makes it sound far more innocent than it is. In Ambro’s cellar a fair amount of early <a id="pg_157"/>tasting is a serious task, and the men of all the local families heroically dropped by to test and check the balance of flavours, while Ásun prepared another of the special Easter treats, <em>torrijas de leche</em> (see <a href="chapter_005.html#pg_480">here</a>): slices of the local <em>pan sobado</em> soaked in warm milk, infused with sugar, cinnamon and lemon, ready to be dipped in beaten egg and fried, then sprinkled with more sugar – similar to French toast and full of flavours that remind you of childhood. <em>Sobar</em> means to knead, and <em>pan sobado</em> is bread that is hand-kneaded so that it has the right texture to absorb lots of milk without becoming mushy.</p>
<p class="indented">Maundy Thursday dinner was in the nearby town of Roa with Manolo Pérez Pascuas and his wife Juani González. We started in their <em>merendero</em>, the outdoor bar and eating space at their <em>bodega</em> in the village of Pedrosa, drinking our first cups of <em>limonada</em> with the ladies of the village before they attended the evening church service. Then it was into the back room of the local bar, for slow-cooked <em>bacalao</em> <em>a la taverna</em>. This is grilled salt cod in an emulsion of olive oil and garlic, similar to <em>pil pil</em> (see <a href="chapter_004.html#pg_332">here</a>) but made with fish still on the bone, from which the cod just falls away into the unctuous, tasty sauce. Adorned with slices of roasted red peppers, it was served in one of the vast earthenware dishes that are a speciality of the Zamoran town of Peruerela, along with a fresh salad and some fascinating vintages of Pedrosa wine.</p>
<p class="indented">Also dining were some of the local hunters, including Isidro el Bartolo, considered one of the best hunters of the village. A quiet man of the land, his name is really a mote (a nickname or byword), since he is the son of Bartolo, but no one actually knows his surname. With barely a word he passed me a bowl of the hare casserole the hunters were sharing: an amazingly dark, mysterious dish, full of tender, aromatic meat. It was so good that I have included a version of it see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_464">here</a>.</p>
<p class="indented">After midnight the whole village congregated in the front bar to play the traditional Maundy Thursday game of <em>chapas</em>, using <em>alfonsinas,</em> ten cent coins from the time of Alfonso XII. It was a riot of noise as the players bet on heads or tails as the coins were thrown in the air, sometimes losing and leaving, then returning again with a fistful of money, to try their luck in new rounds. When we left at 3 a.m. the game was still going strong.</p>
<p class="indented">At midday on Good Friday we headed to Ambro and Asun’s own <em>bodega</em>, overlooking Guzmán village and the flat-topped Manvirgo mountain. These <em>bodega</em>/caves abound in hilly regions throughout Spain. As with the <em>gofio</em> caves of the Canary Islands (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_60">here</a>), they usually have a chimney built into them, a fireplace to cook on, a gas ring, table and chairs and, as in this case, stone seats and tables outside to create a <em>merendero</em> for sunny days. Typically, they also have steps that lead down into a cool storage space, where families keep homemade preserves and olives, wines and <em>orujos</em> (liqueurs). At one time Ambro and Asun used to age their cheeses in their <em>bodega</em>, almost breaking their backs carrying them up and down <a id="pg_158"/>the steps. These retreats are favourite places for family and friends to gather, eat, drink, play music, sing and relax at weekends and on special holidays. Sometimes just the men of the village will escape to them for a few hours to sit around and tell stories in the way that people often sit around their sheds on allotments in Britain.</p>
<p class="indented">On Good Friday we sat outside on the warm stones, drinking <em>limonada</em> and dipping hunks of bread into our Easter lemon aperitifs (see recipes <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_159">here</a>) before cooking the traditional <em>revueltos</em> (scrambled egg) over an open fire – one pot with the addition of young garlic, just in season (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_140">here</a>), the other with tuna – and washed them down with tumblers of red wine, while Ambro played guitar and everyone sang.</p>
<p class="indented">On Easter Sunday morning we joined the procession around the village in which the men, in their best suits, carried the statue of the resurrected Jesus from the church, while the women carried the statue of the mourning Virgin Mary, her face and figure covered in a black cloak (<em>manta de luto)</em>, in the opposite direction. When eventually they were reunited the women sang, while, according to tradition, a representative of the church asked who would bid the most money to remove the mourning veil from the statue of Mary. After an intense auction the ladies who had pledged the winning bid removed the veil, kissed the Virgin – no longer <em>dolorosa</em>, but <em>feliz</em> in her newly revealed, brightly coloured dress – and the procession returned to the old church with its beautiful rickety wooden porch, for the Easter Mass.</p>
<p class="indented">And so finally, after <em>aperitivos</em> of <em>vermut (</em>vermouth) and a game of cards with the villagers, we sat down for the Easter meal, a feast of roast milk-fed lamb, shared once again with the Pérez Pascuas family.</p>

<p class="recipe-head2" id="reca5"><a id="pg_160"/>TORTILLAS</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead1">Omelettes</p>
<p class="flush_left">In Spain the combination of eggs and fried potatoes can move people to a passion that verges on the poetic. <em>Tortillas</em> have their place any time of day in the Spanish kitchen, but more often than not they are cut into slices or squares and served with drinks as a tapa.</p>
<p class="indented">Our friend Ambro (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_154">here</a>) makes a famous <em>tortilla</em> with 12 large eggs, which he proudly calls his <em>buenona</em>, an expression all of his own that conjures up something beautiful, warm and friendly. And Spanish cooks talk about the <em>cuajada</em>, a word borrowed from cheese-making that refers to the coagulation of the milk. In terms of a <em>tortilla</em> it describes the solidifying of the eggs to give just the right balance of firmness and <em>babosidad</em>: juiciness.</p>
<p class="indented">The problem is that there are too many experts all over Spain for us to know if there really is a definitive way to make a <em>tortilla</em>. Despite the fact that the classic recipe uses only four very basic and accessible ingredients – eggs, potatoes, onions and oil – a good <em>tortilla</em> is so much greater than the sum of its parts, so everybody has something to say about it: the ratio of eggs to potato, the kind of potato to use, the oil, whether to lightly fry the potatoes and onions so they retain the texture of a boiled potato; or whether to colour them so that they are slightly golden, or darker.</p>
<p class="indented">Knowing my fascination with the subject, Ambro and his wife, Asun, took me to meet Ciri González of La Encina restaurant in Palencia, Castilla y León, who is a three-time winner of the national <em>tortilla</em>-making competition known as the Campeonato de España de Tortillas de Patata. Her husband is also a stunning <em>asador</em> (specialist in roasting and grilling meat), who cooks suckling lamb in the traditional manner in a wood-burning <em>adobe</em> oven at the restaurant.</p>
<p class="indented">Ciri happily parted with some of the secrets that help her win championship after championship. She is totally specific about every ingredient. Because she wants as little moisture in the potatoes as possible, she uses only the Kennebec variety, grown locally and aged for a month after harvesting to dry the flesh out a <a id="pg_161"/>little, which she says gives just the right texture and a proper full potato flavour. The potatoes are also very thin-skinned, so she patiently rubs off the skins with a cloth, rather than using water, again to keep them as dry as possible, and she seasons them before cooking, as she says the seasoning penetrates better.</p>
<p class="indented">Ciri uses 8 eggs to 500g of potatoes (and half an onion), whereas most people use a lower proportion of eggs. Ambro uses 12 eggs to 1kg of potatoes for his <em>buenona</em>, and in our Brindisa kitchens we use 14 eggs to 2kg of potatoes. Ciri insists that the eggs must be <em>de corral</em> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_164">here</a>) and at room temperature, and she beats them very well.</p>
<p class="indented">The potatoes and onions for a <em>tortilla</em> should always be fried using olive oil. While some people like a neutral one, Ciri uses Picual de Jaén olive oil, which is a strong, characteristically bitter oil made from Picual olives in Jaén in Andalucía that is excellent for frying potatoes, as it enhances their flavour – at Brindisa we have some potato crisps fried in Picual oil, and they are unbelievably good.</p>
<p class="indented">She also likes her potatoes to be well ‘bronzed’, so she fries them for longer than most Spanish people I know. Our chefs at Brindisa, for example, insist that the potatoes should be more ‘cooked’ than ‘fried’ so they have the texture and taste of a baked potato – rather than a chip encased in egg – but Ciri goes for the opposite. However, she does it very slowly and cleverly so that she still retains the all-important juiciness inside the sliced potatoes. Then she drains them and the onions very well before adding to the beaten egg and leaves the mixture to amalgamate for at least 3 minutes before making the <em>tortilla.</em></p>
<p class="indented">The method I have given in the recipes that follow is the way I make <em>tortilla</em> at home, based on an amalgamation of tips from Ambro, Ciri and our own Brindisa chefs, who make around 100 <em>tortillas</em> each week, using more than 1,200 eggs and almost 150kg of potatoes.</p>
<p class="indented">I suggest that if you can’t find Kennebec potatoes, or the Galician Pataca, which also works well, you should try Yukon Gold, preferably, or Maris Piper, and when you peel them, dry them very well to reduce the moisture, as this really helps the texture. Personally, although I understand the attraction of a stronger oil, like Picual, I have always preferred a good but mild olive oil, such as Arbequina.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Some tortilla notes</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Use the very best eggs you can find and cook the onions in the traditional Spanish long, slow way, so that they become very, very soft and sweet. The onions and potatoes need to be drained very well after sautéing and before adding to the eggs, so that you don’t make the mixture too oily. I learned a good tip from one of our former head chefs, Esperanza Añonuevo Heys, who always uses a fine sieve, rather than a slotted spoon, to scoop the onions and potatoes from the oil, then balances this over a bowl, to let the oil drain away well.</p>
<p class="method">A very good, big frying pan of around 28cm diameter and 3–4cm deep is fundamental, and the other thing that is vital is to make sure that there is a good film of oil all around the sides of the pan, not just the base, to prevent sticking – but at the same time, be careful not to have too much oil, or the <em>tortilla</em> itself will become greasy, unless you are using a non-stick pan.</p>
<p class="method">The recipes that follow are for <em>tortillas</em> 3–4cm deep, but in our tapas bars we also make ones that are 10cm deep. If you want to make them this size, then a good tip from our chefs, to make sure the <em>tortilla</em> cooks all the way through without burning at the bottom, is to pour only half the mixture into the pan at first and stir it until it has the consistency of a nearly-cooked but still runny scrambled egg, then tip this back into the rest of your raw egg mixture and stir. Remove any egg that may have stuck to your frying pan, heat a little more oil and then put in all the egg mixture, flattening the surface gently with a spatula. Continue to let the <em>tortilla</em> set, and flip it over in the usual way.</p>
<p class="method"><a id="pg_162"/>You need a very large flat plate or a wooden <em>tortilla</em> turner for flipping over the <em>tortilla</em>. You can buy a <em>tortilla</em> turner in good kitchen shops or online. It is shaped like the lid of a pan and has a knob which you hold while you place it over the top of your frying pan, turn the two over so that the <em>tortilla</em> sits on the turner, then slide it back into the pan to cook the underside. Of course, you can do the same thing using a plate, but having the knob of the turner to hold on to just makes the movement easier and protects you a bit more against the heat of the pan and the <em>tortilla</em>.</p>
<p class="method">As I say, there is no steadfast rule about the ratio of potatoes and eggs – everyone has their own opinion. The recipes that follow give the ratio we use in our own Brindisa kitchens – but feel free to experiment and adapt.</p>
<p class="method">Whatever you settle on, making a really good <em>tortilla</em> takes practice, so I would recommend making it often and keeping it as a standby food for the next couple of days for everyone to tuck into a slice whenever they like – because that is the thing about <em>tortilla</em>: you need people to share it.</p>

The longer you cook them the sweeter they will be, so you can leave them for up to 1 hour if you have the time and a heat diffuser to place under the pan. Lift out with a slotted spoon, or preferably a small sieve, leaving the oil for cooking the potatoes. Drain the onion over a bowl, as you want it to be as free of excess oil as possible.</p>
<p class="method">Add the rest of the oil to the pan (it needs to be about 2cm deep). To test whether the oil is the right temperature, put in a small piece of potato. It should sizzle gently. Put in the potatoes, season and cook very slowly for about 20 minutes, moving the pieces around regularly from the middle to the edges so they cook through evenly, taking care not to let them burn. Some slices will break and stick to the pan, but that is inevitable. If you feel the potatoes are cooking too fast and getting too crispy, put a lid over the pan to allow them to steam a little and slow things down.</p>
<p class="method">When the potatoes are light golden and tender if you pierce them with the tip of a sharp knife, remove the pan from the heat, lift the potatoes out, again preferably with a small sieve, then <a id="pg_163"/>place this over a bowl, to drain off the excess oil.</p>
<p class="method">Measure around 4 tablespoons of the oil from the pan and pour it into a non-stick 28cm omelette pan 3–4cm deep.</p>
<p class="method">Once the potatoes are well drained, transfer them to a clean bowl. Beat the eggs, season and add them to the bowl, together with the drained onions.</p>
<p class="method">Heat the oil in the omelette pan, tilting it gently to make sure that the oil coats the sides as well as the base of the pan. Pour in the egg and potato mixture and begin to cook gently over a medium heat. For the next minute, keep moving some of the mixture from the centre to the outside to help it to cook evenly, then leave it alone to cook slowly, for about 10 minutes, keeping an eye on the edges to make sure they don’t burn, until the base is sealed and light golden – lift the base a little every so often to check whether it has reached this stage.</p>
<p class="method">Hold the pan over the sink, in case of leakage, and place a large plate or <em>tortilla</em> turner over the top. Turn the two over together so the <em>tortilla</em> lands on the plate or turner, cooked side upwards, hopefully with no pieces stuck to the pan.</p>
<p class="method">Make sure you still have a good film of oil in the pan – add a little more if necessary – then slide the <em>tortilla</em>, uncooked side downwards, into the pan and cook gently for 5 more minutes.</p>
<p class="method">When it is ready, the <em>tortilla</em> should be just firm, but still creamy inside. To check, press the surface near the centre, to make sure that no uncooked egg seeps out. Alternatively you can insert a skewer into the centre – it should have no uncooked egg on it when you withdraw it.</p>
<p class="method">Once the <em>tortilla</em> is ready, slide it on to a big, flat serving plate – or if you think the underside looks better, you could flip it over again – but don’t worry about perfect looks, it is the taste that matters.</p>

<p class="square-subhead">‘by the Easter weekend you would have masses’</p>
<p class="flush_left">At one time in Spain, when you bought eggs, you typically had two choices: <em>de corral</em> or <em>industrial</em>. <em>De corral</em> refers to the free-range, naturally reared and fed hens which run semi-wild in the enclosed yards or fields in and around Spanish villages and tend to be sold locally. Rupert remembers that when he was growing up in Madrid you hardly ever saw a proper country egg, except that occasionally a man used to come by his family’s house on a <em>vespino</em> (little motorbike), selling a basket of them, along with honey and <em>chorizos</em>, as well as offering haircuts!</p>
<p class="indented">These days good free-range and organic eggs can still be hard to find beyond the villages and small towns where they are produced, but they are slowly becoming easier to source and gradually beginning to command the price they deserve. This is often because more young people are going back to family land that they had previously abandoned, focusing on alternative and specialised food production, and selling via websites, as a small rebellion against the supermarkets that have grown up in Spain as much as anywhere else.</p>
<p class="indented">Quail’s eggs are also popular in tapas, either hard-boiled and dipped in a spicy mixture of salt and <em>pimentón</em> (paprika), or fried and served on top of a strip of fried green pepper, or spicy <em>picadillo</em> (minced pork), on toast to make bite-sized <em>montaditos</em>.</p>
<p class="indented">Hen's eggs used to be almost seasonal, because light stimulates the birds to lay, and before the invention of electric lighting it was daylight that they set their laying clocks by. So from spring, when the days started to grow longer, through summer, there would always be more eggs. Add to this the fact that it was forbidden to eat eggs during Lent in the Middle Ages, and by the Easter weekend you would have masses to use up. There is a tradition of cooked eggs at Easter time – either hard-boiled or, on Good Friday, <em>revueltos</em> (scrambled eggs), sometimes made with young garlic shoots (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_140">here</a>) and sometimes with tuna, washed down with red wine.</p>
<p class="indented">One autumn when I was staying at the hotel Convento de Santa Clara, a converted convent in Alcázar de San Juan, La Mancha, I saw bowls of eggs everywhere. When I asked their significance, I was told that whenever there was a family wedding being planned, the villagers would traditionally bring eggs to the convent, in exchange for prayers to keep the rain away. The belief was so strong that in years when the countryside was very short of rain, notably during the droughts of 2007, the convent would not accept any eggs for fear that they would prolong the drought.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec64"><a id="pg_166"/>Pastel de escorpora con albahaca</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Light ‘loaf’ of gurnard with tomato and basil dressing</p>
<p class="flush_left"><em>Pastels</em> or mousse-like ‘loaf’ cakes are rather out of fashion in the UK, having been a big hit in the seventies, but they are still very popular in parts of Spain. Pepa Salvador had this one on the menu at La Salsita on the Costa Brava when I worked there, and making it again after all these years has convinced me that such recipes are due a comeback. It is full of the subtle, delicate flavours of egg, tomato, fish and basil and it makes a great wholesome family lunch or supper, put out with other small plates, as everyone can simply help themselves to a slice or two.</p>
<p class="indented">If you have good ripe, flavoursome tomatoes it is worth the effort of making your own tomato <em>sofrito</em> as in this recipe, rather than using a jarred one, as the fresh flavours will contribute to the lightness and sophistication of the mousse. If you do use a jarred one, however, you will need about 300g.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">5 eggs</p>
<p class="ingredients">a pinch of salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">120ml full-cream milk</p>
<p class="ingredients">120ml double cream</p>
<p class="forhead">For the tomato sofrito</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 large onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">500g tomatoes, grated</p>
<p class="ingredients">a pinch of sugar, to taste</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt, to taste</p>
<p class="forhead">For the poached gurnard</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 onion, cut in half</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 carrot, cut in half</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 cloves of garlic, each cut in half</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 whole gurnard (600–800g), cleaned</p>
<p class="forhead">For the dressing</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tomato</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon chopped basil</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon lemon juice</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="forhead">To prepare the loaf tin</p>
<p class="ingredients">10g butter</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons breadcrumbs</p>
<p class="method">First make the <em>sofrito.</em> Heat the oil in the pan and add the onion. Cook very gently over a low heat until golden brown. Add the grated tomato, bring to a boil and then turn down the heat and allow to simmer for 1 hour, until you have a sauce that has reduced by around a third to a half in volume. Taste and adjust with a pinch of sugar or salt if necessary. Take off the heat and leave to cool.</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas 4.</p>
<p class="method">To poach the fish pour 2 litres of water into a large pan, add the salt, vegetables and garlic and bring to just under the boil – to the point where you can <a id="pg_167"/>see bubbles beginning to form on the base of the pan – then put in the gurnard. Keep at a gentle simmer for 15–20 minutes, depending on the size of the fish (don’t let the water boil or it will break up the fish). The fish is ready when the flesh peels away from the bone.</p>
<p class="method">Drain off the water, lift out the fish carefully and gently take the fillets from the spine. Flake the fish into pieces of around 2cm, removing any smaller bones, and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Grease a loaf tin of around 23cm x 12cm with the butter. Tip in the breadcrumbs and tilt the tin until they cover the whole of the inside. Put the tin into the roasting pan.</p>
<p class="method">In a large bowl, beat the eggs, adding the salt, then begin to fold in the <em>sofrito</em>, flaked gurnard, the milk and the cream. Make sure the ingredients are mixed well, but go gently so that you keep the flakes of fish intact. Spoon into the prepared loaf tin.</p>
<p class="method">Fill the roasting pan with hot water until it reaches about three-quarters of the way up the outside of the loaf tin. Put into the preheated oven for about 20 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.</p>
<p class="method">To make the dressing, grate the tomato into a bowl, add the chopped basil, olive oil and lemon juice, season with a pinch of salt and a twist of black pepper, stir and adjust to taste.</p>
<p class="method">Turn the loaf out of its mould, slice, and serve with the tomato dressing.</p>

<p class="square-subhead">‘ a big story’</p>
<p class="flush_left">The simplest tapa of all is a plate of finely carved Spanish ham – the quintessential one being <em>de bellota</em> <em>Ib</em>é<em>rico</em>, which comes from the special black-footed, acorn-fed pigs that roam the forests and hills of the Dehesa in south-west Spain. I don’t think the ham needs anything else to adorn it, except perhaps a bowl of almonds or olives, put out separately. I like it with just a good <em>fino</em> sherry, but typically it is also paired with wine or champagne, which curiously I think works better with it than <em>cava</em>. However, our good friend and expert on hams, Germán Arroyo Duque, who comes from the heart of the Dehesa, likes the ham served in the local way, with good bread and a refreshing beer.</p>
<p class="indented">If I could total up the number of hams that I have seen hanging in silent rooms across Spain it would run into hundreds of thousands. Over the years, I and my colleagues have visited some of the most prestigious, as well as the most humble of curing rooms, and experience has shown us that great hams or average hams can be produced in both. The whole process of curing and hanging can take up to four years or more, and every stage counts, so it is possible for the ham from a great animal to be spoilt by poor practice, while that from an ordinary animal might be immensely improved by diligent attention to detail.</p>
<p class="indented">For us, ham is a big story which really began in 1992, when the EU was formed and in Brussels the bureaucrats were finalising the details of the invasion of Spanish ham into member states – at least that is the way its arrival was perceived by its competitors in the world of charcuterie. Although I am sure some ham slipped quietly across the borders, until 1992 no ham was officially allowed to be exported from Spain, so the owners of Spanish bars and restaurants in other countries had to use Italian Parma ham. Even when the first shipments of legal Serrano ham arrived from Spain, many such establishments continued to use the name Parma on their menus because it had become accepted and synonymous with quality, and they feared they might lose custom if they mentioned the hitherto unknown Serrano.</p>
<p class="indented">It has to be recognised that in Spain the production of pork, hams and sausages is on a very large scale, so inevitably when we ordered our first Serrano hams approved for export in 1990, these were not produced by small artisans, but by bigger companies which had the resources to expand and tick all the right boxes.</p>
<p class="indented">There was also a long and frustrating wait for them. A ham takes at least a year, sometimes three, to cure, and the legislation said that the meat had to be from animals slaughtered after 1990, so it was two more years before we received the hams. Later, in the mid-nineties, when we began importing our first Ibérico hams we had <a id="pg_170"/>to go through a similar waiting process, only receiving our first prized hams in 1998.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_169"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg169.jpg"/></div>
<p class="indented">As incompatible as these semi-industrial hams felt alongside the farm-made Churra sheep’s milk cheeses and other artisan produce that we were bringing in from Spain, I badly wanted to sell Spanish ham. And although those early examples, from Large White pigs crossed with Durocs, may not have been as specialist as those we can source today, they were still a delightful, novel experience for most British people: a rich red colour, with a more pronounced flavour than their Italian equivalents.</p>
<p class="indented">Steve Carter and Richard Corrigan, who were then the chefs at Stephen Bull’s restaurants, were the first to offer platters of Spanish hams and other cured meats, along with cheese, olives and peppers, which were a big success.</p>
<p class="indented">Once the market opened up, we were able to become properly selective and begin forging real relationships with favourite producers. Ultimately, there is no substitute for this. Only through getting to know the farming, husbandry and curing processes can you understand what makes a truly great ham.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">An ancient technique</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Wherever ham is cured the process is similar, and in essence the process hasn’t substantially changed since the days when villagers would fatten up a piglet each year, slaughter it in winter, salt a leg in a stone basin in the coolest part of the house, then hang it up in the eaves to cure and mature, ready to feed the family.</p>
<p class="indented">Traditionally, cured hams were more the product of mountainous regions, where, at altitude, the dry winds naturally cured them slowly and fully. Nowadays, however, it is possible to create any environment you want to cure the meat to your own specifications.</p>
<p class="indented">What varies from region to region, and producer to producer, is the breed of animal, its diet and quality of life, whether it has run free or lived in a shed. It may have foraged for wild food, or been given compound feed, or a mix of the two. These factors will affect or determine the length of time that the ham will improve during curing, and the characteristics and organoleptic qualities it will develop. The way the animals are handled immediately before and during slaughter will also have an effect, since stress produces lactic acid in the meat, which is not conducive to good curing.</p>
<p class="indented">In the time-honoured way, the process of curing begins with the selection of a fresh back leg from the pig, which is placed in salt. Non-Ibérico hams tend to be salted for one day per kilo, so an average 9kg leg will be salted for nine days; whereas an Ibérico ham will be salted for 12 days. The salting has the effect of separating the protein filaments and weakening the muscle fibres, which in turn dehydrates the meat, darkening it and beginning the process of fermentation, which concentrates the flavour.</p>
<p class="indented">After salting, the legs are washed, then dried off for a period of time in chilled chambers, before being hung in the curing rooms.</p>
<p class="indented">Originally, ham-curing was done according to the seasons, which 100 years ago were more reliable and distinct. The ham would be hung up in winter, in chambers with windows which could be opened and closed to control the cold winds blowing through, and the flora that had built up in the building over years and years would develop naturally on the skin. Then, when the temperature rose in spring and summer, the hams, while still protected from decay by the salt, would start the <em>sudado</em> (the sweating), or warm phase, during which the flavours of the ham really begin to open up and develop and the hams lose fat – over a third of their original weight. In the old days the floors of the curing rooms would be covered in so much shiny fat that they looked like ice rinks until sawdust was laid down in order to soak it up.</p>
<p class="indented">Nowadays, though some traditional producers still follow the seasons, opening or closing shutters, depending on the dryness or dampness of the air and the strength of the wind and its temperature, the climatic change is mostly mimicked in false – though usually <a id="pg_171"/>less picturesque – chambers in which the temperature and humidity can be accurately controlled. Even if the outside air is blown through, using fans, it contributes less to the curing process than in the old, seasonal days. For most producers the benefits of being in total control of the environment in which their hams cure far outweigh the romance of seasonality.</p>
<p class="indented">Finally, the ham is taken to the natural cellars for <em>asentamiento,</em> or ‘settling’, at a constant temperature. This will be at least nine months, but could be up to four or five years for the finest acorn-fed Ibérico hams, after which time even the best will not improve, but may even begin to dry out. At the end of the process a skilled <em>calador</em> pierces the ham in three strategic places with a thin veal bone called <em>la cala</em>, which picks up all the aromas inside, enabling the <em>calador</em> to check that there are no faults.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Serrano ham</h4>
<p class="flush_left">This is air-cured ham from a selection of cross-bred white pigs, such as the Duroc. The name Serrano simply means mountain ham, coming as it does from the word <em>sierra</em> (mountain range), and although it has become quite a loose colloquial term for any cured ham other than Ibérico (see <a href="chapter_003.html#p172a">here</a>), the name is protected by the EU under the term TSG (Traditional Speciality Guaranteed).</p>
<p class="indented">After many years we have settled very happily on the traditional area of Aragón for our cured Serrano ham. It is one of the most undiscovered areas of Spain, a landlocked province stretching from the French border in the Pyrenees to Valencia, underpopulated and wild. The high plateau of the Teruel province, where the hams are produced, has the perfect climate for producing hams – biting winds and dry air in winter, and open uninterrupted landscape so the curing rooms can be lined up at the best angle for introducing the air at the first stage of curing.</p>
<p class="indented">Being so isolated, the committed Teruel ham community has built a kind of self-sufficiency that is very productive: they grow and mix their own feed for the pigs (which are kept in barns to protect them from sunburn in these shadeless areas), and even run a co-operative system for the purchasing of domestic items such as washing machines, allowing income to flow fairly and help life run more smoothly.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">How to choose Serrano ham</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Within the TSG mark, local regulating boards can set their own criteria, and you will see many different labels which will be more or less demanding, so the quality can range from ordinary to excellent.</p>
<p class="method">When you buy Serrano ham you should be looking for a deep pink colour, with less of a marbling of fat than an Ibérico ham, a sweet aroma, a strong savoury umami taste and a distinct presence of salt.</p>
<p class="method">Although sliced ham, interleaved in packets, is convenient and easy to find, it is always better to buy it freshly sliced if you can. The slices will keep for a few days in the fridge, wrapped in clingfilm, and won’t have the plastic look and smell of packaged ham.</p>
<p class="method">If you do buy a ready-sliced pack, ideally choose one that has the origin stated on it – for example, Teruel or Trevelez – and preferably the age of the ham. As with many foods, you will often see rather vague terms on packets, such as <em>bodega</em>, air-dried, special reserve, or farm assured, which are genuine attempts to communicate the characteristics of the ham; however, they don’t actually guarantee all the quality criteria required for an excellent ham. Ultimately, it is a case of tasting to discover the one you like best.</p>
<p class="method">Whichever way you buy your ham, always bring it to room temperature before eating, in order to experience the full flavour.</p>
<h4 class="c_head"><a id="pg_172"/>Ibérico ham</h4>
<p class="flush_left">This is the most highly prized air-dried ham, from animals descended from the ancient breed of wild black Ibérico pig, which has characteristically long slender legs, a long snout to forage with, and a dark skin to help protect it in the sun. The ham it produces is popularly known as <em>pata negra</em>, referring to the black hoof which stays on the slim leg like a pointed shoe throughout the curing process and makes it look very different from other hams.</p>
<p class="indented">Pigs with 100% Ibérico parentage, brought up in the wild and fed on acorns, can produce hams that are quite sublime. However, not all Ibérico ham is produced from pure-bred, acorn-fed pigs. Nor does it necessarily taste sublime. The demand for Spain’s most luxurious meat is growing fast and methods are intensifying, so while you still have small farmers producing only a few thousand hams in a year and controlling everything from the breeding and rearing of the animals to the curing and maturing, there are also big companies slaughtering 1,000 animals a week.</p>
<p class="indented">In these more intensive systems the pigs may still have access to some acorns, but others will have been raised solely on industrial feed. Even if they have been outdoor reared on farms they will not have had to course the hills foraging for food in the way of those labelled <em>de bellota</em> <em>100%</em> <em>ibérico</em>, and without this phase of their development leading into the <em>montanera</em> (acorn-fattening), the ham won’t be as elegantly streaked with translucent fat, nor will it have the aroma or sublime, naturally nutty flavour, with all its small but important nuances.</p>
<p class="indented">However, since genetics and breeding still play a big part, the hams will often be very good, although due to the lesser quality of their fat they cannot be cured for as long as those from animals who have fed in the wild and foraged on acorns. Eighteen months is a good length of cure for the best of the hams, and those from animals reared out of doors will be reddish in colour and gently marbled, with a fruity aroma – peachy with a hint of golden plums or melon – and will be mildly sweet while retaining a good touch of salt, so the flavour is round in the mouth with a long finish. Ultimately, however, the quality may not be that different to an excellent Serrano ham.</p>
<p class="indented">To help give consumers more information about the way the pigs have been reared and fed, Ibérico ham is divided into four classes: <em>de bellota 100% ibérico</em>, <em>de bellota ibérico,</em> <em>de cebo de campo ibérico</em>, and <em>de cebo ibérico.</em> New regulations are also being phased in, which will colour-code each whole ham slaughtered since 2014. In addition to displaying the name, race and rearing and feed details of the pig, the hams must be colour-coded with non-removable tags in the slaughterhouse: black for <em>de bellota 100% ibérico</em>, red for <em>de bellota ib</em>é<em>rico</em>, green for <em>de cebo de campo ib</em>é<em>rico</em> and white for <em>de cebo ib</em>é<em>rico</em>. However, the best <em>de bellota</em> hams, which have the longest cures, will not appear with these coloured tags until around 2018.</p>
<h4 class="c_head" id="p172a">De bellota 100% ibérico</h4>
<p class="flush_left">This is the ultimate ham, from a pig that has 100 per cent Ibérico parentage. The animals must have been brought up wild in the oak forests without any grain supplements during their autumn <em>montanera</em>, when they gorge and fatten on acorns. They will have also been slaughtered immediately after the <em>montanera.</em> This is ham that has to be tasted to understand just how aromatic, silky, sweet and long-tasting it can be, and to appreciate that it is all about the ‘good’ fat which is the key to the texture and flavour. Yes, it is expensive, but you need only a few ultra-fine slivers to savour the experience.</p>
<p class="indented">The pigs spend all their lives in the wild of the Dehesa, a vast ecosystem encompassing swathes of forest, pasture, hills and plains in south-western Spain where the pigs forage on acorns from the <em>encina</em> (the evergreen holm oak), the <em>quejigo</em> oak and the <em>alcornoque</em> (cork oak), along with grasses and herbs and other natural forest food, which build up the silky, tasty translucent fat that streaks through the deep crimson and light purple colours of the finest hams.</p>
<p class="indented"><a id="pg_173"/>It is the varied topography of the Dehesa that is crucial to determining the quality of the animals, and ultimately the hams. The best scenario for a producer of <em>de bellota ibérico</em> ham is to have a good extent of land both up in the hills, with big distances between water pools, and down in the plain, with access to the best acorns. This way the nimble, agile pigs can spend their summers rummaging and foraging on the hilltops, keeping fit running up and down, negotiating rocks, and sometimes covering as many as 40 kilometres in a day as they search for something to eat and scurry from water pool to water pool in heat that can reach 40°C. As a result they develop strong thin legs, big thighs and a bone structure that will support their weight once they are moved down to the plains for the <em>montanera,</em> or fattening phase, in which they spend the last three or four months of their lives gorging on acorns.</p>
<p class="indented">During the <em>montanera</em>, producers use skilled swine herders to guide the pigs towards the concentration of the best and sweetest acorns that have fallen from the oak trees. Following their energetic summer, the superbly fit pigs go crazy for them, gorging not only on the acorns, but on grasses from the <em>gramíneas</em> plant family, and clover, in particular, which is important in producing the best fat, along with wild purslane and legumes such as lentils, which have been strategically planted in the wild. At this stage of their lives the pigs are bulking up for winter, when the temperatures can plummet to below zero, and an average animal will eat 7kg of acorns and 3kg of grasses a day, sadly not knowing that such luxuries makes them perfect for the January slaughter and curing process.</p>
<p class="indented">In this crucial fattening phase the animals are expected to double their weight and the increase is monitored weekly to ensure the pigs are taking up the maximum amount of food needed. Quaintly, their weight is measured in <em>arrobas</em>, the old Spanish unit that country folk still use sometimes – each <em>arroba</em> equals about 11.5kg. Amusingly, the younger generation in Spain know the word as the @ symbol for emails.</p>
<p class="indented">The two classifications of acorn-fed ham refer mainly to the breeding of the pig. The highest classification, <em>de bellota</em> <em>100%</em> <em>ibérico,</em> signifies that both parents were also 100 per cent Ibérico, while <em>de bellota</em> <em>ibérico</em> allows for a lower percentage of Ibérico in the breed, which is reflected in the quality of the ham. The purer the breed, the better the pig will be at absorbing the all-important acorn oils and allowing the fats to infiltrate the meat.</p>
<p class="indented">The best hams also vary with their ‘vintage’ or season, just like good wines, oils and cheeses. When you talk about a ham’s season, this is the winter in which the pig was slaughtered (even though it may not actually be on sale for another two or three years, after the curing process), and a pig farmer is always hoping for ideal conditions in the autumn leading up to slaughter: gentle temperatures and enough rainfall to produce lush grasses, forest flowers and emerald green acorns which will mature to dark brown as the season goes into a dry, cold winter.</p>
<p class="indented">It is the acorns that are the real key to the intense, sweet, nutty aromas of the ham and the characteristic low-cholesterol, silky, melting, lubricating fat that runs through the finished ham in thin lines. This is what makes the flavour of the ham so complex and unctuously tasty, so it should always be eaten along with the lean, and never cut out or thrown away. When we first started bringing in <em>de bellota</em> <em>ibérico</em> ham, before there was any real acceptance or understanding of it in Britain, I gave a wonderful ham to chef Simon Hopkinson, then at Bibendum, who was very excited by the arrival of this delicacy. His instincts were right: he simply sliced it and sent it out to diners, but the plates came back with the fat trimmed off and customers wanting to know why it was there. I was duly called over to the restaurant to confirm that the ratio of fat to lean was perfectly normal and exactly as it should be.</p>
<p class="indented">It was an absurd misunderstanding of a fine product that seemed so characteristic of modern meat production and consumption, which has all fat marked out by many people as almost criminal. Simon did, however, have one customer <a id="pg_174"/>who genuinely appreciated and understood fine fat: the late great artist Francis Bacon. Simon saved up all the trimmings that the other customers had eschewed and offered them to him to top up his own slices of the ham, and they were enjoyed with great gusto.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">De bellota ibérico</h4>
<p class="flush_left">This denotes cross-breed animals, i.e. Ibérico crossed with Duroc pigs. A pig can have as little as 50 per cent Ibérico genes (it must have a 100 per cent Ibérico mother, but could have a father who is 100 per cent Duroc or an Ibérico–Duroc cross) but this information, including the percentage of Ibérico, must appear on the ham’s labelling. Apart from their breeding, however, these animals will have enjoyed the same exceptional lifestyle as the <em>de bellota</em> <em>100% ibérico</em> pigs.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">De cebo de campo ibérico</h4>
<p class="flush_left">A ham from a cross-breed animal that has been raised outdoors but not necessarily across the large hills and woodland enjoyed by <em>bellota</em> pigs. Often the animals will have been brought up on a farm that is more intensive and without the space or acorn-quota per animal that the two <em>de bellota</em> grades require. The pigs will have been given a compound feed of cereals and pulses during the <em>montanera</em> fattening season, even if they have some access to acorns.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">De cebo ibérico</h4>
<p class="flush_left">This is the label for hams which originate from cross-breed animals that are reared intensively and are entirely grain-fed with very limited space in which to move, both of which factors are significant in terms of the quality of the hams.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">How to choose <strong><em>de bellota ibérico</em></strong> ham</h4>
<p class="flush_left">First of all be sure that what you are buying is genuine Ibérico. Until the new labelling system is fully phased in, the safest way is to actually see the ham being carved in front of you, as you can tell an Ibérico ham by the long elegant leg ending in a pointed black hoof. If the ham has a fat ankle and no black hoof, it doesn’t mean it is a bad ham, but it won’t be the genuine article.</p>
<p class="method">Beyond this, you can tell that the ham is <em>de bellota ibérico</em> by the quality of the fat, which should melt at body temperature. Ask for a sliver of ham to be cut for you, warm it between your fingers and the fat should become meltingly soft.</p>
<p class="method">All <em>de bellota ibérico</em> hams must be produced to official and traceable criteria; however, the very best producers will choose to exceed these, taking their hams to an eating experience that really blows the mind and makes the high price seem almost irrelevant. In the best vintages, a ham will have a deep crimson/purple colour and a delicate marbling of fat with a smooth, silky texture that melts on the tongue. In exceptional hams, when they are warm, experts sometimes claim to identify anything from 70 to 120 different aromas, from fresh hazelnuts, crisp apple and sweet melon to flowers, butter and grasses.</p>
<p class="method">Depending on whether you buy ham from the north or the south of the production area, the flavour will tend to be subtly different. As a general rule, the further south of the production area you go, the slightly saltier the ham will be.</p>
<p class="method">Due also to the cooler temperatures, northern hams can be cured for longer than in the south and will maintain their juiciness more easily. Ours come from the area of Guijuelo, where the hams can be cured for about four years and will continue to improve during this time. The very best hams from Guijuelo have always been my favourite, as they are balanced and aromatic with a long flavour: not as immediately appealing as the southern hams, perhaps, but more subtle. <a id="pg_175"/>The meat is deep red and well marbled, almost as sweet as honey on the palate, with some flavours of walnuts and almonds coming through. The hams tend to have a very silky texture and a fat that is translucent when warm and which literally melts away on your palate.</p>
<p class="method">Hams from the south have an extraordinary ability to instantly impress, but lesser ones may turn out to be one-dimensional and often a little dry; however, the good ones carry the initial savoury experience on into a greater complexity and long flavour. Our hams, from Extremadura and Huelva, are deep burgundy red and well marbled, with a profound aroma that is a combination of honey, chocolate and coffee, with hints of smoky nuts and earthiness, and the flavour is markedly more savoury: sun-dried tomatoes, hazelnuts and chestnuts. The fat is very silky, and the finish slightly peppery and complex. In one slice you can experience sweetness, saltiness, creaminess and nuttiness.</p>
<p class="method">Occasionally you might see <em>tirosinas</em>: white dots that appear in the lean meat of Ibérico ham – these are just amino acids of proteins that are part of the meat and have crystallised as a natural consequence of the disappearance of water and humidity during the later stages of curing, which has stopped them from dissolving. They can be a sign of maturity and decent curing.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Carving and serving</h4>
<p class="flush_left"><em>De bellota ibérico</em> ham should always be served at room temperature, around 20–25°C, so that the fat can warm up and soften and lubricate the flesh, making it beautifully succulent and allowing all the extra dimensions and nuances of sweet flavours and aromas to develop and travel throughout the ham. In Spain the hams that are in use will always sit on the carving stand on the bar or in the restaurants, and when one is becoming close to the bone the next one will be taken from the cellar or ambient store and be waiting and warming, ready to take over. After the first carving, the cut surface of the ham will be rubbed with the removed outer layer of white fat and covered with it, and then the whole ham will be tightly and completely wrapped in layers of clingfilm to press the fat on to the cut surface and prevent the meat from drying out.</p>
<p class="indented">At Brindisa we were the first to bring Spanish hams on the bone into the UK, so we also had to convince the environmental health officers that this is the way whole hams should be kept, rather than in the fridge. We had to supply a wealth of technical information from Spain to show that dramatic changes in temperature are the enemy of hams on the bone, drying them out; while, conversely, refrigeration can let damp into the bone via the hoof, which will spoil the flesh.</p>
<p class="indented">The carving of these hams is an art which takes into account the anatomy of the leg and an understanding of where the more sweet or savoury cuts lie. So we also brought over a string of Spain’s best carvers, who were wonderful, colourful characters, quite diva-like, since they are celebrated as superstars at home and abroad. Since then we have set up our own school at our Borough Market shop, run by master carvers, which is hugely popular with customers who want to buy whole hams.</p>
<p class="indented">Most people, however, buy their ham carved for them in the shop. Once off the bone, you can keep it in the fridge, but always take it out around 4–6 hours before you want to serve it, so that it can warm up slowly to room temperature.</p>
<h4 class="c_head" id="p175a">Tacos and taquitos de jamón</h4>
<p class="flush_left">Often in Spain butchers and deli counters will sell the offcuts from the end of carving a Serrano or Ibérico ham. These are called <em>tacos</em>, or <em>taquitos</em>, depending on their size. The bigger <em>tacos</em> are perfect for adding to <em>revueltos</em> (scrambled eggs, see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_264">here</a>), <em>croquetas</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_241">here</a>) or stews, while the smaller <em>taquitos</em> (almost minced), are great for filling out meatballs or garnishing <em>salmorejo</em> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_149">here</a>), etc. Of course, you can cut up pieces of ham yourself; however, because its texture is so soft, it is not easy to do it finely.</p>
<div class="diamond-image"><a id="pg_176"/><img alt="image" class="width50" src="../images/pg176.jpg"/></div>
<p class="square-subhead">'every region will have its local favourites'</p>
<p class="flush_left">Ham is inevitably the hero of every cured meat plate throughout Spain, but also every region will have its local favourites which will feature alongside it. This is a selection of some of the most interesting.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Lomo en manteca colorá or blanca</h4>
<p class="flush_left">This is pork that is marinated in black pepper, garlic and sometimes vinegar to tenderise it, then slowly cooked, confit-style, in lard, which is either white, or seasoned with <em>pimentón</em> (paprika). Alternatively, paprika may be included in the marinade to avoid any bitterness from overheating. Then the pork, which by now is incredibly tender, is cooled and stored in the lard. In days gone by families would have kept it in an earthenware jar (<em>orza</em>) where it would last for a number of months. This would have been a typical way to use up the trimmings of prime loin after the winter slaughter of the family pig. <em>Lomo en manteca</em> can be just sliced cold and the lard spread like butter on crusty bread.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Lomo doblado or doblao</h4>
<p class="flush_left">This is stunning, especially when made from acorn-gorging Ibérico pigs. The loin is folded, or doubled – hence the name – over a piece of lard which is seasoned with salt, pepper and a touch of garlic, so that as the meat cures it melds together and becomes almost like a wide sausage that is shorter but twice as thick as the usual cured <em>lomo</em>. Because of this extra thickness, <em>lomo doblado</em> requires longer curing of at least 6 months, and as a result it is quite luxurious with its marbled lard centre and a flavour that is reminiscent of ham.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Lomo embuchado</h4>
<p class="flush_left">The back loin of pork, seasoned with salt, paprika and oregano, then lightly dried over oak fires, which give it a gentle smokiness. When the cut comes from an Ibérico pig (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_168">here</a>) it is usually known as <em>cañ</em><em>a de lomo</em>, and can be sublime, delicately streaked with sweet fat. It is eaten thinly sliced, on its own.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Cabezada de lomo</h4>
<p class="flush_left">The end of the back loin which attaches to the shoulder of the animal. It is cured in the same way as <em>lomo embuchado</em> or <em>caña de lomo,</em> but because of its smaller size the curing is done <a id="pg_178"/>over a shorter time and as a result its flavour is less developed, and its texture less consistent, so while it can be very silky it can also be a little dry.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_177"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg177.jpg"/></div>
<h4 class="c_head">Morcón</h4>
<p class="flush_left">This can include lean and fat from anywhere on the pig, especially the head and neck cuts, coarsely chopped and then cured in a stomach or bladder casing. It is typical of western areas such as Extremadura.</p>
<h4 class="c_head" id="pg177a">Cecina</h4>
<p class="flush_left">This is cured beef, and it is unique to Castilla y León. The hind legs are cured for 14 months, then lightly smoked, and the result is somewhere between a ham and Italian cured beef, <em>bresaola</em>. <em>Cecina</em> is served sliced, and I have seen it presented with shavings of <em>foie gras</em> over the top, but my favourite way is sprinkled with pomegranate seeds. It is also good in salads, or, for a quick and tasty tapa, wrap strips of <em>cecina</em> around jarred <em>higos agridulce</em>: ‘bittersweet’ figs preserved in mustard syrup.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">Salchichón</h4>
<p class="flush_left">This is dry-cured pork sausage, which is the equivalent of the French <em>saucisson</em> or the Italian <em>salami</em>. Not surprisingly, it is most typical of Catalunya (where it is called <em>llonganissa</em>) which borders France and is across the water from Italy, areas of which it once ruled. While this style of sausage is made all around Spain, it is really only worth seeking out in Catalunya and south-west Spain (where it is made with meat from the Ibérico pig), as elsewhere it is often a very standard industrial <em>salami</em> made from indifferent meats and offal. In these two regions, however, <em>salchichón</em> can be superb, designed to highlight the meat, so that the spicing, which might be black or white pepper, nutmeg, coriander, oregano and/or garlic, is used to enhance, rather than dominate, the flavour of the pork. In Catalunya <em>salchichón (llonganissa)de Vic</em>, from the city of the same name, is a guarantee of quality.</p>
<p class="indented">Variations on <em>salchichón</em>-style sausages range from the thinner <em>Ib</em>é<em>rico</em> <em>longaniza</em> (the Castilian spelling) to the Catalan <em>llonganissa de payés</em>, the very thin <em>fuet</em> (which can be hoop-shaped or candle-shaped), <em>secallona</em>, <em>tastet</em>, <em>espetec</em> or <em>sumaya</em>, but all of these are extremely rare outside Catalunya.</p>
<h4 class="c_head"><a id="pg_179"/>Ibérico salchichón</h4>
<p class="flush_left">The very best <em>salchichón</em> from the south-west will have been made from the acorn-fed <em>de bellota</em> pigs that have roamed outside for most of their lives, so the meat will be infiltrated with acorn-rich fat and the sausage is so good that I often prefer it to <em>chorizo</em>. It is even more irresistible in the season immediately following the winter slaughter, when it is known as <em>salchichón vela</em>. This is thinner – about 3cm in diameter as opposed to 6cm for regular <em>salchichón</em>, and is cured for a shorter time, only a matter of weeks, so it is quite fresh-tasting, juicy, melting and velvety, with an aroma of the acorns and forest foods on which the pig will have fed.</p>
<h2 class="box-head" id="box7"><a id="pg_180"/>Four Storeys of Sausages</h2>
<p class="flush_left">The city of Vic sits on a high plateau surrounded by table mountains in the foothills of the Pyrenees, and when you drive towards it, invariably you go from bright sunshine into a thick mattress of cotton wool mist, known locally as <em>la boira.</em> It is this misty moistness, where cold crisp mountain air meets warm humid lowland air, that creates a unique microclimate in which the high natural bacterial activity is perfect for the curing of <em>salchichón.</em> As a result they develop a special aroma and flavour that makes them as desirable as any sausages made from the highly prized <em>Ibérico</em> pork at the other end of the country.</p>
<p class="indented">The <em>salchichón</em> we buy for Brindisa is made by the Riera family in a beautiful old town house with wrought-iron balconies, decorated with frescoes and a sundial, overlooking a square in the centre of Vic. Joaquim Comella Riera, who now runs the business, is the sixth generation of the family, who have been making and curing their salami-like sausages to the same recipe at Casa Riera Ordeix since 1852.</p>
<p class="indented">From the outside you would have no idea that, apart from the old living quarters that have been preserved from the days when it was also the family home, the four storeys are given over completely to the natural curing of sausages. The floors have loosely fitted boards over wooden beams, so that when the master curer adjusts the humidity and air flow by opening or closing the louvred windows, the air can circulate freely through the four levels. Even the wood itself, with its capacity to absorb moisture in this damp climate, is an essential element of humidity control.</p>
<p class="indented">Once I had returned to London in 1986 and was setting up Brindisa, my brother and any other relatives or friends who happened to be coming to the UK would always be instructed to stop in at Vic first to collect a box of the sausages for us from Joaquim’s father, who was then in charge. We couldn’t sell them until 1992, when Spain finally opened its doors to exports. Then, when the EU began to impose new standards on producers, we were all concerned that the town house would have to change. However, thanks to a mixture of determination and good sense, this hasn’t happened, and these glorious sausages are still allowed to be made in the time-honoured way.</p>
<p class="indented"><a id="pg_181"/>The family’s small team of skilled butchers prepare the best pork leg or loin (depending on the recipe), together with belly. To make a genuine <em>salchichón de Vic</em>, you only use meat from sows of 2½ to 3½ years old, who will have had six litters by then. This more mature meat ensures a more active and dark cure, so there is no need to add any sugars or colouring to the recipe.</p>
<p class="indented">From Monday to Thursday the fresh meat is chopped by hand and the fat removed, and on Friday the mincing is done by machine. Some of it will be done more finely to make <em>salchichón de payés,</em> the ‘country’ sausage, which at Brindisa we simply call <em>llonganissa</em> in order to distinguish it from the <em>salchichón de Vic.</em> Once minced, ground black pepper, whole peppercorns and cubed belly fat are added and the mixture is left to settle and marinate over the weekend in the fridge. On the following Monday and Tuesday the natural tripe skins are filled to form sausages in various styles, including the stick-like <em>bastonet</em> (named after the wooden stick that is used in the traditional dance of the <em>bastonets</em> – a kind of Catalan equivalent of Morris dancing). In season, the family also make a special sausage in which the minced pork is mixed with black winter truffles.</p>
<p class="indented">Next, the sausages are taken up to the curing rooms to hang. This is very much an instinctive affair that relies on handed-down knowledge. Joaquim tells me that he often wanders through the rooms during the quiet of the night, checking on his <em>salchichones</em> and soaking up the feeling of history that pervades the old family house. In summer the sausages are hung higher in the house where there is more ventilation, while in winter they have to be moved around according to the damp. The curing time can be anything from two to six months, as again, so many factors come into play, from the size of the sausage to the thickness of the tripe casing, the positioning of the sausage in the hanging rooms and the climate outside.</p>
<p class="indented">My absolute favourite of their sausages is the <em>salchichón de Vic</em>, but any one of the range is fantastic with tomato bread, as one of a selection of small plates before a main meal, for tapas, or even for breakfast.</p>
<p class="recipe-head2" id="reca6"><a id="pg_182"/>ENSALADAS</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead1">Salads</p>
<p class="flush_left">There was a time when ordering <em>ensalada mixta</em> (mixed salad) in a Spanish restaurant could be a minefield. You might easily receive a plate piled high with everything from tuna <em>escabeche</em>, olives and tinned white asparagus to tinned corn, diced beetroot, carrot, the inevitable chunks of hard-boiled egg and slices of raw onion. Even in the best restaurants a salad would often be considered a showcase for speciality regional food, so in Catalunya <em>ensalada catalana</em> would inevitably be full of hearty slices of cured and poached meats and sausage, and in Alicante <em>ensalada</em> <em>de la tierra</em> would be loaded with <em>salazones</em> (cured fish, <em>mojama</em> and roe, see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_118">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">In recent years, though, much has changed, and I have eaten many fine, restrained salads around Spain, particularly in Catalunya, that feature local produce such as citrus fruits, salt cod, anchovies, capers and beans in a more delicate way. Such salads combine well with other small plates, and I have included some of my favourites here.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">A note on oil</h4>
<p class="flush_left">For salads that feature salty or sharp ingredients, such as salt cod or citrus fruits, I would recommend a peppery oil such as Núñez de Prado or Olivar de la Luna. Where cheese or fresh seafood are involved, or for green salads, I would go for a sweeter oil such as an Arbequina. Both styles of oil work well for salads involving grilled fish or poultry.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec65">Ensalada de queso de cabra ‘Luna Negra’ con frutos secos</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Goat’s cheese, dried fruit and nut salad</p>
<p class="flush_left">Luna Negra is a lactic, ash-coated, round soft goat’s cheese, which we really wanted to introduce and show off at its best in the tapas bars and restaurants, so our executive chef, Josep, created this utterly delicious salad. You could, however, use another Spanish cheese such as Monte Enebro from Ávila, or substitute an English goat’s cheese log, such as Golden Cross.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">6 tablespoons sweet olive oil, such as Aubocassa</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 small clove of garlic, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon pine nuts</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon almonds</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon hazelnuts</p>
<p class="ingredients">25g raisins</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 tablespoons PX vinegar (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_188">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">250g baby mixed leaves</p>
<p class="ingredients">5 cherry tomatoes, finely sliced</p>
<p class="ingredients">150g soft goat’s cheese, such as Luna Negra (see <a href="chapter_003.html#rec65">here</a>), cut into small squares</p>
<p class="method">To make the dressing, heat the oil very gently in a pan over a low heat and add the garlic and all the nuts. This oil will become part of the dressing, so be careful not to let it get overheated or burn, or it will turn bitter. When the nuts are light golden, lift them out and keep to one side.</p>
<p class="method">Put the raisins into the pan of oil and shake them around so that they are all coated. Heat gently for about 3 minutes, by which time the raisins will have swollen with the oil, then pour in the vinegar and let the mixture bubble and reduce for about 4 minutes, until it caramelises. Take off the heat and allow to cool.</p>
<p class="method">Arrange the leaves and tomatoes on a serving plate with the squares of cheese and the toasted nuts on top. Drizzle with the dressing.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec66"><a id="pg_183"/>Cogollos con anchoa y tomate</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Fergus Henderson’s anchovy, Little Gem and tomato salad</p>
<p class="flush_left">Fergus Henderson of St John Restaurant is one of our longest-standing customers and supporters from way back in the days when I was operating solo; so when we celebrated Brindisa’s twentieth anniversary it seemed only fitting that we celebrate with Fergus, his wife, Margot, and all the St John crew in their inimitable style in an arch in Shoreditch, amid tables heaving with food that they had prepared, and dancing to the music of Roberto Pla and his twelve-piece Colombian band!</p>
<p class="indented">Fergus included this salad in his first book, <em>Nose to Tail Eating,</em> and it is similar to a popular starter salad in Catalunya which shows off fine <em>anchoas de L’Escala</em> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#rec39">here</a>), filleted at the last minute so they retain all their deep-sea-and-salt flavour, which contrasts with the light freshness of the young green lettuce halves, or ‘<em>cogollos</em>’, on which they are served. Fergus includes tomatoes and parsley, which the Spanish would not add, but in my view they bring colour and juice to something that might appear a little plain for the UK taste. And I love the way, in his book, he asks you to use the happiest tomatoes you can find – i.e. those that have seen the sun.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">6 good sweet tomatoes on the vine</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">a handful of chopped parsley</p>
<p class="ingredients">16 good anchovy fillets in oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">2 heads of Little Gem lettuce, washed and separated into leaves</p>
<p class="forhead">For the dressing</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 clove of garlic, finely crushed</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</p>
<p class="ingredients">a pinch of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">juice of ½ a lemon</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="ingredients">150ml sweet extra virgin olive oil, such as Aubocassa or L’Estornell</p>
<p class="method">Preheat the oven to 180ºC/gas 4.</p>
<p class="method">Slice the tomatoes in half lengthways, sprinkle with salt, pepper and olive oil and roast in the preheated oven for about 20 minutes to soften and slightly dry them, intensifying and sweetening their flavour. Allow to cool, then mix with the rest of the ingredients in a serving dish.</p>
<p class="method">Combine all the ingredients for the dressing, except the oil, then slowly mix this in until the dressing emulsifies. Toss through the salad. You may not need all the dressing, but what you don’t need you can keep in the fridge for about 5 days.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec67"><a id="pg_184"/>Salpicón de rape y gambas</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Seafood salad of monkfish and prawns</p>
<p class="flush_left">A few years ago I took a group of erudite cheese experts and food writers on a trip through the high villages of the Picos de Europa mountains, hunting for local cheeses with the help of a valued colleague, María Cobo. Before we flew home, we stopped off at Somo, an unremarkable-looking coastal town facing Santander, but with a stunning beach. We stayed in a gorgeous rural house called La Casona de Suesa, and the owners recommended a restaurant called El Galeón de Somo. When we arrived for dinner we found our table was next to the kitchen counter, where we could see the chef proprietor, Agustín Bedía, preparing the fish for service – enormous turbots, vivacious lobsters and the spooky-looking <em>percebes</em> (barnacles, see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_112">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">Agustín is an imposing character, with a big smile and a head brimming with facts about the local fish and seafood he serves. He comes from Astorga, in the deepest hills of the province of León, in northern Spain, which is probably the country’s biggest meat-eating region, a land of beans and pork, so it is interesting that he is a fanatical expert on the fruits of the sea and all its complexities. We were so overwhelmed by his food that our party returned for lunch the next day, and now whenever we take a family holiday in the region we always make time to stop for a meal at El Galeón de Somo before flying home. Since the restaurant is so close to the airport, it is the perfect way to round off a trip.</p>
<p class="indented">We especially love this <em>salpicón</em>, as it is a dish that can so often be ordinary, and Agustín generously gave me the recipe. His trick with the monkfish and prawns is to cook them separately and fast for just 2 minutes in a very large amount of water – he suggests 1 litre per 100g of fish (however, this isn’t always practical in a domestic kitchen, so just fill the biggest pan you have) – before lifting them out and putting them into iced water to keep the texture good and firm.</p>
<p class="indented">Agustín prefers to use a mild vinegar and oil which won’t overwhelm the flavour of the seafood, so I suggest a very delicate, sweet PX vinegar <em>en rama</em> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_188">here</a>), and an olive oil such as Arbequina.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">3 eggs</p>
<p class="ingredients">400g monkfish, cut into pieces about 2cm square</p>
<p class="ingredients">400g king prawns, peeled</p>
<p class="ingredients">around ½ a green pepper, or to taste, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">around ½ a red pepper, or to taste, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">around ½ a shallot, or to taste, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingredients">150ml sweet extra virgin olive oil, such as Brindisa Arbequina</p>
<p class="ingredients">50ml good-quality sherry vinegar PX <strong><em>en rama</em></strong> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_188">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt</p>
<p class="method">Boil the eggs for 10 minutes until hard, then cool under running water and peel. Leave to cool, then cut into thin slices lengthways.</p>
<p class="method">Bring some water to the boil in the largest pan you can find and have ready a bowl of iced water. Add the monkfish and boil for 2 minutes, then lift out with a slotted spoon and put into the iced water. Put the prawns into the same boiling water, also for 2 minutes, then lift out and add to the bowl of iced water.</p>
<p class="method">Arrange the fish, prawns and slices of egg on the plate and mound the chopped peppers and shallot in the centre.</p>
<p class="method">Combine the oil and vinegar and season with salt. Drizzle over the dish and put into the fridge to rest for an hour before serving, as the salad is at its best when chilled.</p>

<p class="square-subhead">‘crafted with immence care, pattience and respect’</p>
<p class="flush_left">Where there is alcohol there will eventually be vinegar, and Spain has an ever-growing array of stunning examples made from both sherry and wine. Back in 1991 we sold our first sherry vinegar to chefs, produced by the family-run Valdespino <em>bodega</em>. It was complex, balanced and special, and it had a massive impact on restaurant kitchens. Since then more and more wine co-operatives and estates have begun developing excellent vinegars, often from single grape varietals, and the most outstanding ones are crafted with immense care, patience and respect. Some of the most stunning I have tasted are the Casta Diva vinegars made by Pilar Sapena on the wine estate of Bodegas Gutiérrez de la Vega (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_190">here</a>).</p>
<p class="indented">Traditionally, in Spain families would often make their own vinegar from leftover wine, which would be used both to enhance flavours and extend the life of fresh foods such as fish, vegetables and meats, especially game. In contemporary cooking, however, the more sophisticated vinegars that are now readily available are used with fresh fruit, in sauces, or rice dishes; while a generous drop in a soup or a dish of beans and lentils can bring flavours together and add an extra dimension in a way that few other ingredients can.</p>
<p class="recipe-head" id="rec68">Vinagre de Jérez</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Sherry vinegar</p>
<p class="flush_left">The vinegars produced by the sherry estates of Spain have become much better known and understood over the last two decades. They must be made within the ‘sherry triangle’ of the towns of Sanlúcar de Barrameda, Jérez de la Frontera and El Puerto de Santa María and are matured using the <em>solera</em> method, which involves mixing older and newer vinegars in partly-filled wooden barrels and allowing them to mature and evaporate for at least 6 months, after which time the vinegar becomes dark, with aromas of liquorice, salty almonds and yeast. When aged for 2 years the vinegar can be labelled <em>reserva</em> and after 10 years <em>gran reserva</em>. The longer it is matured the more dense, dark and smooth-flavoured it will become.</p>
<p class="indented">The particular character of the vinegar depends on the grape varietal. Typical of the good, traditional sherry vinegars is the dark, intense and deeply aromatic cask-aged Gran Reserva from Valdespino, made from wine of the Palomino grape, which is most commonly used to make the dry, straw-coloured <em>fino</em> and <em>manzanilla</em> sherries.</p>
<div class="full-image"><a id="pg_187"/><img alt="image" class="full-height" src="../images/pg187.jpg"/></div>
<h4 class="c_head"><a id="pg_188"/>Vinagre de Pedro Ximénez (PX)</h4>
<p class="flush_left">The origin of this vinegar is the subject of great debate, but the popular story is that when King Carlos I (who was also Charles V of Germany and Holy Roman Emperor) arrived in Spain he was accompanied by an army recruited from peasants from the banks of the Rhine, and among them was a wine-maker called Peter Siemens, who brought with him grape varietals unknown in the Iberian peninsula. The vines were planted around the sherry towns and evolved into the white varietal known as PX. Once harvested the grapes are dried in the sun so they become raisin-like and will produce a rich, sherry vinegar.</p>
<p class="method">There are many fine examples, but at Brindisa we support two which we believe to be the most remarkable. Both are offered by producers of quite special olive oil, who are able to apply their skill and understanding to the selection of superb vinegars.</p>
<p class="method"><em>Sotaroni</em> is a delicious balsamic PX vinegar from the south of Spain, aged for 12 years and selected by the Torrevella estate, which produces excellent olive oils in Valencia. It has a sweet and sour quality, with flavours and aromas reminiscent of dried fruit and nuts.</p>
<p class="method">Ximénez Paula Coll de Acetum Flumen <em>en rama</em> is selected and finished by Martí Terés i Ríos, owner of the Catalan olive oil producers Oleum Flumen. Since 1983 the vinegar has been made on the family-run Ximénez Spinola estate in Jérez de la Frontera, where Martí shares barrels and cellars with the Spinola family and produces and monitors limited editions (only around 1,500 half bottles a year) of his stunning vinegar.</p>
<p class="method"><em>En rama</em> refers to grapes that are ripened on the vine and once harvested are matured and dried further in the sun, so they will have intensified in flavour and have a low water content. A hundred kilos of these sun-dried grapes, known as ‘<em>pasificadas al sol’,</em> will be reduced to 30 litres of must, which is aged for up to 25 years through a series of oak barrels to make the PX sherry wines that then feed the vinegar barrels. The oak lends a little woody smokiness to the rounded, sweet and mellow flavours of the vinegar, with its good balance of sharpness and roasted aromas.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">How to choose vinegar</h4>
<p class="flush_left">As with wine or olive oil, so much is down to individual preference and the context in which you want to use a vinegar.</p>
<p class="method">The best way to taste vinegar is in a wine glass, but leave it for a minute after pouring, as the aroma can seriously tickle the nasal passages. A good vinegar should be smooth and dense, with a careful balance of acidity and sugar.</p>
<p class="method">When buying wine vinegars look for ones made with slow cold methods of acetification, which allow them to retain most of the qualities of the original grape variety. The most famous of these is the Schützenbach ‘trickling’ method, which was developed by a German chemist in 1823.</p>
<p class="method">In many of the recipes in this book and in dressings, especially for warm salads, I recommend Moscatel vinegar, as it is balanced with a mellow, bitter-sweet flavour of fresh apples, pears and jasmine flowers, which will add character to a dish without any harshness. Sprinkle it on fruit salads and even chocolate puddings. Two teaspoons of Moscatel vinegar with a heaped tablespoon of orange blossom honey (or other light floral honey) and a pinch of sea salt in a mug of boiling water is also a fabulous remedy for sore throats, which our former Brindisa colleague Scott Boden would unfailingly produce for anyone ailing, with instructions to stir well, relax the mouth and throat and sip slowly.</p>
<p class="method">A good Cabernet Sauvignon vinegar made using the Schützenbach method should be elegant and dense, with aromas of plums and red peppers – <a id="pg_189"/>perfect for sprinkling over <em>escabeche</em> dishes and using in marinades and reductions for sauces, especially to go with steaks and other red meats.</p>
<p class="method">Merlot vinegar aged for 12 months in oak is bittersweet and smooth, with notes of red berries and spice. It pairs well with fresh tomatoes, or add some to apple sauce for serving with roasted meats.</p>
<p class="method">Good vinegars made with the fruity Chardonnay grape according to the Schützenbach method will be crisp and flowery with some sweet almond notes; ideal for fish and salads.</p>
<p class="method">Riesling vinegars aged for 2 months are refreshing, with hints of exotic fruits and citrus – good with fruit salads and duck dishes.</p>
<p class="method"><em>Vermut</em> vinegar is as complex as the drink of vermouth itself, and with its herbal undertones it suits marinades for olives and <em>boquerones</em> (see <a href="chapter_003.html#rec41">here</a>).</p>
<p class="method">Balsamic apple vinegars from northern Spanish regions such as Lerida, Asturias and the Basque country are sharp yet honeyed, and have a sweet and sour tone that pairs well with sautéd leaves such as spinach, chard or red cabbage, fruity salads and puddings.</p>
<p class="method">Sherry vinegar is good for meat marinades and in <em>gazpacho</em> soups.</p>
<p class="method">The more dense, dark and aged vinegars, such as PX sherry vinegar and Casta Diva Fondillon wine vinegar, are excellent with cheese, sprinkled over fried eggs, a bowl of steamed clams or mussels, or roasted potatoes, red meat and pâté; and also pair well with ice cream and soft fruits, such as strawberries and cherries. Cut the fruit in half and sprinkle with sugar first, leave them for 2 minutes or so, then sprinkle them with the vinegar. Leave them for another 10 minutes, then drizzle with some good olive oil, such as Arbequina, just before serving.</p>
<h2 class="box-head" id="box8"><a id="pg_190"/>Life and Cooking with Pilar and Felipe</h2>
<p class="flush_left">On a winter evening in a bar in San Sebastián, back in 2006, our friend and supplier of wonderful conserved fish from the Rías Gallegas in Galicia, Ángel Delgado, introduced me to a small group of seminal people: Imanol Jaca, who has provided us with his exceptional beef ever since (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_438">here</a>); María José San Román, restaurateur and ‘Saffron Queen’ (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_101">here</a>); and Felipe Gutiérrez de la Vega and his wife Pilar Sapena of Gutiérrez de la Vega wines in the village of Parxent near Javea in La Marina Alta. We all settled in for a session of fine <em>pintxos</em> (tapas) and the evening went on and on into the night, as we were having so much fun.</p>
<p class="indented">The willowy Pilar and arts lover Felipe make a striking couple. Felipe produces exceptional red, white and dessert wines, and is recognised as the first wine-maker in Spain to make dry, as well as sweet white wine from the famous local Moscatel grape, with his Casta Diva Cosecha Dorada. And Pilar produces a golden early harvest extra virgin olive oil, as well as a late harvest one, which is such a deep mossy green that it reminds me of a Tuscan oil. Both are simply stone-pressed and bottled (for more on the oils see <a href="chapter_003a.html#p216a">here</a>). She also makes luxurious wine vinegars in tiny batches (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_186">here</a>) and wine <em>gelées</em> (jellies) which are lovely with cheese, cold meats and pâtés, or can be coated in sugars and eaten as sweets. After I first met the couple Felipe would send me his wines regularly to taste, and in one consignment he included some of Pilar’s vinegars – it only took one drop for me to know that I had to visit Parxent to see how she created such jewels and, if possible, bring some back to Brindisa.</p>
<p class="indented">Felipe’s father was Basque and his mother from Sevilla, and he was brought up in Madrid, steeped in the city’s art, music and politics, so he has dedicated each of his wines to a great artist, writer or musician. Soprano Montserrat Caballé and novelist Camilo José Cela feature on the labels of the sublime Casta Diva Cosecha Miel, James Joyce on Viña Ulises, and Italian writer Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, author of <em>The Leopard</em>, is quoted on the label of the red Príncipe de Salinas, made from the Monastrell grape.</p>
<p class="indented">La Marina Alta is a very small, unusual and special <em>comarca</em> (district) of Alicante, which has the same average rainfall as Bordeaux, but more sunshine to dry off the grapes and vines, so there is little risk of rotting. Close to the Levante coast, Spain’s <a id="pg_191"/>most mountainous coastal area overlooking the Mediterranean, it has a humid, fresh, breezy and sunny microclimate. This, combined with the growing of local grape varietals on old vines in sandy, chalky soil, makes it possible to produce the range of Casta Diva wines, with their unique balance of natural sweetness and <em>la fescura</em> (freshness), as well as the dry Cosecha Dorada.</p>
<p class="indented">When Felipe and Pilar first returned to the area to settle, after living and marrying in the Canary Islands, they would join with her family in making a barrel of wine a year. Gradually, though, with the help of Tío Raimundo, Pilar’s uncle and viticulture expert, Felipe learned about the land, the vines and the wine-making process, so they took over a small <em>bodega</em> that had been used for pressing olive oil in nearby Parxent, and set about extending the wine production. Felipe concentrated on the white Moscatel de Alejandria grape, which is synonymous with La Marina Alta, and the meaty, robust local Monastrell grape, though he also grows Giró (a varietal of Garnacha, or Grenache<em>)</em> and has a small plot of Shiraz.</p>
<p class="indented">The Moors, who followed the Romans in the region, built an ingenious system of irrigated terraces known as <em>bancales</em>, stretching from the dominating Montgó mountain to the beach. Sadly most of these, along with the old family <em>huertas</em> (allotments) and patches of mountain farmland, have been bought by developers, but Felipe is determined to pursue his wine-making in the traditional spirit of the <em>huerta</em> by taking on the care of old vines on the remaining small parcels of terraced groves.</p>
<p class="indented">These days the wine-making has moved to a bigger site in the village, while the old <em>bodega</em> is used for Pilar’s vinegar-and oil-making. Pilar is a wonderful cook who was brought up in Javea, where her family made a living growing, selling and exporting the famous Moscatel raisins of the area, as well as harvesting olives and grapes, and making oil, wines and vinegars for their own consumption. She learned to cook from her grandmother, who mostly brought her up while her mother was at work, and who also taught her the skills of the <em>huerta</em>. Every school summer holiday from the age of eight, she would watch and help her grandmother grow vegetables and herbs and prepare the family meals. Nowadays she makes wonderfully healthy dishes for visitors to the <em>bodega</em> and bakes her own bread, as well as producing her vinegars and oils, and when I began writing this book, to which she has generously contributed many recipes, I spent some time cooking with her.</p>
<p class="indented">Our first stop was the beautiful stone-built covered market that had been designed by her family. As always, even after so many years of living in Spain, I found myself initially having to shake off the very English need to plan before buying food and give myself up to Pilar’s very Spanish attitude of buying <em>sobre la marcha</em> – on the hoof, going for what looks good and then working out what to do with it later.</p>
<p class="indented">Pilar thinks nothing of beginning the day’s cooking and baking at 5 a.m., to a background of whatever operas or symphonies Felipe <a id="pg_192"/>has selected for the day, played through the sound system that delivers music throughout their work spaces. In the beamed kitchen there is a wood-burning oven set in the wall, where she bakes her <em>coques,</em> both breads and cakes (see <a href="chapter_002.html#pg_70">here</a>), sweet bread rolls and <em>empanadillas</em> (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#pg_250">here</a>). There is also an area for cooking over wood and vine trimmings, where special holders allow a big paella pan and the traditional, tall, four-legged, long-handled pan for making <em>gazpachos manchegos</em> (see <a href="chapter_004a.html#pg_456">here</a>) to sit comfortably at the correct height over the flames.</p>
<p class="indented">The flavours in Pilar’s food are exquisite but always subtle, and what elevates her simple-sounding dishes beyond excellent home cooking are the special touches. Her bread doughs will have a dash of Moscatel wine in them; she insists on manually grinding almonds with their skins on to give her almond tarts just the right texture; she will toss onions in salt and leave them for 30 minutes, then rinse, drain and dry them to soften the taste before adding them to a salad (these drained onions are known as <em>sevas escorregudas</em> in Valencian), or go out with a pair of scissors looking for particular wild herbs. She will squeeze orange juice into a dressing only when the fruit is from the early crop, because the flavour of their juice has just the right sharpness. In August she will harvest <em>ñora</em> peppers from the <em>huerta</em>, then lay them out in the full sun to dry on <em>cañizos</em> (cane mats) covered with netting at night to protect them from insects. This slow drying produces a fresh flavour and bright red colour totally unlike commercially dried peppers.</p>
<p class="indented">Each day we would cook until 2 p.m., when Pilar would put out the foods we had made for lunch, and Felipe and the couple’s daughter, Violeta, now a qualified oenologist herself, would join us. A different bottle of wine would be opened each day: sometimes the red Príncipe de Salinas, minerally and dry, reflecting the sandy soil in which the vines grow; the Recóndita Armonía, a sweet berry-rich red that tastes like ripe Victoria plums; or the semi-sweet, ruby red Fondillon, the traditional wine of Alicante made from a combination of fully ripened and overripe Monastrell grapes and aged in barrels for 10 years or longer, which I think is amazing with chocolate desserts.</p>
<p class="indented">Pilar told me that she insists on a daily glass of Fondillon for good health, as her grandmother and mother used to give her a glass of it every day with bread and sugar when she was a child, and she believes the combination to be the perfect match and medicine.</p>
<p class="center_head">THE CASTA DIVA VINEGARS</p>
<p class="flush_left">Pilar’s wonderful vinegars are an extension of Felipe’s ability to craft some of Spain’s very best wines. She makes three kinds, a Moscatel vinegar, a balsamic vinegar from the must of the Moscatel grapes, and balsamic vinegar, which is made from the must of the Monastrell grapes.</p>
<p class="indented">The Moscatel vinegar is made using the slow, continuous <a id="pg_193"/>Orléans method, originated by Louis Pasteur in the nineteenth century. To start the process off, the Moscatel wine is aged for 6 years in aerated barrels to which a special <em>madre</em> or ‘mother’ bacteria that is viscous in texture is added, which ‘feeds’ the wine and turns it to vinegar. This mother grows inside the barrel and some of it is transferred to other barrels to start new batches. The vinegar barrels are monitored regularly and fresh wine is added to keep the acidity down and produce a delicate rusted-pink vinegar with a touch of sweetness and a taste of wine. When it is ready, the <em>madre</em> stays behind in the barrel and new wine is added, so the process can begin again.</p>
<p class="indented">The Moscatel balsamic vinegar is called <em>agrídulce</em> (sweet and sour) and is made from the second picking of very ripe grapes, the <em>sobremadura</em>. The bunches are hung for about 2 months from rafters in a shady, arched porch where the air can circulate and slowly dry them, so that they darken but don’t dry out or rot in the rain as they would if left on the vine. The grapes are then pressed manually to extract their juice, now highly viscous and honey-like, which is taken to the vinegar cellars in the old family <em>bodega</em>. Here Pilar cooks it down until reduced by half to create a rich must which is then aged for at least 10 years, starting in a large 125-litre barrel and then passing through a series of barrels of different woods – chestnut, cherry, acacia, juniper, oak and cedar. These decrease in size down to 10 litres and each adds its own tones and layers to the flavours and aromas. The cherry wood, for example, gives chocolate notes, while chestnut adds a degree of acidity.</p>
<p class="indented">Throughout the long and exacting process, Pilar monitors the aromas and flavours in order to move each batch of vinegar on at the right moment, then select and blend from the different barrels and finally bottle limited quantities, unfiltered, into small dark glass bottles.</p>
<p class="indented">The Fondillon balsamic vinegar is made using a similar process, but using the rich dark must from the Monastrell grapes. However, these are not hung after picking, and the barrel-ageing extends for up to 30 years, so that the resulting vinegar is dense, with spicy and sweet and sour overtones, reminiscent of dried figs and aromatic herbs.</p>
<p class="indented">From both these balsamic vinegars Pilar makes her special <em>gelées</em>, setting the vinegars with apple pectin. The Moscatel <em>gelée</em> is great with shellfish, fish, cheese and pâtés, while the Fondillon <em>gelée</em> is also perfect with pâtés, aged cheeses, certain salads, cured <em>salchichón</em> and red meats like roast lamb.</p>
<div class="diamond-image"><a id="pg_194"/><img alt="image" class="width50" src="../images/pg194.jpg"/></div>
<p class="square-subhead">‘ piquant, floral and citric’</p>
<p class="flush_left">There are about 345 varieties of caper bush in the world, which can either be cultivated or found wild throughout the western Mediterranean. Spain and Italy are the biggest cultivators in Europe, and both the buds (the capers) and the fruit (the bigger caperberries) are widely used in the Spanish kitchen, combined with anchovies, olives, tinned tuna or cured meats; in salads and sauces, and fish and rice dishes, to which they add piquancy, floral flavours and a citric vibrancy. However, their flavour can vary subtly according to factors such as the variety, the composition and the mineral content of the soil in which they are grown, and the degree of rainfall.</p>
<p class="indented">Both capers and caperberries are graded by size, whether cultivated or wild. The size affects texture, not flavour, and smaller ones are the most desirable, since these will be the firmest in the case of capers; while the smaller caperberries will be softer (though they should still have a little crunch when you bite them) and have less seeds than larger ones.</p>
<p class="indented">Both capers (<em>alcaparras</em>) and caperberries (<em>alcaparrones</em>) can be preserved in brine or vinegar. Capers can also be preserved in dry salt, which removes the sharpness and condenses and intensifies the flavour (it is rare to find Spanish caperberries packed this way). This is my preference as the capers retain their fresh flavour the best. Whichever way they are destined to be sold, they are all initially put into sea salt for two weeks to draw out the moisture and create a brine. Then they are rinsed and put into more sea salt for a further two weeks, before being drained, graded according to size and packed in salt, brine or vinegar.</p>
<h4 class="c_head">How to buy and use</h4>
<p class="flush_left">When buying capers in dry salt, check that the harvest date is shown on the packaging, and buy ones that are as close to this as possible, as they will be the freshest tasting.</p>
<p class="method">The salt should look good and white, rather than beginning to discolour around the capers.</p>
<p class="method">Capers in salt and capers and caperberries in brine need to be rinsed and soaked for 10 minutes, then drained before using, or they will add too much salt to your dish. Don’t soak them for longer, however, or you will leach the flavour from them.</p>
<p class="method">Capers and caperberries in vinegar only need rinsing and draining.</p>
<p class="method">They are best added raw, or, if added to hot dishes, this should be at the end, as too much heat will cause them to lose flavour.</p>

<h2 class="box-head" id="box9"><a id="pg_196"/>Miguel and the Wild Capers of Ballobar</h2>
<p class="flush_left">Up in the arid mountains above the village of Ballobar in Aragón grow some of the most distinctive wild capers and caperberries you will find in Spain. Although wild caper shrubs (<em>Caperis espinosa</em>) grow in arid areas of Lleida, the Balearics and Valencia, it is the Ballobar capers that grow in this, the biggest desert in Europe, that were once valued so highly they were said to have been given to the Russian Czar in exchange for caviar. Now they have become treasured again, so much so that they have been identified as a <em>baluarte</em> (Spanish Slow Food) product. And the man who chose to make a hero out of them is Miguel Ángel Salas.</p>
<p class="indented">Until a decade or so ago Miguel was a civil servant working on construction projects in the region, but when he saw the shrubs growing he decided to dedicate himself to harvesting and curing the buds. He set about learning the skill from the older ladies of the village and one of these venerable women, Señora Antonia, whose recipe he still uses, continues to taste each new harvest to give her opinion on the crop.</p>
<p class="indented">The first time I tasted the capers I was struck by their amazingly distinctive fresh, citrussy and earthy flavour. Even eaten straight from their jar of brine, their taste was so wonderful I was determined that at Brindisa we should help champion this very individual ingredient. So I decided to go over for the harvest in the Monegros Desert, where they are collected entirely by hand between June and August/September in temperatures that can rise to a scorching 50°C.</p>
<p class="indented">Although the bushes freeze in winter when the temperatures drop below 10°C, they recover and flourish in the heat of summer, and their roots can extend down 30 metres in search of water. Such extreme conditions create beautiful buds of grey-green with white and pinky flecks, and a characteristic, concentrated flavour and exceptional freshness, with no bitterness on the finish at all; and the berries that follow are more crunchy than other cultivated varieties. Such quality, however, comes at a price, since each bush produces only around 3 kilos of capers per plant, as opposed to 6–8 kilos for other varieties.</p>
<p class="indented">As Miguel drove me deep into the nether regions of Aragón towards Ballobar village there seemed something bleak but gripping about the scenery that reminded me of the open roads of <a id="pg_197"/>the southern states of America, where tumbleweed blows around, as we passed storks’ nests and the occasional itinerant hitch-hiking harvester looking for a lift to the next patch of work.</p>
<p class="indented">From the village we drove further up the barren, windswept mountain to the exposed areas where the shrubs were growing, seeming to love the hot dry wind that buffeted the thorny stems mercilessly as the pickers, who had been out harvesting since 6 a.m., tried to negotiate them without being prickled. Most of the varieties of caper found around the world are less thorny and much easier and cheaper to harvest than those from Ballobar, but there are none quite so amazing.</p>
<p class="indented">Many of the harvesters are Africans, who have built up a great reputation for the excellence of their work and travel through the region from one harvest to the next, saving up their money to send home to their families. In the heat, you can sustain only about 4 hours of back-breaking work, so by midday the pickers would begin bringing their shopping bags filled with capers into the sheds, where Miguel carried out a visual check, weighed and paid for each batch – then the capers were put through his homemade grader, which consisted of a series of rolling tubes with different sized holes which allowed the buds to be channelled into one of four different boxes, according to size. Leaves and bits of debris were removed, then Miguel sealed each grade separately in a plastic bag full of salt brine, ready for the transfer to the curing house in the town of Calanda, where the capers would be cured until October, before being packed into jars.</p>

<p class="recipe-subhead">Salt cod carpaccio and orange salad with capers</p>
<p class="flush_left">Wafer-thin ‘carpaccio’ slices of de-salted cod loin are the most elegant for this salad, but if you find the loin tricky to cut this finely, just use small pieces instead. In Spain people are lucky enough to be able to buy the carpaccio already coated in oil, so they don’t have to do the work themselves.</p>
<p class="indented">The capers can be in brine, or salt, whichever you prefer – if you can find wild ones (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_194">here</a>) these will be in brine.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">20g capers in brine or salt</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g salt cod (loin or fillet), de-salted (see <a href="chapter_004.html#p328a">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a large orange, or 1 small one</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a red onion or shallot, finely sliced</p>
<p class="ingredients">8 good black olives, such as Empeltre or Aragón</p>
<p class="ingredients">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">a pinch of fresh oregano</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon good olive oil, such as Arbequina</p>
<p class="method">Soak the capers in water for an hour, to remove the excess salt, changing the water twice, then drain them.</p>
<p class="method">Remove any small bones from the cod and either cut into small pieces, or with a very sharp knife cut into thin slices (about 1–2mm) crossways. Peel the orange and cut it into thin round slices.</p>
<p class="method">Lay the slices of cod on a plate, then lay the orange on top, followed by the onion or shallot, capers and olives. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper, sprinkle the oregano over the top and drizzle with olive oil.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec70">Xatonada</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Catalan salt cod and frisée salad</p>
<p class="flush_left">Another Catalan salt cod salad, which has a number of variations. Although it is traditionally done with salt cod, I have also seen it with tuna and/or anchovies, taking it closer to a Caesar salad, albeit with a nut sauce. This is our head chef Leo Rivera’s way of presenting it, which I particularly like, as he chops the spindly frisée (or escarole) lettuce quite finely, making it easy to eat, and dresses it with <em>xató</em> sauce and olives.</p>
<p class="indented"><em>Xató</em> is very similar to <em>romesco</em> sauce (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#p303a">here</a>), and there is much debate about how to distinguish the two, depending on the particular recipe you choose. The nuts in the sauce also tend to vary according to what is grown locally throughout the region, so in Tarragona it will usually be made with more, or only, hazelnuts, which grow in abundance there; while in Sitges the sauce will be made using more, or only, almonds. Leo uses half and half, but you can vary the proportion as you like.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">150g salt cod fillet, de-salted</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a frisée or escarole lettuce, chopped very finely</p>
<p class="ingredients">around 4 black olives, such as Empeltre, stoned and halved</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 x quantity <strong><em>xató</em></strong> sauce (see <a href="chapter_003a.html#p303a">here</a>)</p>
<p class="method">With a very sharp knife, remove the skin and then either slice the salt cod as thinly as you can or with your fingers break it up into bite-size pieces.</p>
<p class="method">Mound the frisée neatly on a serving plate and lay the salt cod slices or chunks over the top. Add the olives and dress with the sauce.</p>

<p class="recipe-head" id="rec71"><a id="pg_200"/>Esquiexada</p>
<p class="recipe-subhead">Catalan salt cod salad</p>
<p class="flush_left">This is a famous and very refreshing Catalan salad. <em>Esqueixar</em> means ‘to tear’, and you combine long, thin, torn strips of white salt cod with black olives and red and green peppers, which makes the dish quite dramatically colourful. It is also very light on the stomach.</p>
<p class="indented">If you don't have olive paste, you could stone and crush around 3 good black olives using a pestle and mortar.</p>
<p class="makes">Serves 4</p>
<p class="ingredients">200g salt cod (ideally loin, or <strong><em>morro</em></strong>), de-salted (see <a href="chapter_004.html#p328a">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a green pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a red pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients">6–8 cherry tomatoes</p>
<p class="ingredients">½ a shallot or sweet onion, finely sliced</p>
<p class="ingredients">about 12 good olives, preferably black, such as Empeltre or Aragón</p>
<p class="forhead">For the dressing</p>
<p class="ingredients">2½ tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 tablespoon good vinegar, such as Spinola PX sherry vinegar (see <a href="chapter_003.html#pg_188">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients">1 teaspoon <strong><em>olivada</em></strong> (Aragón olive pâté), thinned with a little extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="method">Remove the skin from the cod and carefully pick out any bones, then tear the flesh into long, thin strips.</p>
<p class="method">Slice the peppers into julienne strips and cut the tomatoes into quarters or sixths, depending on their size. Mix all the salad ingredients together loosely in a serving dish.</p>
<p class="method">Combine the oil and vinegar and dress the salad with it, then drizzle with the thinned olive pâté. Put in the fridge for an hour to marinate, and serve chilled.</p>
