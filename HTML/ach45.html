<p class="noindentb">The dry milk in this recipe produces a light, airy loaf and the walnuts release a rich aroma while the bread is baking. It is excellent served with assorted cheeses and a tossed salad, or dipped in a flavorful olive oil. Save some to toast in the morning, and top with marmalade or your favorite jam.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups warm water</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 package dry yeast</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">6 cups whole wheat flour, or more as needed</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 teaspoon kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">3</sub> cup whole milk powder</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 tablespoons honey</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup walnut oil</span></p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> In a small bowl, stir <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup of the warm water and the yeast. Set aside for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> In a large bowl, toss 3 cups of the flour, the salt, and the milk powder. Stir in the yeast mixture along with the remaining 2<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cups warm water, the honey, olive oil, and walnut oil. Mix with a fork or the dough hook of a stand mixer until well combined. Add the walnuts and 1 cup of the remaining flour to the mixture, kneading to combine.

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until the dough is soft and elastic, about 8 minutes. If the dough is very sticky, add more flour, <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup at a time, while kneading.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Place the dough in a clean bowl and cover with plastic wrap and a clean dish towel. Set aside in a warm place and allow to rise for 1 hour.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATIONS</span>:</span> This bread is also delicious when you replace the walnuts with an equal amount of coarsely chopped fennel leaves and 2 tablespoons fennel seeds or replace them with coarsely chopped sun-dried tomatoes or chopped pitted mixed olives. With either of these variations, regular olive oil may be used in place of the walnut oil. All versions of this bread freeze well.</p>
