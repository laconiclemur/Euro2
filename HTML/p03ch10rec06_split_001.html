<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">Rosa Tovar (see page 285) sent me this recipe, which is good for goat, venison, and wild boar, as well as for lamb, mutton, and pork. It was of both hunters and shepherds. It is originally from Alcarria in the province of Guadalajara, but there are versions of it found in small towns and villages in central Spain all the way down to Andalusia. Alcarria, an area of river valleys and mountains that abounds with flowers on which bees feed, produces a famous honey, and the best saffron is also from La Mancha. Start making this dish the day before.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE MARINADE</span></p>
<p class="qun">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">1 onion, cut in half</p>
<p class="qun">A head of garlic cloves, peeled</p>
<p class="qun">6 black peppercorns</p>
<p class="qun">3 cloves</p>
<p class="qun">1 cinnamon stick</p>
<p class="qun">A sprig of thyme</p>
<p class="qun">2 bay leaves</p>
<p class="qun">2 tablespoons honey</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup red or white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="qun1">1 cup dry white wine</p>
<p class="qun">1 large leg of lamb</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">1 tablespoon honey</p>
<p class="qun">2 tablespoons wine vinegar</p>
<p class="qun1">A good pinch of saffron threads</p>
<p class="recsum">For the marinade, put all the ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil, then simmer for 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool.</p>
<p class="summary">Trim the meat of excess fat and put it in a large plastic bag. Pour in the marinade, twist the bag so that it is closed tightly around the meat, and marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours, turning the bag a few times so as to soak the meat well all over.</p>
<p class="summary">Take out the meat, reserving the marinade, dry it with paper towels, and season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="summary">Heat the oil in a large casserole. Brown the meat on all sides over medium heat. Pour in the honey and let it brown a little, then stir in the vinegar and saffron.</p>
<p class="summary">Strain the marinade into the pot and bring to a boil, then simmer, covered, over low heat for 2½ hours, or until the meat is very tender; turn it every 20 minutes or so and add a little water if necessary—there should be a good amount of sauce left at the end.</p>
