<p class="normal"><b>Langues de chat are thin, crisp cookies that we normally serve at The Vineyard restaurant with afternoon tea or coffee. As I’m a lover of goat milk I wanted to see if I could make a version of the cookie with goat butter and goat crème fraîche, and here it is. These are delicious dipped into the sweet and slightly acidic confit tomato marmalade and goat milk yogurt dessert. Goat milk products are available online if you can’t source them locally.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 30 minutes, plus cooling</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 40 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 ounces vine cherry tomatoes, halved</p>
<p class="acktxt">¼ cup superfine sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 basil leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 pound plain goat milk yogurt</p>
<p class="acktxta">finely grated zest of 1 lime</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE LANGUES DE CHAT</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">7 tablespoons goat butter, soft, plus extra for greasing</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup superfine sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 egg whites</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 cup white bread flour, sifted, plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ vanilla bean, split in half lengthwise and seeds scraped out</p>
<p class="acktxt">6 tablespoons goat milk crème fraîche</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> To make the confit tomato marmalade, put the tomatoes, sugar, 1 basil leaf and the vinegar in a sauté pan with ¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons water and bring to a boil. Turn the heat down to low and simmer 20 to 30 minutes until the tomatoes thicken to the consistency of marmalade or a thick jam. Remove the pan from the heat and spoon the mixture into a bowl, cover and leave to cool. When it is cool, strain it through a fine strainer into a bowl to collect the juices (leave the tomatoe mixture to one side).</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Roughly chop the remaining basil leaf and add to the goat milk yogurt with the strained juices, then mix until just combined. Cover and leave in the refrigerator until ready to serve.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Heat the oven to 400°F. To make the <i>langues de chat</i>, beat together the butter and sugar, using an electric mixer, 5 minutes, or until light and well blended. Whisk in the egg whites, one at a time, because the mixture will split if you add them all at once, until incorporated. Gradually fold in the flour, then beat in the vanilla seeds and crème fraîche until the batter is soft, pale and creamy. Spoon the batter into a disposable pastry bag.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Grease and flour a large cookie sheet. Trim the end off the pastry bag to a ½-inch opening, then carefully pipe the cookies, 3 inches long, onto the cookie sheet, leaving a 4-inch gap between each one, because they spread during baking. Bake 5 to 6 minutes, turning the cookie sheet halfway through, until the cookies are dark golden brown around the edges and pale in the middle. Remove the cookie sheet from the oven, transfer the cookies to a wire rack and leave to cool and become crisp.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> To serve, spoon the confit tomatoes into the bottom of small sundae glasses, top with the yogurt and a sprinkling of lime zest and serve with the cookies.</p>
