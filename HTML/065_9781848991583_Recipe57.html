<h5 class="h5"><a id="pageid_90"/><b>Pickled Mackerel</b> <span class="smfont">with</span> <b>Warm Potato</b> <span class="smfont">and</span> <b>Radish Salad</b></h5>
<p class="normal"><b>This colorful salad reminds me of the time I spent in Sweden, as it is fairly typical of something you would eat for breakfast there. I was staying in the Grand Hotel, in Lund, and remember so well the breakfast table laden with smoked, marinated and pickled fish. It was amazing! My version features warm potatoes and cilantro with a yogurt-based French dressing. You can use some of the pickling liquid instead of the French dressing, if you like.</b></p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">SERVES</span></b> 4</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 20 minutes, plus 30 minutes cooling and 6 hours marinating</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 25 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 large pinches coriander seeds</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup white balsamic vinegar</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup Chardonnay vinegar or white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 tablespoons light soft brown sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 whole mackerel, about 9 ounces each, filleted</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon sea salt</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 small red onion, finely sliced</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 cilantro sprigs, plus 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 garlic clove</p>
<p class="acktxt">10 ounces small new potatoes, scrubbed</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 tablespoons French Dressing (see <a href="012_9781848991583_Recipe6.html">page 18</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons Mayonnaise (see <a href="011_9781848991583_Recipe5.html#pageid_18">page 18</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon plain Greek yogurt</p>
<p class="acktxt">finely grated zest and juice of 1 lime</p>
<p class="acktxt">8 large radishes, very thinly sliced</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 scallion, thinly sliced diagonally</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add the coriander seeds and lightly toast 1 minute, shaking the pan occasionally, until they color slightly and smell aromatic. Tip them onto a plate and lightly crush with the blade of a knife, then leave them to one side.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Pour both types of vinegar into a small saucepan. Add the sugar and put over medium heat to warm 2 to 3 minutes, or just long enough for the sugar to dissolve, stirring occasionally. Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the toasted coriander seeds and leave the liquid to cool.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Put the mackerel in a shallow, nonmetallic dish, skin-side down, and sprinkle with the sea salt. Pour the cool vinegar mixture over and top with three-quarters of the red onion. Cover with plastic wrap and leave the mackerel to marinate in the refrigerator about 6 hours, or until pickled, turning the fish over after 3 hours.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Just before the mackerel is ready, bring a saucepan of water, one-third full, to a simmer with a steamer insert on top. Put the remaining red onion, the cilantro sprigs and garlic in the water. Put the potatoes in the steamer, cover and steam 12 to 18 minutes until they are just tender. Turn the heat off and continue to steam the potatoes in the residual heat 5 minutes longer.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> While the potatoes are cooking, whisk together the French dressing, mayonnaise and Greek yogurt in a bowl, then stir in the lime juice and zest. Season with salt and pepper to taste. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut them into ¼-inch-thick slices and put them in a large serving bowl. Add the radishes and chopped cilantro, then drizzle the dressing over and toss gently without breaking up the potato slices. Scatter with the scallion. Lift the mackerel out of the pickling liquid and put on serving plates. Scatter some of the red onion over the top and serve with the potato salad.</p>
