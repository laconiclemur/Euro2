<p class="yield">MAKES ABOUT 2 CUPS/480 ML</p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote">Numerous Spanish dishes use this creamy white sauce. There are different levels of consistency, from runny to thick, though the recipes in this book call for a medium sauce. When using béchamel in a dish from this book, follow the quantities and ingredients given in that recipe.</p>
<ul>
<li>2 CUPS/480 ML MILK</li>
<li>2 TABLESPOONS BUTTER</li>
<li>2 TABLESPOONS FLOUR</li>
<li>PINCH SALT</li>
<li>PINCH FRESHLY GRATED NUTMEG</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt">In a saucepan, heat the milk over medium heat nearly to a boil; do not let it boil. Remove from the heat, cover the pan, and keep hot.</p>
<p class="method_txt">In a large, heavy saucepan over low heat, melt the butter. Sift in the flour and cook, whisking, as it bubbles and the flour loses its raw taste and takes on a lightly toasted color, about 1½&gt; minutes.</p>
<p class="method_txt">Over medium-low heat, gradually begin adding in the hot milk a ladleful at a time, incorporating each addition completely into the paste by whisking before adding more milk, 10 to 12 minutes total. It should be creamy and free of any lumps, and thickly coat the back of the spoon. Stir in the salt and nutmeg and remove from the heat.</p>
<p class="method_txt">Use immediately or store by letting it cool and refrigerate for 1 to 2 days with plastic wrap laid directly on the surface.</p>
