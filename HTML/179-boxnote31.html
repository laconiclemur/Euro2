<p class="running_first"><a id="page_256"/>The main embutidos that have been cooked (<em>cocidos</em>) as opposed to dry-cured include:</p>
<p class="running_first"><strong><em>butifarra blanca or butifarra cocida</em></strong> A white pork sausage seasoned with spices such as black pepper, nutmeg, and cinnamon, depending on the producer. In Catalunya, there is a similar version called <em>bull blanc</em>.</p>
<p class="running_first"><strong><em>butifarra negra</em></strong> Blood sausage made with offal and cooked with various spices, such as black pepper, nutmeg, and cinnamon. It tends to be denser and chewier than <em>morcilla</em> (see following). It is called <em>botifarra negre</em> in Catalunya, Valencia, and the Balearic Islands, where it is popular.</p>
<p class="running_first"><strong><em>jamón cocido</em></strong> The classic bright-pink cooked and deboned ham. It is also called <em>jamón dulce</em> (sweet ham), to distinguish it from the salty variety, or <em>jamón de York</em>, which refers to the English town where this style of preparing was popularized.</p>
<p class="running_first"><strong><em>morcilla</em></strong> Blood sausage made with minced pork. The stuffing can include rice, onions, pine nuts, and/or aniseed. Often cooked and served hot.</p>
<p class="running_first">And one important embutido that isn’t made from pork:</p>
<p class="running_first"><strong><em>cecina</em></strong> The hind leg of beef that has been salted, smoked, and then air-dried. Dark, lean, and carrying clear smoky, ancestral flavors, it is served very thinly sliced. The best is moist and tender. Superb with a drizzle of bold extra-virgin olive oil. A specialty of León.</p>
