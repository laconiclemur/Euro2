<p class="author1"><span class="txit">ditalini e piselli</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">As children, my sister Gina and I enjoyed this dish, but our younger sister, Christine, never could decide how she felt about it. One week she would eat all the peas and leave the pasta, another week she would eat all the pasta and leave the peas. Sorting the peas from the <span class="txit">ditalini,</span> which is a short tubular pasta (aka “little thimbles”), was a time-consuming task, but somehow Christine managed.</p>

Add the drained pasta to the sauce. Stir in enough of the reserved pasta water to create a slightly soupy sauce. Season with salt and pepper, and serve immediately. Garnish with Parmesan cheese if desired.</p>
