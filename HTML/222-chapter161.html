<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Two things are certain to be present at every village fiesta in Menorca: horses—magnificent stallions with braided manes and head finery parading among the crowds—and a lemony gin cocktail called <em>pomada</em>. One key ingredient is local, herbal-tasting gin</span> <a href="211-boxnote35.html#page_298"><span class="red">(see page 298)</span></a><span class="red">; another is lemons. Once made using only fresh lemon juice, it now generally includes a carbonated lemon beverage like Kas <em>limón</em>, too. (<a href="261-source.html#page_345"><span class="red">See Sources, page 345</span></a>, for where to find Kas lemon soda.)</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">     A friend named Cesc Segura introduced me to pomada in Menorca, and I still find his version of the drink to be the best. He combines the lemon juice, sugar, and gin in an empty water bottle, shakes to blend the ingredients, and then places it in the freezer. The Kas is added just before serving so that it retains its fizz. He uses equal proportions of gin, Kas, and fresh lemon juice, plus 1 tablespoon of sugar per lemon that he squeezed, but that depends on the tartness of the lemons. The drink should be sweetish, but still a touch tart, with the lovely aromas of juniper, pine, and the Mediterranean herbs of the gin coming through the lemon. Basically, you should be able to <em>taste</em> the gin, not just <em>feel</em> it.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 CUP/240 ML FRESH LEMON JUICE</li>
<li>SUGAR</li>
<li>1 CUP/240 ML MENORCA XORIGUER GIN OR ANOTHER GIN, PREFERABLY WINE-BASED</li>
<li>ICE CUBES</li>
<li>1 CUP/240 ML KAS OR FANTA LEMON SODA OR ANOTHER LEMON-FLAVORED CARBONATED DRINK</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> In a bowl, add the lemon juice and 1 tablespoon sugar per lemon used when juicing. Stir to dissolve. Taste and add more sugar if it is still extremely tart. (The lemon soda will sweeten the drink a touch more.) Pour into a glass jug or water bottle along with the gin. Place in the freezer until very cold.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> Fill four tall glasses with ice, pour in the lemon and gin mixture, and add the lemon soda. Serve very cold.</p>
