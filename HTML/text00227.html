 <span class="FMtitle_line">THANKS</span>
</h2>
<p class="first_paragraph" id="nad0002467">Abdal, thank you for being the best human being in the world! I hope God made you out of some sort of hardwearing thermosetting material, because there should be more of you in the world. You are the most supportive husband a girl could ever ask for. I love you more than marmite crisps!</p>
<p class="first_paragraph" id="nad0002468">My babies – Musa, Dawud and Maryam – day by day you become more intuitive, kinder and lovelier than I could hope for. Every day spent away from you is tough, but each day spent with you is worth its weight in saffron.</p>
<p class="first_paragraph" id="nad0002469">Amma and Baba, for all of your struggles and for all the times you tried to convince me there was method to your madness. I believe you now. I get it!</p>
<p class="first_paragraph" id="nad0002470">Dhidhi, Sadiafa, Pinks, Jak and Shak. It’s never about what we’ve done wrong, it’s all about who gets in trouble with Mum first! From our first taste of milk, to our fights over the hand-washing bowl and our triumphant milk-drinking challenges. It all started with you guys.</p>
<p class="first_paragraph" id="nad0002471">Thank you to my agent Anne for being at the end of the phone every single day, at any hour. You are relentless in making sure I am always smiling – and not just on my face, but on the inside too. I don’t know how you do it, but you do! It helps that you send me pictures of your shoes – that makes me happy in a way only you can truly understand.</p>
<p class="first_paragraph" id="nad0002472">To the television team! To the late nights, the long days and the many car trips. We got there in the end. Thank you to Paolo Proto, Stephen Leigh, Martha Delap, Laura Abrahams, Laia Niubo, Irina Aggrey, Becky Church, Nicole Larmour, Brendan Cornelissen, Pooch Horsburgh, Tom Kirkman and David Bimsom.</p>
<p class="first_paragraph" id="nad0002473">A special thank you to the man who knows my face better than anyone else. Danny Rohrer, you have the displeasure of looking at my face through a lens for hours on end! I would never have it any other way. I hope the sore shoulder was worth it for you. Thank you for tilting your head and reminding me that I can do it every time you see worry in my eyes. I can’t thank you enough for being there for me.</p>
<p class="first_paragraph" id="nad0002474">For all the legends who’ve worked tirelessly to get this book in ship-shape order. Huge thank you to John Hamilton, Ione Walder, Dan Bunyard, Sarah Fraser, Claire Bush, Gaby Young, Chris Terry, Emma Lahaye, Rob Allison, Danny, Rosie McKean, Katy Gilhooly, Beatrix McIntyre, Amy McWalters, Annie Lee, Deborah Hooper and Caroline Wilding.</p>
<p class="first_paragraph" id="nad0002475">Heather B, you are a superstar. For every time you had to straddle me in order to make me look and feel a million dollars, it was worth it! You are an artist like I have never met. Thank you for making me feel amazing.</p>
<p class="first_paragraph" id="nad0002476">Thank you to all the people I visited while making this book and TV series. Thanks for letting us take over your lives for a day. Meeting people like you made the experience of writing recipes and filming the series all the more wholesome. I learned a lot about myself along the way, and got to see my Britain in a whole new light. I also learned the hard way that my legs were made for land and not for sea!</p>
