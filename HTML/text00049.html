</h1>
<p class="pf">“You’re such a hot-shot home economist, tell me what makes good food.” Red faced, my new boss pointed at me, practically spitting the words.</p>
<p>As they say about death, my life flashed before me. That summer we had relocated back to Duluth, where Dick, with his newly acquired PhD from Stanford, had accepted a position at the University of Minnesota Duluth in the geology department. I had tearfully left the job of my dreams in California as a food writer for <i>Sunset</i>
 magazine, the journal of western living. I had started as a typist three years earlier and quickly climbed to the position of full-time staff writer. It was the job I had always wanted, and just as my pay was about to climb to the next level, we had to leave. It was 1964 and I hadn’t even considered the option of divorce.</p>
<p>Dick and I had packed our worldly belongings into the back of our tan 1956 VW Beetle, leaving just enough room for our two kids, six-year-old Cathy and four-year-old Greg, to lie flat on their stomachs on top of the pile as we drove and camped our way from California to Minnesota. Today, of course, such travel with kids would be illegal. We had shipped our books by mail, and we also had an ailing Ford Anglia, the British version of a small Ford car, that barely made it up the mountains. It was packed with our tent, sleeping bags, and food. We each drove one of our cars. I was thirty years old.</p>
<p>Before I left, a kindly editor at <i>Sunset</i>
 had suggested that in Duluth there was a company called Chun King that was owned by a man named Jeno Paulucci. I wrote the name into my date book and checked into Chun King, a very successful line of canned Chinese-like food products (chow mein and chop suey), as soon as we were settled in our new home. Not only did we need the money, but I also needed to fulfill my dreams. Thus began my search for something that was as fun as working for the magazine of western living.</p>
<p>I applied for a job at Chun King and was hired on the spot as a product developer in the research and development department. In the first hour of my job, I saw Jeno Paulucci himself, the president and owner of Chun King, subject a group of employees to an uncontrolled outburst. Shouting profanities, the red-faced big boss began throwing deep-fried chicken legs at the wall of the test kitchen while stunned food techs looked on.</p>
<p>When he spat his anger toward me, my inner calm took over even though I was surprised by the unexpected explosiveness of his demand that I tell him what made good food. I remember thinking that the answer was simple and I replied, “Well, first you have to start with good ingredients and a good idea, and then, not wreck the food with bad preparation techniques.” He had no answer to that.</p>
<p>The two dozen foil containers of reheated “Chinese” food that were laid out on the counter were entirely unknown to me, a brand-new employee. I was the only woman in the room and felt embarrassed for everyone who witnessed this tirade, and I thought that for sure Hot Head would regret his behavior once he settled down. I started to slip out of the kitchen as the vulgarities continued.</p>
<p>He noticed me leaving. I felt a hand grip my arm. “You’re going to get a bath in this along with everybody else!” he said, as he pulled me back into the room. I stood there, silent and a bit puzzled, as the attack went on.</p>
<p>The bizarre event I was seeing was called a “cutting”—a new term to me. It referred to the process of tasting and evaluating new product ideas. Jeno always had another entrepreneurial idea in mind. This time it was for a new chain of fast-food restaurants that was to be called the Chop Chop House. The plan was to serve Asian-style food quickly (<i>Chop chop!</i>
) to the public. The customer would place an order, and the food would be delivered in minutes, hot and ready for takeout. The techs in the kitchen had gone to work creating frozen foods that they thought would fit the theme.</p>
<p>So the foods on display that day had all been prepared, packaged, frozen, and reheated for evaluation—just as they would be before being served at one of the future restaurants. The selections included Middle America’s versions of sweet and sour pork and chicken, fried chicken legs, teriyaki beef, Chinese shrimp, stir-fried vegetables, fried rice, chop suey, and chow mein, among other unremarkable choices. The list read like the canned foods section in a supermarket at the time. I knew nothing about the idea until I was ordered into the cutting. Chop Chop House never made it from the concept stage to reality.</p>
<p>The “research lab” at Chun King was in reality nothing more than a huge, square kitchen with laminate countertops set along the walls and down the center of a rather dull and lifeless flat-white space illuminated by fluorescent lighting. There were occasional sinks and home-style, outdated kitchen ranges and a series of plug-ins on the walls. If everybody plugged a fry pan or deep fryer into the 110-volt outlets at the same time, the circuits blew. I felt out of place with the all-male staff in this ill-planned company kitchen.</p>
<p>The crew was friendly enough, but at coffee break, everybody—including women—lit up cigarettes and I could hardly breathe. I watched a sweet young secretary go from borrowing a puff from a friend’s Pall Mall to bumming cigarettes to smoking from her own pack.</p>
<p>After six months in the Chun King plant in the west end of Duluth, I proposed that I switch to a per project, hourly basis and instead work out of my home kitchen. They liked my idea and I transferred my product development duties to my own kitchen. It was such a relief.</p>
<p>Months later, when Jeno was making plans to sell his Chun King company to R. J. Reynolds, he knew he wanted to retain the rights to the highly successful egg roll technology that he had had developed. In fact, it was actually my own kid brother Eugene who had been hired as an engineer to develop the machine that would automatically extrude fillings onto a continuous sheet of egg roll skin, then fold, seal, and cut the product into little pillows. The idea was to develop a line of snack food products for a new company once Chun King had been sold.</p>
<p>While I was working in my own kitchen, I got a call from the vice president in charge of new product development. He asked me to come up with as many new fillings for the egg roll as I could, and he indicated that they did not have to be Asian or “Chinese.”</p>
<p>Fun project. I purchased four-inch square wonton skins for the project and, brainstorming by myself, came up with fifty-five different ideas for fillings that I thought would appeal to the general public. I started out with popular sandwich fillings like cheeseburger, California burger, Reuben sandwich fillings, even peanut butter and jelly—because I was told that the boss really liked his PB &#x26; J sandwiches. Five or six of the fillings were “pizza” flavored, made with Italian sausage, pepperoni, or shrimp, while some of the others included Asian-style ingredients. I made the fillings, noted and recorded their ingredients carefully, sealed them all in egg roll skins, and froze them. To serve, they would simply be reheated in the oven or deep fryer.</p>
<p>The cutting for the egg rolls was to be held later that summer on the grand personal estate belonging to Paulucci, situated on Lake Kabetogama—one of the most beautiful lakes in northern Minnesota. I had two weeks to come up with ideas and product samples. With my prototypes all sealed, packaged, and labeled in the freezer—two dozen of each of the fifty-five flavors—I made the deadline.</p>
<p>On a sunny July morning I was picked up in Duluth by the company plane. We flew north for about forty-five minutes and landed on the still, clear blue waters of one of the grandest lakes in our North Country, in front of the sprawling estate that looked more like a resort than a private home. We unloaded the cooler of frozen egg roll prototypes and toted them into the industrial-sized kitchen of the mansion.</p>
<p>I donned my whites and heated up the commercial-sized deep fryer in the modern, all-stainless kitchen. There were two assistants clothed in white jackets to help me. We didn’t talk much as I wrote out little signs noting the fillings and began cooking the prototype egg rolls.</p>
<p>Around the massive, polished mahogany conference table sat a dozen serious-faced executives in their dark suits, white shirts, and ties. They tasted and evaluated round after round of egg rolls with new fillings. The tastings were headed up by Jeno himself. When the “pizza”-filled egg rolls appeared, the conversation stopped. The other fillings were irrelevant. “That’s it!” he shouted. “Jeno’s Pizza Rolls” were born. The excitement was palpable.</p>
<p>The following week I asked for a twenty-five-cent raise, from $3.50 to $3.75 per hour. The response? “Please don’t ask for that! We can’t afford it.”</p>
<p>Some years later, Paulucci (the hot head) sold his Jeno’s Pizza Rolls brand to the Pillsbury Corporation for $135 million. He died in 2011 at the age of ninety-three. The last time I checked, his $100 million estate was still in litigation. Jeno’s Pizza Rolls are now sold under the brand name of Totino’s.</p>
<p>The moral of this story? “We come into this world with nothing. We leave with nothing.”</p>
<p>When people tell me I should have protested and insisted on more money, all I can do is refer to the biblical story of the workers in the vineyard. I agreed to work for a certain amount, and that is what I received. No more, no less.</p>
