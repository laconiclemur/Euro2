  <body class="calibre"><div xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" id="bm1" class="calibre1"><p class="chn"><b class="calibre4">A note by the author</b></p><p class="ctx"><em class="calibre7">Many of you have chosen this cookbook because you read Hidden in Paris, liked it and wanted more. Thank you for sharing the fun with me. I’m thrilled you are here!</em></p><p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7">Writing in my little room (and by little I mean precisely 8 x 8 feet), alone and without the support and connection of other writers, I struggled for years with nagging thoughts such as “do I have the right to call myself a writer?”, “is this English of Franglish I’m writing in?” and “do NOT think of the package of Milano cookies you hid way in the back of the cupboard.” But above all I struggled with fear. Fear that Hidden in Paris would be a flop and that it would turn me off to writing. Fear that I would not be able to give readers the kind of pleasure I experience when a novel manages to transport me entirely to another place. Fear that bad reviews would drill holes through my insecure heart. At the time I had no readership to speak of, aside from loyal blogging friends who wanted to spread the word and did so enthusiastically as soon as the novel was out.</em></p><p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7">Amazingly, shame and failure did not happen. Better yet: readers who loved the book wrote fantastic reviews that made me cry (all right... I cried over the negative reviews too, but surprisingly they did not kill me), Bloggers worked their magic... and Amazon, Barnes and Nobles, iTunes and many awesome independent book stores did the rest. The novel gained momentum and now sells in a way that makes me smile every day. Hidden in Paris is not a best seller, it is not advertised in the New York Times and Oprah will never review it, but I now get to be a full time, self-employed writer. Sure the boss is a slave driver but I can’t think of a greater job. Freedom, my friends, is sweet. And for this amazing break in my life, I have all of you, my readers, to thank.</em></p><p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7">If you find typos and errors in this cookbook please send an email to yell at me at 
<a href="mailto:corinegantz@live.com">corinegantz@live.com</a>. I’ll correct them right away and will credit you on my website if you’ll allow me. And if you want to write a nice review on Amazon or elsewhere you will have my undying gratitude.</em></p><p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7">Thank you so very much beloved readers, from the bottom of my heart.</em></p></div></body></html>
