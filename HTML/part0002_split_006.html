			<p class="rec-intro">This is a perfect example of something very delicious made with parts of an animal that some might think inedible. It’s best served not too cold so remember to take the dish out of the fridge for a while before serving.</p>

			<p class="body">Place the cleaned pig’s head and cheeks in a large pan with the onion, celery, carrot and herbs. Cover with cold water, add salt and bring to a very gentle simmer. Continue to simmer for 2 hours or until the meat is tender. Leave to cool in the liquid. </p>
			<p class="body">When the head is cool enough to handle, take it out of the pan, keeping the cooking liquid. Bring the cooking liquid to the boil again and cook until reduced. Carefully remove the bones from the head and lay one half, skin-side down, on a tray lined with cling film. Pick the meat off the skin from both halves of the head and shred, then shred the cheek and tongue meat. Add the sliced ears, then season well with salt and pepper and moisten with a little of the reduced cooking liquor. </p>
			<p class="body">Spread this mixture on top of the skin and place the other half, skin-side up, on top. Cover with cling film, place some weights on top and leave in the fridge to set.</p>
			<p class="body">To make the garnish, roast the shallots in their skins at 200°C/Fan 180°C/Gas 6 for 30 minutes. Remove the skins and blitz the flesh until smooth to make a purée. </p>
			<p class="body">Whisk the honey, vinegar and mustard with the oil to make the dressing, then season lightly with salt and pepper. Mix the leaves with the hazelnuts and apple sticks and drizzle with the dressing.</p>
			<p class="body">Cut the pig’s head into slices and serve with the salad, shallot purée and some bread or toasted baguette rubbed with a cut clove of garlic.</p>
