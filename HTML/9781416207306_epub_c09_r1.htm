<h2 class="section"><a id="page229"/>patatas bravas</h2>
<h3 class="section"><a class="hlink" href="9781416207306_epub_c09_r1.htm#page246">see variations</a></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Patatas bravas simply translates as brave potatoes. They are sliced fried potatoes smothered in a rich tomato sauce with a hint of smoky spiciness.</p>
<p class="hanging01">about 1 lb. waxy potatoes (such as Yukon Gold), well scrubbed</p>
<p class="hanging">about 2 cups mild olive oil or sunflower oil for deep-frying</p>
<p class="hanging04">for the tomato sauce</p>
<p class="hanging">3 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">1 small onion</p>
<p class="hanging">1 clove garlic, peeled</p>
<p class="hanging">1 small dried red chile</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 tsp. smoked paprika</p>
<p class="hanging">4 large ripe plum tomatoes, chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tsp. tomato paste</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 cup water</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging02">fresh flat-leaf parsley, to garnish (optional)</p>
<p class="nonindent">Cut the potatoes into even-sized chunks. Add them to a large pan half-filled with the oil and heat gently over a low flame until small bubbles rise to the surface. Cook the potatoes like this — almost poaching them in the oil — for around 12–15 minutes, until they are just tender. Then, increase the heat and deep-fry the potato pieces until golden brown.</p>
<p class="extract">While the potatoes are cooking, prepare the sauce. Heat the oil in a small saucepan. Finely chop the onion, garlic, and chile, and gently fry in the hot oil for 3–4 minutes, until softened but not colored. Stir in the paprika and cook for a few seconds more. Add the tomatoes to the pan. Stir in the tomato paste and water. Cook over low heat for about 10 minutes until the tomatoes are well softened, stirring occasionally. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Lift the potatoes out of the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Put into a warmed dish, add the tomato sauce, and serve.</p>

<div class="dis_img"><img alt="" src="images/9781416207306_149.jpg"/></div>
<h3 class="section"><a class="hlink" href="9781416207306_epub_c09_r1.htm#page247">see variations</a></h3>
<p class="nonindent">The great thing about doing a small tortilla is that it feeds 4 in a tapas portion perfectly, but also allows the dish to be slightly underdone, meaning a gooey middle.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1 medium potato (such as a Yukon Gold), thinly sliced</p>
<p class="hanging">1 cup olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">1 onion, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="hanging">2 large free-range eggs</p>
<p class="hanging">1 free-range egg yolk</p>
<p class="hanging02">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="nonindent">Place the potato slices in a small pan and add all except 1 tablespoon of the oil. Gently heat until the potatoes are just tender, about 8 minutes. Remove from the pan and let cool. In a small pan, heat the remaining olive oil over low heat. Add the sliced onions and fry very slowly for 10–15 minutes until they have really softened and started to turn golden. Remove from the pan and let cool. Mix the potato, eggs, and egg yolk thoroughly, and season with salt and pepper. Add the onions before pouring the whole lot into a small skillet, preferably about 4 inches in diameter. Turn the heat down to its lowest setting immediately.</p>
<p class="extract">Every now and then, draw the edge in gently with a spatula, as this will give it a lovely rounded edge. When it is firm and sealed on the outside but still a little gooey in the middle, turn it over to cook the other side. To do this, place a flat lid or plate over the pan and carefully invert both so that the omelet is on the lid or plate. Put the pan back on the heat and use the spatula to gently ease the omelet back in. Give it about 2 minutes more, then turn the heat off and leave it for a further 5 minutes to settle. It should then be cooked through but still moist, even a bit runny in the center.</p>

<p class="nonindent">When small zucchini flower in summer, they are a treat to behold. They are perfect for stuffing and require little time to cook. Honey might seem a surprising ingredient in this dish, but lavender honey has a more savory flavor than most honey and beautifully complements the salty goat cheese.</p>
<p class="hanging01">vegetable oil for deep-frying</p>
<p class="hanging">4 small zucchini with flowers attached</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 cup (3 1/2 oz.) soft goat cheese</p>
<p class="hanging">zest of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="hanging">4 tbsp. all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. cornstarch</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">ice-cold sparkling water</p>
<p class="hanging02">1 tbsp. lavender honey</p>
<p class="nonindent">Heat the oil in a deep-fat fryer or wok to 350°F. Wipe the zucchini clean with a damp towel and then gently pry open the flower petals. Whip together the goat cheese and lemon zest and split it between the flowers. Seal the petals around the filling to encase it.</p>
<p class="extract">Gently mix together the flour and cornstarch with the salt and pepper. Whisk in just enough sparkling water to make a medium-thick batter (a bit thinner than a pancake batter). Plunge the zucchini and flowers into the batter to entirely coat them and then, one by one, place them into the hot oil to cook for 4–6 minutes or until the batter is crisp and golden. Scoop out and drain on paper towels. Lay on a serving plate and drizzle with the honey and more sea salt and black pepper.</p>

<p class="nonindent">While the ingredients are simple the result is excellent. Garlic really brings out the flavor of mushrooms. Make sure you have plenty of bread to soak up the delicious juices.</p>
<p class="hanging01">2 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">5 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="hanging">1 lb. fresh mushrooms (a mix of varieties if you desire), cleaned and sliced</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 cup dry sherry</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</p>
<p class="hanging02">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="nonindent">Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat until hot. Add the garlic and sauté until it begins to turn golden. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring vigorously, until golden brown. Add the dry sherry, bring to a boil, and continue to cook for 1 minute. Stir in the parsley and season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a serving dish.</p>

<p class="nonindent">The combination of ingredients for this delicious savory pastry is classic. The great news is that it works brilliantly with a whole variety of other options. You can freeze what you don’t eat, or just eat the leftovers as snacks. You can also make this several hours in advance and bake it just before serving.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1/2 lb. feta cheese</p>
<p class="hanging">1 lb. ricotta</p>
<p class="hanging">10 oz. baby spinach, cooked and chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">1 bunch scallions, finely sliced</p>
<p class="hanging">1 green chile, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan</p>
<p class="hanging">1 egg</p>
<p class="hanging">a good grating nutmeg</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 cup fresh white bread crumbs</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging02">6 sheets phyllo pastry, trimmed to snugly fit baking pan</p>
<p class="nonindent">Heat oven to 350°F. Mash feta in a large mixing bowl, add the ricotta, and mash again to thoroughly mix. Stir in the spinach, scallions, chile, Parmesan, egg, nutmeg, and plenty of salt and pepper with half the bread crumbs.</p>
<p class="extract">Brush an 8 × 12–inch baking pan with a little olive oil. Layer half the phyllo sheets into the pan, brushing each with oil before adding the next. Scatter with the remaining bread crumbs.</p>
<p class="extract">Spoon in the ricotta filling and gently spread over the phyllo, so as not to move around the bread crumbs. Cover with the remaining phyllo, brushing with oil as you go, and finishing with a good coating of oil on top. Score into small triangular portions. Bake for 35–40 minutes until golden and crisp.</p>

<p class="nonindent">A whole globe artichoke becomes a magical treat as you peel off the leaves, dip, and eat as you work your way to the more meaty heart. To serve this, everyone just reaches into the center of the table where you have the single artichoke on a plate and the vinaigrette in a bowl next to it — just dunk away and eat together.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1 large globe artichoke</p>
<p class="hanging">juice and zest of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="hanging">1/3 cup dry bread crumbs</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. grated Parmesan cheese</p>
<p class="hanging">pinch dried red pepper flakes</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. assorted chopped fresh herbs</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging04">for the vinaigrette</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tsp. Dijon mustard</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. sherry vinegar</p>
<p class="hanging">squeeze of lemon juice</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging02">3 tbsp. good Spanish olive oil</p>
<p class="nonindent">Simmer the artichoke in salted water, which has been acidulated with a good squeeze of lemon juice, for 30 minutes, or until the leaves can be removed with a slight tug. Remove the artichoke from the water. While still warm, press the leaves gently back, leaving them attached, so that the artichoke resembles a flower. Pull out the small white and purple center leaves and scrape out the choke (the fuzzy part) with a spoon. Stand the artichoke upright in a small baking dish. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan, lemon zest, red pepper flakes, herbs, and oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pack the mixture into the artichoke. Bake for 25 minutes or until golden. Meanwhile, make the vinaigrette by whisking together all the ingredients until thick and emulsified. To eat the artichoke, pull the leaves off, dip into the vinaigrette and scrape the soft base of the leaf off with your teeth. When you’ve finished the leaves, eat the rest of the heart.</p>

<p class="nonindent">A spring vegetable native to the Mediterranean, asparagus is well worth the wait for its unbeatable flavor and freshness. This dish is so simple to prepare and the combination of textures from the asparagus, spinach, and pine nuts is a treat.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1 bunch asparagus (about 12 spears)</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">2 cloves garlic, chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">pinch dried red pepper flakes</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. pine nuts</p>

<p class="nonindent">Bring a pot of salted water to a boil, then plunge the asparagus in for 2 minutes. Drain and place the asparagus in ice-cold water.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat the oil in a skillet. Add the garlic, red pepper flakes, and pine nuts, then sauté gently for 1–2 minutes until the garlic and pine nuts turn lightly golden. Add the spinach and sauté until just wilted. Finally add the asparagus, and fry for another minute before seasoning with salt and pepper. Tumble the whole ensemble onto a plate and serve immediately.</p>

<p class="nonindent">This tasty but light dish is made all the more special when drizzled with a little truffle oil. Celeriac brings an unusual freshness of flavor to the gratin, cutting through the richness of the cream.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1 floury potato (such as russet), peeled</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 lb. celeriac, peeled</p>
<p class="hanging">1/4 cup whipping cream</p>
<p class="hanging">1 clove garlic, crushed</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. (1/4 stick) butter</p>
<p class="hanging02">1 tsp. truffle oil</p>
<p class="nonindent">Preheat the oven to 350°F. Using a mandoline or very sharp knife, thinly slice the potato and celeriac.</p>
<p class="extract">Place the cream, garlic, and butter in a large heavy pan and bring to a boil. Stir in the sliced celeriac and potato to coat them in the mixture, then remove the pan from the heat. Stir in the truffle oil.</p>
<p class="extract">Layer the coated slices of potato and celeriac in a small, deep baking dish, pressing down as you go. Pour the remaining sauce over them. Bake for 45–60 minutes, or until tender all the way through. Serve hot.</p>

<p class="nonindent">The bitterness of Belgian endive combined with toasted walnuts and sweet pomegranate gives this dish a delightful nutty-fruity Middle Eastern feel. The best way to extract pomegranate seeds from the fruit is to cut it in half and then hit the back with a spoon. The fresh red seeds will fly out to be collected and used.</p>
<p class="hanging01">2 heads Belgian endive, halved through the stem</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. roughly chopped walnuts</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. pomegranate molasses</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tsp. walnut oil</p>
<p class="hanging02">1/3 cup pomegranate seeds (arils)</p>
<p class="nonindent">Heat a griddle pan until almost smoking. Rub the endive with half the olive oil, salt, and pepper. Lay the endive in the pan, cut-side down, and cook for 2 minutes, then turn over and cook for a minute on the other side. Remove and set on a serving plate.</p>
<p class="extract">In a separate pan, heat the remaining olive oil. Add the walnuts and toast for 1–2 minutes or until they have become toasty and golden. Remove from the heat and whisk in the molasses and walnut oil.</p>
<p class="extract">Pour the dressing over the endive. Top with the pomegranate seeds and serve.</p>

<p class="nonindent">This is great food eaten at its best. The creamy curd cheese slowly melts into the warm lentils, while the beets release their juices. All the flavors ooze together. If you cannot find goat’s curd, a very young and soft chèvre (goat cheese) will make a fine substitute.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1/2 cup lentils du Puy (small French-style lentils)</p>
<p class="hanging">2 small shallots, finely sliced</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tomato, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">3 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</p>

<p class="hanging">sea salt and ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">1/4 lb. goat’s curd or a young, soft chèvre</p>
<p class="hanging02">1 medium beet, roasted, peeled, and thickly sliced</p>
<p class="nonindent">Place the lentils in a pan of boiling water. Do not add salt or this will toughen the lentils. Boil for 25 minutes or until tender. Remove, drain, and let steam off the heat for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="extract">Combine the lentils, shallots, tomato, oil, vinegar, and mint. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside to marinate for another 5–10 minutes.</p>
