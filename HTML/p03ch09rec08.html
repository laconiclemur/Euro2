<p class="chapterSubtitle">{ <span class="bi-color">pintada rellena de mazapán y frutos secos–balearic islands</span> }</p>
</div>
<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">This dish of medieval origin is still cooked in the houses of the Majorcan nobility. Wild guinea fowl disappeared from the island years ago, but they are now farmed. Their flavor is only slightly gamy, less assertive than that of pheasant or partridge. Guinea fowl have little fat and need barding (covering with pancetta or bacon before roasting) so that the flesh remains juicy. The stuffing recipe here makes more than will fill the cavities of the guinea fowl, because it is so delicious you will want to have extra. The extra is cooked separately in foil. Alternatively, rather than stuffing the birds, you can cook all the stuffing separately (see the variations).</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4</span></p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE STUFFING</span></p>
<p class="qun">5 ounces soft pitted prunes</p>
<p class="qun">¼ pound soft dried apricots</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup blanched whole almonds</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup sugar</p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon orange blossom water (optional)</p>
<p class="qun">1 large egg yolk</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE GUINEA FOWL</span></p>
<p class="qun">2 large guinea fowl (about 2 pounds each)</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">2 tablespoons olive oil or butter</p>
<p class="qun">½ pound thinly sliced pancetta or bacon</p>
<p class="qun1">1 cup dry white wine or fino sherry</p>
<p class="recsum">For the stuffing, boil the prunes and apricots in just enough water to cover over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, until they are very soft; drain.</p>
<p class="summary">Finely grind the almonds with the sugar in a food processor. Add the orange blossom water, if using, and the egg yolk and blend to a soft paste, adding a few drops of water if necessary to bind it. Mix the paste with the drained fruit in a bowl.</p>
<p class="summary">Rub the guinea fowl with salt and pepper and the oil or butter. With a narrow spoon, fill the cavities of each one with the stuffing. Wrap the extra stuffing in an oiled sheet of foil, and put it in the oven for the last 30 minutes of cooking.</p>
<p class="summary">Wrap the birds with the pancetta or bacon. Put them breast side down in a high-sided baking dish that holds them snugly. Pour in the wine, cover loosely with foil, and roast in a preheated 400°F oven for 1 hour.</p>
<p class="summary">Turn the birds over, cover them again with the foil, and roast for 15 minutes. Remove the foil and roast for about 15 minutes more, or until the legs pull away from the body and the juices run clear when the thigh is pierced. The flesh should not be red.</p>
<p class="summary">Serve with the pan juices, accompanied by the extra stuffing.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATIONS</span></p>
<p class="bl-first">• You can cook all of the stuffing separately. Put it in a lightly greased small baking dish. Press it down firmly and cover with foil. Put the dish in the oven with the guinea fowl for the last 30 minutes of cooking. As the birds are not stuffed, they may need only about 1 hour of cooking.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• Soak the prunes and apricots in brandy instead of boiling them in water.</p>
<p class="bl-last">• Instead of the almond paste, add ⅓ cup raisins and ⅓ cup toasted pine nuts.</p>
