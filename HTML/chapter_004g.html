<h2 class="h2b">DAUBE DE SANGLIER</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Wild Boar Braised in Red Wine</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>A whole chapter could be devoted to the making of daube, a combination of ingredients united by their time together and set off by the unmistakable bitter-sweet zest of orange. But, like bouillabaisse, everyone in Provence has their ‘best’ way of making it, and it’s hard to say which is authentic. I have added a few tricks to the old recipes I have read and eaten, and this dish, gently cooked, will fill your kitchen with warmth and wonderful aromas</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
1kg (2lb 4oz) of the fattiest part of the boar shoulder, cut into large chunks<br/>
1 bottle full-bodied red wine<br/>
50ml (2fl oz) olive oil<br/>
50g (1¾ oz) butter<br/>
16 large shallots, peeled<br/>
16 large garlic cloves, peeled<br/>
2 large tbsp tomato concentrate<br/>
2 tbsp plain flour<br/>
30g (1¼ oz) dried ceps<br/>
1 large sprig fresh thyme or savory<br/>
8 strips Dried Orange Zest (<em><a href="chapter_006j.html#page173">see here</a></em>)<br/>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>
Caster sugar</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 110°C/225°F/Gas ¼.</p>
<p class="normala">Put the boar chunks into a suitable dish. Reduce the wine by half at a rolling boil and let it cool for a few minutes, then pour it over the chunks of boar. Mix them about well and let them marinate for around 12 hours, turning them every now and then.</p>
<p class="normala">Once marinated, remove the boar from the wine and pat it dry on a kitchen cloth. Heat your pan with the olive oil until it is smoking, then add the boar. It should only be in a single layer and if your pan is not big enough, do this part in two batches. Brown the pieces really well on all sides for about 10 minutes, then drain off the fat and add the butter. Be really careful at this stage that the butter does not go past the ‘noisette’ stage, where it is a dark tan colour and has an aroma of hazelnuts. Sauté the boar, turning it occasionally for 10 minutes or so more, until totally coloured on all sides. Add the peeled shallots and garlic and turn up the heat to colour them a little for about 2 minutes, then spoon in the tomato concentrate and cook for a few minutes until this is really dark as well. Next add the flour and stir it until it is well darkened, then pour over the wine and enough water just to cover the meat. Lastly put in the ceps, thyme and dried orange zest.</p>
<p class="normala">Bring all of this to the boil then cover the pot and cook it for at least 2½ hours in the preheated low oven. Do check it frequently: the liquid should never boil (however, the checking is worth it just for the scent). You will of course have to taste the meat to see if it is ready: it should be tender enough to eat with a spoon.</p>
<p class="normala">Gently lift out the boar, shallots and garlic, and discard the ceps, orange zest and herb. Reduce the sauce until it is nice and thick and very concentrated in taste, then return the boar, shallots and garlic to it. Season well with some salt, pepper and sugar. Warm through and eat it either with wide pasta or boiled potatoes.</p>
