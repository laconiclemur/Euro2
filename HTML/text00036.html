<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">The End-of-Summer Prize</a>
</h1>
<p class="pf">I joined the local 4-H club as an adolescent, not necessarily to learn to cook but because I wanted to win a trip to the State Fair. Still, I enrolled in one food-related project after another. Each came with a bulletin outlining basic important things to know and learn, along with a report form. The reports were such fun to write. I had to keep track of everything I prepared and cooked throughout the year. By the end of the year the report was so bulky it almost constituted a cookbook by itself!</p>
<p>Food preparation, food preservation, bread baking, canning, clothing construction, and dairy foods were among my favorite personal project choices. All of the projects were interesting to me, and I concentrated on them one at a time.</p>
<p>I entered in the food preparation category by planning food demonstrations to compete for a trip to the State Fair in August.</p>
<p>The first year, I offered a demonstration making an egg salad sandwich and an eggnog. During that first competition I learned two valuable lessons: always have “standby” ingredients, and be more prepared for probing questions by the judges. The first step of the competition started with the local clubs, proceeded to the county competition, and from there the possibility of winning that coveted trip to the State Fair.</p>
<p>Nervously, I lined up all of the ingredients for my sandwich and eggnog on a tray—slices of homemade bread, butter, a hard-cooked egg; milk, eggs, sugar, and vanilla for the eggnog. I had another tray holding the utensils that I would need. I was careful to plan for a space between the trays for my “show and tell.” I tied my hair back and put on a clean apron, and when my turn came up, I nervously carried my trays to the counter in the home economics department of the Floodwood school where the local competition was always held.</p>
<p>Two judges—looking very official—sat in front of me with notepads and pens. At this point I realized how utterly unprepared I was. I picked up my single hard-cooked egg and cracked it open. The yolk bounced out of the white and rolled down the counter, over the edge, and onto the floor. I ran after it and plopped it into the bowl and continued with my demonstration. What I should have done is have another egg ready, and I could have explained just how that egg should have been cooked perfectly. I got a red ribbon on my demonstration, not good enough to proceed to the county competition.</p>
<p>The following year I chose to demonstrate the making of cottage cheese. In fact, I even made my own version of a cheddar cheese by draining the cottage cheese, pressing it into a mold, and brining the finished product. That was good for a blue ribbon at the county fair—but still not good enough to win a trip to the State Fair.</p>
<p class="psec">With a year to contemplate my next attempt to win the end-of-summer prize, I chose to demonstrate my mother’s favorite—a special chiffon cake that she made for every birthday or whenever we needed something special. Mummy loved to make chiffon cakes—she felt it was a “healthy” cake because it used so many eggs and a small amount of sugar. People always marveled at the flavor and texture of this cake that was seldom frosted, just dusted with a bit of powdered sugar. For variety, sometimes we would drizzle it with a thin powdered sugar icing. The cake is one that first appeared in a Betty Crocker leaflet and is still being published today. I worked on the recipe and when we didn’t have oranges on hand, I’d make it with lemons.</p>
<p>In preparation for the next year’s competition and attempt to win a trip to the State Fair, I learned as much as I could about the leavening properties, the sizes of eggs, how to properly separate the egg yolk from the whites, and how to whip the whites. Since we had a coop full of chickens we had no shortage of eggs. After baking cake after cake, I had the demonstration down so pat that I could practice the talking parts without actually making cakes. I needed to be so prepared that there would be no gaps in things to say as I whisked, stirred, and folded the batter in front of the judges and my friends. I made the orange-flavored spongy cake, but talked about all the different variations on the theme. There was no end to my jabbering—the more I learned, the more there was to talk about!</p>
<p>I practiced my demonstration all year: while milking cows, while pitching hay from the loft, and while shoveling manure from the gutters in the barn. Farmwork can be somewhat mindless physical labor, but when I had my demonstration to think about the work went quickly. I used to wonder if the cows had learned how to make a chiffon cake themselves after that year.</p>
<p>All summer long I baked cake after cake. We gave these cakes to friends and neighbors and still had enough for my dad and his hired workers. I made a cake for my ailing grandmother on her birthday in June 1950.</p>
<p>I even baked a cake for my friend, the other Beatrice in my school class. On her birthday I put the cake in the basket of my bicycle and pumped the eight miles to her home to present her with her birthday cake. Beatrice was the oldest child in her family and had four or five siblings. They lived in a small two-room house and didn’t have animals and gardens like we did. It was the only birthday cake she had that year.</p>

<p>Soon it was August and time to put my demonstration together. I carefully planned my presentation and reviewed all the information I had learned about cooking with eggs, their nutritional qualities and why eggs a couple of days old whipped up better than freshly laid ones, the kind of flour that is best to use in a cake, and why mixing techniques are so important. I described the “folding of whipped whites into the basic cake.”</p>
<p>When I presented my demonstration at the South St. Louis County Fair in Proctor, I won the coveted trip to the Minnesota State Fair. It was all worth it.</p>
<p>At the State Fair in St. Paul that year we were housed in the 4-H building, where we were assigned to triple bunk beds and given tickets for three meals a day in the dining hall. After breakfast we headed out onto the fairgrounds to enjoy the special exhibits and food. Spudnuts—raised glazed doughnuts made with potato water as the base (hence the name)—cost a nickel and was the first booth we hit. We enjoyed one every day after as well. Then we’d hit the booth where we could drink all the free milk we wanted, another favorite. Machinery Hill, where all the cute boys hung out, was the most fun. We weren’t fond of the Midway because it was too expensive, hot, and crowded, but the cattle barns, horticulture building, and all the other exhibit buildings consumed our time.</p>

<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Lemon or Orange Chiffon Cake</a>
</p>
<p class="rpf">The basic chiffon cake is flavored with lemon or orange, rises into a spongy texture because of the beaten eggs, and is leavened also with baking powder. It’s an interesting sponge type of cake that absorbs fruit juices beautifully, making it a great cake to serve with fresh berries or a juicy fruit—like pineapple.</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpilf">2 cups all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="rpil">1½ cups granulated sugar</p>
<p class="rpil">3 teaspoons baking powder</p>
<p class="rpil">1 teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="rpil">¾ cup cold water</p>
<p class="rpil">½ cup vegetable oil</p>
<p class="rpil">2 teaspoons vanilla</p>
<p class="rpil">2 teaspoons grated lemon or orange zest</p>
<p class="rpil">7 egg yolks</p>
<p class="rpil">1 cup egg whites (8 eggs)</p>
<p class="rpill">½ teaspoon cream of tartar</p>
</div>
<p class="rph1">Lemon Glaze</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpil">⅓ cup butter or margarine</p>
<p class="rpil">2 cups powdered sugar</p>
<p class="rpil">½ teaspoon grated lemon or orange zest</p>
<p class="rpill">2 to 4 tablespoons hot lemon or orange juice</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">Move oven rack to lowest position. Heat oven to 325°F. In large bowl, mix flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Beat in cold water, oil, vanilla, lemon zest, and egg yolks until smooth.</p>
<p class="rp">In large bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar with electric mixer on high speed until stiff peaks form. Gradually pour egg yolk mixture over beaten egg whites, folding with rubber spatula just until blended. Pour into ungreased 10-inch angel food (tube) cake pan.</p>
<p class="rp">Bake about 1 hour 15 minutes or until top springs back when touched lightly. Immediately turn pan upside down onto heatproof funnel or bottle. Let hang until completely cool, about 2 hours. Loosen side of cake with knife or long, metal spatula; remove from pan.</p>
<p class="rpl">In 1½-quart saucepan, melt butter over low heat; remove from heat. Stir in powdered sugar and lemon zest until smooth. Stir in lemon juice, 1 tablespoon at a time, until smooth and consistency of thick syrup. Spread glaze over top of cake, allowing some to drizzle down side.</p>
