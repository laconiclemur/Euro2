<p class="recipe_hdnote">To form a smooth emulsion, it is important that all of the ingredients are at the same temperature. Use a light or mild olive oil—not extra-virgin, which makes the mayonnaise quite heavy. Blending mild olive oil with sunflower oil will make an even lighter mayonnaise. The easiest way to prepare this recipe is with an immersion hand blender, though a food processor works, too. Instructions for both methods follow. It is frequently spelled <em>mahonesa</em>, which clearly reflects its origin in Mahón, Menorca.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 EGG, AT ROOM TEMPERATURE</li>
<li>SALT</li>
<li>WHITE WINE VINEGAR</li>
<li>¾ CUP/180 ML MILD OLIVE OIL, OR A BLEND OF MILD OLIVE OIL AND SUNFLOWER OR CANOLA OIL</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><em>Using an immersion hand blender:</em> In a tall, narrow, and cylindrical container (ideally just wider than the shaft), add—in this order—the egg, a pinch of salt, some drops of vinegar, and the olive oil. While still turned off, place the blender shaft in the bottom of the container. Turn on the blender to three-fourths speed and begin blending. Once the emulsion begins to form, slowly bring the end of the shaft up through the oil and just out, and then slowly back down to the bottom. Bring it up once more and out. Total blending time is 30 seconds to 1 minute. The emulsion should be creamy, without any oil pooled on the surface. If needed, lower the shaft slowly back down to the bottom and out again.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><em>Using a food processor:</em> Add the egg, a pinch of salt, and some drops of vinegar. Begin whirring the food processor and add in the olive oil in a very slow but steady stream until all of the oil has been used and the emulsion has thickened to the consistency of creamy mayonnaise. It should not have any oil pooled on the surface. Total blending time is about 1 minute.</p>
<p class="method_txt">Transfer the mayonnaise to a bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve, for up to 2 days. Just before serving, rewhisk with a fork.</p>
