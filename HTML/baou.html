<p class="normal1"><span class="smallcaps">I FIRST MET</span> Peter and Diana Knab in 1995 while working with Raymond Blanc on <em>A Blanc Christmas</em>. We became close friends and, one evening, at a jazz club in Soho, we hatched a plot that was to become Le Baou d’Infer Cookery School. Pete and Di were looking for an excuse to spend more time at their house in Provence. An Antipodean chef-teacher, young enough to be their son, was an unlikely part of that plan, but the seed was sown. The logistics were discussed, and soon the house was being adapted to its new role.</p>
<p class="normala">We agreed to run the school for five years and to give it everything we had during that time. Our guests came from all over the world to be captured by the joy of cooking in Provence. Their ages, backgrounds and abilities varied enormously but the beauty and bounty of Le Baou and Provence brought them together. Many returned each year and the feel was that of a house party with a never-ending stream of meals, conversation and laughter.</p>
<p class="normala">Our days began early and finished late but were so much fun that time slipped by unnoticed. I was never more alive than when I was in a happy and very noisy group of students, with pans, produce and ideas circling the kitchen. It was sharing rather than teaching; talking about, touching, smelling and greedily tasting the ingredients and dishes.</p>
<p class="normala">Pete was the head wine buyer and taster (the wine cellar was referred to as Pete’s corner) and host. He also became an ace barterer and spotter of quality ingredients. Our suppliers were sure to have their best produce ready for his daily visit to Cogolin. They’d also quite happily halt the mid-morning traffic to load up his car. Di was the busiest of us all. She never stopped, be it banishing weeds from her huge and beautiful garden, keeping the house running or regaling us all with hilarious tales of her travelling days. Pete would play the straight man to some of these stories but occasionally insist on different versions of the wilder ones.</p>
<p class="normala">We gave it all we had and the house was full for five years and we look back with great pride at the success that was Le Baou d’Infer Cookery School.</p>
<p class="normala">There are days when I miss it terribly. When I do, I open this book and I look at the pictures and I read. Each recipe is a memory: I remember our guests cooking the dishes and I remember their pleasure. I go to my kitchen, I cook and I smell and I taste my way back to my beloved Provence. Join me.</p>
