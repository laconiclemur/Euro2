<p class="noindent"><span class="stickup">F</span>or many Italian Americans growing up in the sixties and seventies, delicious food was considered a birthright. In our family we were foragers for blackberries, garden growers of romano beans and zucchini, pesto makers, and antipasto Mafiosi, often working in groups across generations. For the summer harvesttimes we would head out to the lower Yakima valley and buy fragrant tomatoes, still on the vine, Kirby cukes, baby onions, eggplants, tiny mushrooms, sweet Walla Walla onions—anything we could get our hands on—and head back to the house. There we would separate as teams and attack the joyous stash with fervor in an organized way to create bread-and-butter pickles, blackberry jam and pies, dilly beans, and the highly revered “antipasto,” a mix of vegetables including baby onions, mushrooms, and herbs, all cooked in a tomato sauce with canned tuna. We preserved it all in mason jars and stashed it in our cellars, or in our case, the garage, right next to the deep freezer, which held the treasure trove of wild salmon, elk meat, moose burger, duck meat, and homemade sausages, a taste of everything each of our cousins and family members had harvested in their own way.</p>
<p class="indent">Italian Americans, like many immigrant populations in America, brought their food ideology to the New World, and in the best cases a hybrid was formed. The real secret is that we Italians never, or very rarely, ate out at a restaurant. It rarely occurred to us that the local diner or casual restaurant might serve something we wanted to eat. It never occurred to us that we might go out and spend money for dinner.</p>
<p class="indent">We knew a secret in our hearts that we did not tell anyone about. We ate better at home than anyone on the block, even on Tuesdays. Sunday supper was a nearly religious experience and a call to arms for every member invited to the table at our house, or Grandma’s <a id="page_ix"/>house or Aunt Izzy’s house. For us, a restaurant meal was an oddity, a strange and special occasion, a treat as a reward for really good behavior over a long period of time or for a celebration such as my first communion, which was a brunch at the Space Needle. An exotic trip may have occasionally been made to Herfy’s for a cheeseburger deluxe or to the Fireside Inn for a fancy piled-high sandwich, big enough for two people! But we knew it was momentary dalliance from the true food at hand, the food of our family.</p>
<p class="indent">Stanley Tucci’s family hailed from sweet and piquant Calabria, different in many ways from my Tuscan and Abruzzese roots (not to mention the French Canadian ones, equally food gifted), but we share a similar food youth. We celebrated the deliciousness in our households and cherish the fine and exact memories of the food we considered love and family, but that our non-Italian neighbors considered odd or silly. In his tangy and bittersweet film <span class="txit">Big Night,</span> Stanley illuminated the remarkable and exquisite complexity of the Italian American experience in a brand-new light. The two brothers struggled with the battle between the gastronomic truth of their hearts and the reality of uneducated American customers and the rules of good business. The film was a microcosm of the Italian immigrant experience in the United States. In the Washington State sixties of my youth, there was none of the hipness and “holy grail”–ness of Italian food that developed in the eighties. Although everyone had little gardens in our development, we were the oddballs in suburban Seattle, making and eating the likes of calves’ brain and swiss chard ravioli and oxtails in ragù.</p>
<p class="indent">Stanley has created a love letter to his mom and dad, to his distant roots in Calabria, and to the whole Italian American experience: delicious, odd to the outsider, but more than family to us. The story of Joan and Stan Sr.’s experiences is as much the heart and soul of this book as the recipes handed down from the families and modified slightly by each generation. This story and recipes, alongside those of Chef Gianni Scappin’s family, who hail from the cooler Veneto region of Italy, create a book rich with culinary diversity.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="txit">The Tucci Cookbook</span> is the new gold standard in the translation of the Italian American immigrant experience, and the happy ending is that we can all share it, personalize it, and call it our own, just as the Italians would expect.</p>
