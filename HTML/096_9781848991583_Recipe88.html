<p class="normal"><b>This was a bit of a discovery for me. I’ve been thinking about making a goat milk ice cream for some time and I was really pleased with the results, both because it is easy to make and the lift from the lime zest is perfect. Buy raspberries in season for the best flavor and you need a very good, aged balsamic vinegar for the marinade—one that is slightly syrupy, but not too acidic—and the age will be specified on the label if it is a really good product. The Langues de Chat (see <a href="092_9781848991583_Recipe84.html#pageid_139">page 139</a>) go really well with this, too. The finished dessert is summer itself!</b></p>

<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon fennel seeds</p>
<p class="acktxta">1 tablespoon confectioner’s sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE GOAT MILK ICE CREAM</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">1¼ cups goat milk</p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons goat cream</p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons plain goat milk yogurt</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 cup confectioner’s sugar</p>
<p class="acktxta">finely grated zest of ½ lime</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE BALSAMIC AND LIME RASPBERRIES</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">1⅔ cups raspberries</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</p>
<p class="acktxt">finely grated zest of ½ lime, plus extra for sprinkling</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 drops lime juice</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Line a medium-deep freezerproof tray with parchment paper. Put all the ice cream ingredients in a bowl and whisk together until smooth. Pour the mixture into the prepared tray and freeze for at least 3 hours, or until hard. Remove from the freezer and break into small chunks, then put them into a food processor and blend briefly to a smooth, firm puree; you don’t want the mixture to thaw too much. Spoon the mxiture into a small freezerproof container, smooth the top, cover and return to the freezer at least 25 to 30 minutes until hard again.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Meanwhile, put the raspberries in a large bowl with 2 tablespoons of the balsamic vinegar, the lime zest and juice. Gently stir until combined, cover with plastic wrap and put in the refrigerator.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Heat the oven to 400°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Put the fennel seeds on the prepared baking sheet and dust with the confectioner’s sugar until lightly coated. Put in the oven 4 to 5 minutes until light golden and caramelized. Return the baking sheet to the oven a couple of minutes at a time if the seeds are not ready. Remove the baking sheet and leave the seeds to cool, breaking up any that might have stuck together.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Remove the raspberries from the refrigerator and, using a slotted spoon, spoon into serving bowls. Put a small scoop of ice cream on top of each bowl of raspberries. Drizzle any of the liquid from the raspberries and the remaining balsamic vinegar over the top and finish with a scattering of caramelized fennel seeds and a little extra lime zest. Serve with <i>langues de chat</i>.</p>
