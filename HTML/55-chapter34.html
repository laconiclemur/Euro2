<p class="yield">MAKES ABOUT 40 CROQUETTES</p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Spanish croquettes are not like French ones made with potatoes, or those large, round Sicilian <em>arancini</em> with rice. Rather, they use a thick, béchamel-like sauce as a base. To this, a host of flavors are added, ranging from cured jamón to salt cod. But chicken is perhaps the most common, and remains a beloved Spanish classic.</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">     To freeze, roll the uncooked croquettes in egg and breadcrumbs and freeze in batches. Take them from the freezer and fry directly, without thawing. See the headnote on <a href="54-chapter33.html#page_76"><span class="red">page 76</span></a> about changing the oil during frying.</span></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>1 TABLESPOON EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL</li>
<li>12 OUNCES/340 G BONELESS SKINLESS CHICKEN BREAST</li>
<li>SALT</li>
<li>½&gt; CUP/110 G BUTTER, CUT INTO PIECES</li>
<li>1 MEDIUM ONION, VERY FINELY CHOPPED</li>
<li>3 CUPS/720 ML WHOLE MILK</li>
<li>FRESHLY GROUND BLACK PEPPER</li>
<li>PINCH FRESHLY GRATED NUTMEG</li>
<li>1 CUP/125 G ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR, PLUS MORE FOR DUSTING</li>
<li>2 EGGS</li>
<li>1 CUP/140 G FINE BREADCRUMBS</li>
<li>SUNFLOWER OIL OR MILD OLIVE OIL FOR FRYING</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> In a skillet or sauté pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Season the chicken with salt and sauté until cooked through, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a platter to cool. Cut the chicken into pieces and grind with a food processor.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a clean skillet or sauté pan, melt the butter over medium heat and add the onion. Cook over medium-low heat, until soft and transparent but not yet browned, about 12 minutes.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, bring the milk to a simmer; season with salt, pepper, and the nutmeg. Reduce the heat, cover the pan, and keep hot.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Sift the flour into the skillet over the onion and cook, stirring constantly, for about 2 minutes. It should be a compact and just-moist ball. Spread out the ball in the pan and begin slowly stirring in the hot milk until the mixture is creamy and not too sticky when touched, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and fold in the ground chicken. Cook, gently stirring, for 2 minutes. The mixture should be spongy and can be touched without sticking to your finger.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><a id="page_80"/><span class="font2">5.</span> Transfer the mixture to a large bowl to cool. Once cool, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for several hours until chilled. (This will make forming the croquettes easier.)</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">6.</span> On a flat work surface dusted with flour, form croquettes into 2- to 2½&gt;-inch-/5- to 6.25-cm-long cylinders about 1 inch/2.5 cm in diameter. Lightly roll in flour.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">7.</span> Break the eggs in a bowl and thoroughly whisk. Place the breadcrumbs in a second bowl.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">8.</span> Dip the croquettes in the egg and roll in breadcrumbs to completely cover.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">9.</span> In a skillet or sauté pan, heat at least ¾ inch/2 cm of sunflower oil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">10.</span> Working in small batches that don’t crowd the pan, fry the croquettes, turning frequently, until they are golden on the outside and hot and creamy at the center, about 2 minutes. Gently transfer them to absorbent paper towels to drain off excess oil. Serve hot.</p>
