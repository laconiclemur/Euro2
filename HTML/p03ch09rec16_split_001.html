<p class="summary"><span class="italic">In his book</span> Homage to Catalonia, <span class="italic">written in 1937, George Orwell described the way peasants spread out nets over the grass at night and then lay down on the ground making noises like female quail. When male quail came running, they got entangled in the nets. Although European Union rules have made it illegal, it is still a Mediterranean custom to catch migrating birds that fly over the sea in big nets. In Cyprus, where hunting is a large-scale activity, endless tapes of birdsong are played to lure birds into the nets. But in Spain, as in the United States, most quail you find now are farmed.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">The onions take a long time to caramelize; they are delicious with the added brandy.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 2 AS A MAIN COURSE; 4 AS A STARTER</span></p>
<p class="qun">5 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">2 large onions, cut in half and sliced</p>
<p class="qun">4 quail</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup brandy, or to taste</p>
<p class="qun1">4 slices country bread, fried in olive oil or toasted</p>
<p class="recsum">Heat the oil in a wide heavy skillet or casserole. Put in the onions, cover, and cook slowly over very low heat, stirring often, for about 30 minutes, until very soft and beginning to color.</p>
<p class="summary">Push the onions to one side of the pot, put in the quail, season with salt and pepper, and turn up the heat to medium. Turn the quail to brown them all over, and stir the onions occasionally so that they brown evenly. Add the brandy, and cook over low heat until the onions are caramelized and the quail are done; this will take about 25 to 30 minutes. Pull the leg of one of the quail: if it moves easily, and the juices run clear when you cut in between the body and a leg, they are done.</p>
<p class="summary">Serve on the toasted or fried bread.</p>
