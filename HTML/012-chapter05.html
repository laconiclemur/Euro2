<p class="chapterOpenerText" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">D</span></span><span class="italic">uring the Renaissance, Italian pasta was seasoned by spices of every description—spices long used in the cuisines of ancient Persia and Arabia, Southeast Asia and China. The affluent Italian’s taste for sweetness and spice was heightened by Medieval trade links with the East and Arab occupations of southern Italy. So many old Italian court recipes seem influenced by the Middle East. Sweet spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, clove and ginger were accented by pepper, perfumed with rosewater, or their sweetness took on arid/herbal overtones from generous doses of saffron. These blends, in turn, were mixed into dishes with nuts, fruits, meats and cheeses</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">The ancestors of today’s filled pastas were stuffed with these combinations and then sprinkled with grated cheese, sugar, and cinnamon. On the religious calendar’s many meatless days, when one ate <span class="underline">magro,</span> or lean, pasta was cooked in milk or water. Broth of game or meat was the cooking medium on meat-eating, or fat <span class="underline">(grasso)</span> days. Those forerunners of present-day pastas evolved in remarkable settings. The Renaissance was a time of lavish banquets, a time when the foundations of modern cuisine were gradually taking shape in the noble kitchens of Italy. Her foods and manners were emulated, debated, and often envied throughout the Western world</span>.</p>
<a id="page186"/>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">A typical menu of the period had a minimum of three courses, each with five to twenty or more dishes. Basic banquet etiquette called for covering tables in silky linen and changing the tablecloths up to three times during a meal. Fashion dictated centerpieces of Greek gods romping through mythical settings, the sculptures carved from sugar paste, then gilded with sheets of gold and silver and painted in bright enamels. Each place setting was marked by napkins folded to resemble sailing ships, fanciful beasts, or flowers. Washing hands with scented waters between courses was accepted ritual. Music, short plays, and dancing supplied a change of pace between courses</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Sweet and savory flavors dominated dishes throughout the meal. Sugar was expensive, a status symbol, and used lavishly. Pasta had not yet taken its place as solely a first course. It appeared from first dishes to last</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">The first course always came from the credenza, or sideboard. Imagine a Welsh cupboard—like arrangement, a flat serving table backed by shelves. On those shelves your host displayed his best silver, gold, and pottery. Below, the tabletop was covered with a mosaic of room-temperature dishes arranged in perfect symmetry. Once the guests were ready, the entire collection of dishes was carried to the dining tables. There the multiple servings—green salads, bright fruits, cured meats, cold roasts, cheeses, marzipan, sweet tartlets, and perhaps pasta sprinkled with sugar, cheese, and cinnamon—were set out again in a symmetrical display</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">After the first course was carried away by servants, a second service came hot from the kitchen. Great pies covered with decorated crusts and filled with meats and/or pastas were paraded before the guests. Platters of hammered silver were mounded with roasts and stews, often nested into beds of filled or ribbon pasta. At an elaborate feast there would be two, three, four, and even five of these courses from the kitchen</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">The last course came again from the sideboard: vegetables dressed in vinegar and pepper, candied and fresh fruits, little cakes and pastries gilded with sugared seeds of melon or anise, savory tarts, fresh fennel to sweeten the breath, and perhaps squares of pasta filled with sugar, spices, fresh cheese and rosewater</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Descriptions of these feasts and foods of Emilia-Romagna are preserved in books and chronicles of the period. Four of them are <a id="page187"/>especially useful. Two were written in the region, the other two were created by cooks native to the region, but working elsewhere</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Christofaro di Messisbugo was the <span class="underline">scalco</span> or major duomo to the Cardinal Hippolito d’Este at the 16th-century court of Ferrara. His two books, <span class="underline">Banquets</span> <span class="underline">(Banchetti)</span> and <span class="underline">New Book</span> <span class="underline">(Libro Novo),</span> published in 1549 and 1552, record banquets, recipes and details of kitchens and pantries. One hundred years later Carlo Nascia was cooking for the Duke of Parma, Ranuccio II, and writing his <span class="underline">Four Banquets Destined for the Four Seasons of the Year</span> <span class="underline">(Li Quatro Banchetti Destinati per le Quatro Stagioni dell’Anno).</span> Nascia’s eye for detail is limited to the kitchen. Interestingly, there are few recipes for pasta. At about the same time Bartolomeo Stefani traveled from his native Bologna across the Po River to cook for the Gonzaga family, rulers of Mantua. His small book, <span class="underline">The Art of</span> <span class="underline">Cooking</span> <span class="underline">Well</span> <span class="underline">(L’Arte di Ben Cucinare),</span> was published in 1662 with not one pasta dish. Writing a few decades after Messisbugo, Bolognese Bartolomeo Scappi chronicled the banquets of nobles and churchmen. He cooked in Rome for Pope Pius V and wrote one of the period’s most complete and extensively illustrated cookbooks containing many pasta recipes</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">These records present pasta as court food, rather than food of the commoner. The white flour that produced the lightest pasta was the exclusive property of the wealthy. Today these sweet and savory recipes stand on their own as new and interesting pasta dishes. Certainly they speak of that glamorous era, but their exotic and unusual flavors fit very much into the world of the 20th century, where new tastes are embraced with such enthusiasm</span>.</p>

Using a wooden spatula, stir in about ¼ cup of the orange juice and the <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup sugar. Melt the sugar in the butter over medium heat, frequently stirring in more spoonfuls of orange juice to keep the sauce from crystallizing (reserve about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup for finishing the sauce).

<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Although the idea of pan-fried pasta was not new in Nascia’s time, it was nonexistent in Emilia-Romagna. Nascia was a Neapolitan. Then (as now) Naples had an omelette filled with leftover pasta. The vermicelli in this recipe suggests that he might have brought this dish with him from his home. Although vermicelli had become known throughout Italy by Nascia’s time (and was often a generic name for string pastas), they represent southern cooking rather than that of Parma in the north. The fact that no eggs are used in Nascia’s <span class="italic">torta</span> sets loose another thread of speculation. Pan-fried noodles—sometimes stuffed, sometimes not—are frequently made in China. Considering that China possessed a sophisticated pasta culture before Christ, pan-cooked noodle cakes might have been common for centuries before Nascia’s <span class="italic">torta</span>. Is it possible that Nascia heard of such a dish from the traders and travelers who crossed his path at the port of Naples, or in Parma’s court? Did he then reinterpret it to suit the tastes of his employers?</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Dough by Hand:</span> Stir the dry ingredients together in a large bowl. Using your fingertips, rub in the butter until the mixture looks like coarse meal with a few large shales of flour-coated butter still intact.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Make a well in the center and add the egg yolks and 1 tablespoon water. Beat the egg yolks and water with a fork until smooth. Then toss with the dry ingredients until everything is moistened. Do not stir or knead because the dough can toughen. Gather the dough into a ball. If it is too dry, sprinkle with the remaining tablespoon of water, toss for a few seconds, and then gather into a ball, wrap, and chill at least 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Dough in a Food Processor:</span> Put the dry ingredients and the lemon zest in a food processor fitted with the steel blade, and blend for a few seconds. Add the butter and process until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the egg and 1 tablespoon of the cold water, and process with the on/off pulse until the dough barely gathers into small clumps. Turn the dough out onto a sheet of plastic wrap, gather it into a ball, wrap, and chill at least 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Crust:</span> Sprinkle a work surface with flour. Thoroughly grease a 9-inch layer cake pan with removable bottom and 1¾-inch sides with the tablespoon of butter. Roll out the dough to form a large round about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch thick. Make sure the pastry is all of even thickness. Fit into the cake pan, bringing the dough up its sides and neatly trimming it around the pan’s rim. Because of its high sugar content, this pastry breaks easily. Just press it into the pan a piece at a time. Chill about 1 hour.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line the crust with foil and weight it with dried beans or rice. Bake 12 minutes. Then remove the liner and weights, prick the bottom of the crust with a fork, and bake another 8 to 10 minutes, or until it is barely beginning to color. Remove from the oven and allow to cool.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Filling:</span> Preheat the oven to 375°F. Have a 10-inch round of parchment paper handy. Bring the salted water to a vigorous boil. Drop in the pasta. Cook fresh pasta only about 10 seconds. Allow 1 minute for dried pasta. It should be tender enough to eat but still quite firm. Drain, rinse under cold water, and shake dry. Spread the pasta out on paper towels.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Coarsely chop one quarter of the almonds. Set aside. Combine the remaining almonds with the sugar and flour in a food processor, and grind to a powder (or use a hand-operated nut grater). Add 6 tablespoons of the melted butter, the almond extract, liqueur, water, and egg yolks to the food processor. Blend thoroughly. Turn into a large bowl. Beat the egg whites to form soft peaks. Lighten the almond mixture by stirring in a quarter of the whites. Then gently fold the rest of the whites in, blending thoroughly but keeping the mixture light. Slather half the filling over the bottom of the crust. Spread half the pasta over it. Then top with the remaining filling. <a id="page196"/>Sprinkle the reserved almonds over the filling, top with the rest of the pasta, and drizzle with the remaining melted butter.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Baking the Tart:</span> Lightly cover the tart with a round of parchment paper, and bake 20 minutes. Uncover and bake another 30 to 35 minutes, or until a knife inserted about 2 inches from the edge comes out clean. Cool the tart on a rack.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Serving:</span> Slip off the side of the pan, and serve at room temperature. Sift a generous dusting of powdered sugar over the tart just before presenting.</p>
<div class="bibliography"><p class="bibliographyEntry" style="text-indent: -5%;"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Suggestions</span></span> <span class="bold">Wine:</span> From Emilia-Romagna, a sweet white Bianco di Scandiano. From other parts of Italy, the Piedmont’s Caluso Passito or Malvasia delle Lipari from Sicily. Although heresy to Italian purists, France’s Château d’Yquem Sauternes complements the tart splendidly when fine Italian dessert wines are not available.</p>
</div>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Menu:</span> Serve after dishes from the Modena/Ferrara area, such as Balsamic Roast Chicken, Rabbit Dukes of Modena, Artusi’s Delight, Rabbit Roasted with Sweet Fennel, or Riccardo Rimondi’s Chicken Cacciatora. For a lighter menu, serve a main dish of tagliatelle with Meat Ragù with Marsala, Risotto of Baby Artichokes and Peas, or Risotto of Red Wine and Rosemary, then the tart.</p>
<div class="bibliography"><p class="bibliographyEntry" style="text-indent: -5%;"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Cook’s Notes</span></span> <span class="bold">Almond Extract:</span> Almond extract replaces the traditional bitter almonds, used for centuries to accent almond dishes. Bitter almonds, which can form harmful prussic acid, are banned in the United States. If available, the kernel found inside a peach or apricot pit can be toasted and ground with the almonds to attain a bitter almond flavor.</p>

<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">The Misunderstood Borgia</span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">The infamous Lucrezia Borgia is inseparable from the Sweet Tagliarini Tarts found in every Ferrara pastry shop. The Ferrarese speak of the woman as though she has just left the room. Affection for her has not diminished in the four and a half centuries since her death. Few believe she murdered her first two husbands. Everyone, from the lady waiting on you in the pastry shop to the town’s leading businessmen, explains how misunderstood she was, how her father and brother were the evil ones. Besides, even if some suspicion might have clouded her earlier marriage, once she settled down in Ferrara with her third husband, Alfonso d’Este, heir to the Este dukedom, all was well. As Duchess of Ferrara, she became a patroness of the arts, famous for her gentleness, beauty, and keen intelligence.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">In 1502, the about-to-be-married Lucrezia entered Ferrara with such a lavish show of wealth that even the Este, masters of appearing richer than they actually were, were impressed. Five years were needed to calculate the value of her dowry, which included whole towns as well as jewels, furnishings, artworks and gold. Ferrara lore claims that Sweet Tagliarini Tart was created by Este court cooks for Lucrezia’s wedding feast, its tangled topping of golden pasta strands a tribute to Lucrezia’s blond hair. Different versions of the tart are found in Modena and across the Po River in Mantua, which shared much with Ferrara during the centuries of Este rule.</p>
