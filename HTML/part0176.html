<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0001176">Tolosa is a town in the Basque country known for its beans, which are black and creamy when cooked. This dish is known as <em class="calibre9">alubia de Tolosa,</em> but it’s something that’s eaten throughout Spain.</p>
<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0001177">This bean and meat stew is a common thing to eat at the weekend, or when family are visiting – it’s a celebratory sort of meal. You eat the beans first, then the meat. It’s quite rich, so you need the pickled <em class="calibre9">piparras</em> to cut through the fattiness, and lots of red wine – and then a siesta afterwards …</p>
<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0001178">If you can’t find Tolosa beans, you can use good-quality white or black beans instead.</p>
<aside class="sidebar_wrapper">
<h5 class="serves">FOR 6</h5>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001179">500g dried Tolosa beans, soaked in water overnight</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001180">1 onion, peeled and cut in half</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001181">1 bay leaf</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001182">600g pork ribs</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001183">2 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into quarters</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001184">300g good-quality smoked pancetta, skin off (in one piece)</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001185">4 whole chorizo (around 100–120g each)</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001186">3 rice <em class="calibre9">morcilla</em> (or the best you can afford), about 150g each</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001187">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001188">pickled <em class="calibre9">piparras</em> or <em class="calibre9">guindilla</em> peppers, to serve</p>
</aside>
<div class="maincontent_wrapper">
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0001189">Drain the beans, then put them into a large pot or casserole dish with enough fresh water to cover them by one and a half times. This is important: you don’t want so much water that the beans will overcook. Throw in the onion, bay leaf and pork ribs, but don’t add any salt at this stage – it will make the skins separate from the beans.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0001190">Partially cover with the lid and cook on a medium heat, so it’s gently bubbling, for 20–25 minutes, then add the potatoes and pancetta.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0001191">Add the chorizo and <em class="calibre9">morcilla</em> 10–12 minutes before the end (any longer and the <em class="calibre9">morcilla</em> will break), with enough water to just cover.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0001192">Taste, and when the beans are soft, season.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0001193">To serve, everything must be hot (except the pickles). Discard the onion and bay leaf and transfer the potatoes, pork ribs, chorizo, pancetta and <em class="calibre9">morcilla</em> to a large plate. Put the <em class="calibre9">piparras</em> on a small plate. Slice the chorizo and <em class="calibre9">morcilla</em> into medallions and chop the pancetta into lardons. Serve everything in the middle of the table: the beans in their pot, the plate of meat and potatoes, and the pickles, with lots of bread to scoop up the juices.</p>
