<p class="noindent">When my father was a kid, in late August and early September his family would go to visit their relatives in Vermont and the entire extended family would venture out to the pine forests to gather wild mushrooms. As my father, Stan, recalls, “My task was to stay in a given place to receive and clean the treasures they found in the woods. We then placed them on large screens in the sun to air-dry.” They would prepare them as suggested in this recipe, and they also are great in <a class="nounder" href="ach99.html#page_194">Milanese Risotto</a>.</p>
<p class="indentb">These mushrooms make the perfect hors d’oeuvres to serve with drinks before dinner or as part of a buffet. The filling may be prepared and the mushrooms stuffed several hours in advance. Drizzle with the oil just before baking. Always make more of these than you think you may need, as they can be addictive. Though most children dislike mushrooms, they can’t seem to get enough of these. Watch them argue over the last one.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">10 ounces medium-size white mushrooms</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup plus 1 tablespoon olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">3</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup plain dried bread crumbs, or more as needed</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup finely grated pecorino Romano cheese</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic (about 2 small cloves)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon butter</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Preheat the oven to 375° F.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Remove the stems from the mushroom caps and set the caps aside. Finely chop half the mushroom stems (discard the other half). Warm 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and the butter in a small sauté pan set over medium heat. Add the mushroom stems and cook, stirring, until they have softened and are lightly browned, about 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_25"/><span class="red">3.</span> In a medium-size bowl, mix the cooked mushroom stems, bread crumbs, cheese, garlic, and parsley, and season with salt and pepper. Slowly stir in the remaining <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup olive oil to form a moist dough. (If the dough is too oily, add more bread crumbs.)</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Divide equally among the mushroom caps. Place the filled caps on a baking sheet. Drizzle the extra virgin olive oil over the mushrooms, and bake until the mushrooms are browned but still firm, about 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve warm. (If the tops of the mushrooms have not browned, place them under the broiler for 1 minute.)</p>
<p class="serves"><span class="smallcaps">— SERVES 6 —</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">WINE PAIRING</span>:</span> Sparkling, minerally white, and medium red</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATIONS</span>:</span> The chopped mushroom stems may be cooked in a microwave. Place them in a small dish and toss with the olive oil and melted butter. Cook on high power until firm but cooked through, about half a minute. Proceed with the recipe.</p>
<p class="noindenta">This same recipe may be prepared using large stuffing mushrooms. Chop one half of the mushroom stems and double the remaining filling ingredients. These mushrooms will take much longer to brown, about 12 minutes.</p>
