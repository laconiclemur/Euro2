<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0000072">We love to cook with squid ink in the Basque country. For us, the ink is the essence of the squid – much more intense than the actual body. The mess one little bag of ink can make is incredible … This is the kind of food I love: rich and full of flavour. You need bread with this, big time.</p>
<aside class="sidebar_wrapper">
<h5 class="serves">FOR 4–6</h5>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000073">300g dried chickpeas, soaked overnight (see <a href="part0108.html#sab0000087" class="pcalibre calibre3">method</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000074">2 bay leaves</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000075">1 onion (for the chickpeas), peeled and cut in half</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000076">500g squid or cuttlefish (ask your fishmonger to clean them and to keep the skin and ink)</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000077">75ml extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000080">3 cloves of garlic, finely sliced</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000081">2 onions, finely diced</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000082">1 red pepper, finely diced</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000083">1 green pepper, finely diced – or 16 Padrón peppers</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000084">150ml Txakoli (sparkling Basque wine), or sherry, or a crisp white wine</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000085">1 litre prawn stock (see <a href="part0218.html#pg288" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000086">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
</aside>
<div class="maincontent_wrapper">
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000087">Put the chickpeas into a large bowl (remember that they will double in size) and cover with plenty of hot water and an equal amount of sparkling water (this helps them to hydrate more quickly). The volume of water should be about four times the volume of the chickpeas. Leave to soak overnight.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000088">The next day, drain the chickpeas and put them into a pan with plenty of fresh cold water, the bay leaf and onion. Place on a medium heat and bring to the boil, then lower the heat and cook until soft – around 40 minutes.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000089">Cut the squid into rings, around one finger thick. Put the olive oil into a pan on a medium heat. When hot, fry the squid for a couple of minutes, then remove to a plate.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000090">Add the garlic and diced onions to the same pan – you want to caramelize them for about 20 minutes (turn the heat down a little if they start to colour too quickly). Turn the heat down to low and add the peppers – again, you want to cook them slowly until they collapse into a mushy paste. The slower and longer you cook everything for, the more flavourful it will be.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000091">Pour in the wine and stock, and add the cooked squid, its skin and ink. Then add the cooked chickpeas and season with salt and pepper. Continue to cook very gently until the sauce is thick.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000092">Serve in bowls, with bread for dipping.</p>
