<p class="author1"><span class="txit">risotto alla milanese</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In Italy they sell small paper packages of powdered saffron, but in the United States it is more typical to find saffron threads sold in small vials, which may be used to prepare this dish. It is traditional to serve <span class="txit">Risotto alla Milanese</span> with osso buco. It may also be served as a first course before chicken or other veal dishes.</p>
<p class="indentb">With the leftover risotto, make risotto cakes to serve for lunch on top of a green salad or for brunch with fried eggs. Just add an egg to the leftover risotto and enough bread crumbs to form a soft dough. Shape the risotto into patties about 3 inches in diameter and <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> inch thick. Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a sauté pan set over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot but not smoking, add the risotto cakes. Cook until warmed through and golden brown on both sides, about 8 minutes altogether. Serve immediately.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">8 cups hot chicken broth</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> teaspoon powdered saffron or 20 saffron threads</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 tablespoons butter</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup coarsely chopped onions</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cups Arborio rice</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup dry white wine</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup finely grated Parmesan cheese</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Measure out <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup of the hot broth, stir in the saffron, and set aside. Keep the remaining broth warm in a medium-size saucepan set over medium-low heat.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in the olive oil in a large saucepan set over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring, until they have softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add the rice and stir to coat with the butter, oil, and onions. Add the wine and cook, stirring continuously, until the wine evaporates, about 1 minute. Stir in the saffron broth and cook, allowing the rice to absorb it, about 2 minutes. Add the <a id="page_195"/>remaining broth, <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup at a time, stirring after each addition and allowing the rice to absorb the broth before adding more. Cook until the rice is tender but al dente, about 15 to 20 minutes. You may have broth left over. Remove from the burner and stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup of Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATION</span>:</span> Dried porcini mushrooms make a nice addition to this risotto. Soak 1 cup chopped dried porcini in 1 cup warm water. After the saffron broth has been added to the rice, strain the mushrooms through a fine-mesh sieve, reserving the liquid. Stir the mushrooms and the strained liquid into the risotto, allowing the rice to absorb the liquid before proceeding with the recipe.</p>
