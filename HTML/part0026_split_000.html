I was so impressed by her kindness and talent that I begged her to help me proofread this cookbook. She was lovely enough to say yes (it helps that she’s a foodie). You rock Jennifer! If you want to get in contact with her for any proofreading and editing, please send an email to 
<a href="mailto:jenthr@eartlink.net">jenthr@eartlink.net</a>.</p><p class="img">Thank you to my husband Joe for being wildly enthusiastic about everything I cook, even when it’s really bad. Thank you to David for missing your <em class="calibre7">maman’s</em> cooking while in college, and thank you Nathan, the skeptical eater in our family for trying a minuscule bit of that ‘weird chicken’ I made the other day. By the way, honey: it was fish!</p><div class="calibre11" id="calibre_pb_0"></div>
