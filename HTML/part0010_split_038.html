			<p class="notes-head">Artichoke</p>
			<p class="notes">To prepare an artichoke heart, take the artichoke and snap off the stem. Remove the outer leaves until you reach the soft yellow leaves. Cut off the top part of the artichoke where you see the slight indentation in these leaves, then trim off a little more to reveal the fibrous choke. Scoop out the choke with a teaspoon. Trim any dark leaves off the base of the artichoke, rub the cut surfaces with a cut lemon and leave it in a bowl of water and lemon juice while you prepare the rest.</p>
			<p class="notes-head">Blanch</p>
			<p class="notes">To blanch vegetables, plunge them into a pan of salted boiling water for a brief period, then drain and plunge into iced water. This stops the cooking process and retains the fresh colours of the vegetables.</p>
			<p class="notes-head">Bouquet garni</p>
			<p class="notes">A bouquet garni is a bundle of herbs for adding to soups, casseroles and other dishes. I vary contents to match the dish, but the classic version contains parsley stalks, bay leaf, thyme, celery and leek, all tied with string, or a piece of leek, to keep them together while cooking. </p>
			<p class="notes-head">braise</p>
			<p class="notes">To cook food, usually meat, slowly with some liquid in a covered pan. </p>
			<p class="notes-head">Confit</p>
			<p class="notes">The word confit comes from the French verb confire, which means to preserve. A confit is usually prepared by cooking meat such as duck, goose or pork in its own fat and storing it in fat.  You can buy confit duck and other preparations or make them yourself. Confit garlic and confit potatoes can be cooked in olive oil.</p>
			<p class="notes-head">Deglaze</p>
			<p class="notes">To deglaze a pan means to add stock, wine or other liquid to a hot frying pan or roasting tin in which food has been cooked, and then stir to loosen any sticky bits from the pan. This helps to maximise the flavour of the sauce or gravy. </p>
			<p class="notes-head">Flambé</p>
			<p class="notes">The process of adding alcohol to a dish and setting it alight to burn off the alcohol content.</p>
			<p class="notes-head">Julienne</p>
			<p class="notes">This is a term used in French cookery to describe the cutting of thin strips of vegetables such as carrots. Trim the carrot top and bottom. Cut a slice off one side to make a flat surface and place the carrot down on that surface. Cut another flat surface on one side, then cut the carrot into neat fine slices. Arrange these in a pile and cut them into thin strips, like matchsticks.</p>
			<p class="notes-head">Lobster</p>
			<p class="notes">A lobster can be killed by plunging a sharp knife through the head between the eyes. If you prefer a gentler method, put the lobster in the freezer for about 15 minutes. Don’t leave it for too long or the texture of the meat will be spoiled. </p>
			<p class="notes-head">New season garlic</p>
			<p class="notes">This is the fresh garlic, sometimes known as green or ‘wet’ garlic, available in spring. It has a milder, more gentle flavour than older bulbs. </p>
			<p class="notes-head">Piment d’Espelette</p>
			<p class="notes">This mild, smoky chilli pepper comes only from the village of Espelette in the Basque area of France. The chillies are dried and used whole or flaked, or ground into a powder. In 2000, it was classified as AOC (Appellation d’Origine Controlée), meaning that the name is protected and the chillies can be grown only in this area. It is available from specialist grocers and internet sites. You can use regular chilli powder instead but some kinds may be a little hotter than the Espelette variety so add with care.</p>
			<p class="notes-head">poach </p>
			<p class="notes">To cook food such as fish, eggs or meat very gently in simmering liquid. </p>
			<p class="notes-head">Reduce </p>
			<p class="notes">To reduce liquid such as stock or sauce, boil or simmer in an open pan so the liquid evaporates by the required amount, intensifying the flavour. </p>
			<p class="notes-head">Suprême</p>
			<p class="notes">This is a French term for a breast of chicken or other poultry. The breast is boned but may have the wing attached. </p>
			<p class="notes-head">Truffle</p>
			<p class="notes">A truffle is a kind of fungus, which grows around the roots of certain trees. They are expensive but have the most wonderful flavour. There are many different types, but my favourite is the black winter truffle (Tuber melanosporum). Black truffles can be cooked but are often eaten raw – just shave thin slices over a dish. </p>
			<p class="notes-head">Turning vegetables</p>
			<p class="notes">Turning root vegetables such as carrots and turnips makes for a neat, elegant presentation and ensures that they are the same size and so cook evenly. Peel the vegetables and cut them into chunks of about 5cm long. Carefully pare the sides of each piece to make a barrel shape that slightly tapers at each end. </p>
			<p class="notes-head">Ventrèche</p>
			<p class="notes">This meat comes from fatty pork belly and may be smoked or salted. If you can’t get ventrèche, pancetta or streaky bacon are good substitutes. </p>
			<p class="notes-head">Verjus</p>
			<p class="notes">This is a sour juice from unripe grapes and is not fermented. You can find verjus in good delis but if none is available, you can use light white wine instead. </p>
