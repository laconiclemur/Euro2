<p class="center"><em class="calibre7">Note: I had never made this recipe until I wrote this book. I wanted to include it but I think that at the time I wrote the novel I chose this recipe to symbolize a woman who is not afraid to take risks in the kitchen. Meanwhile, I myself had never taken that risk. I did not quite believe you could use this much salt and not ruin the fish. Now I realize how wrong I was to use this recipe to represent culinary audacity. This is the easiest recipe to make, and the fish comes out delicate, moist, and perfectly balanced, with just the right amount of saltiness.</em></p><div id="c12s01.01" class="calibre1"><p class="img"><span class="calibre30"><b class="calibre4">Poisson Croûte de Sel -- Salt Encrusted whole Fish</b></span></p><p class="center"><span class="calibre30"><b class="calibre4">Ingredients for four to six depending on size of fish</b></span></p><p class="calibre6"><span class="underline">Fish</span></p><p class="calibre6">1 2 to 3 lb. whole fish such as Sea Bass, White Fish, Blue Fish, or Salmon. The fish must be gutted but with the head and head still attached and the skin and scales on.</p><p class="calibre6">1 lb coarse salt for every 2 lb fish. The coarser the salt the better (which is why Guérande salt is better, but it’s too expensive in the U.S.) Fine salt risks seeping through the skin of the fish, so avoid it.</p><p class="calibre6">2 egg whites</p><p class="calibre6">½ cup water</p><p class="calibre6">A large baking sheet (long enough to accommodate the fish sideways), lined with parchment paper for easy clean up</p><p class="calibre6"><span class="underline">Sauce beurre blanc</span></p><p class="calibre6">1 stick of butter cut into cubes and at room temperature (extremely soft but not melted)</p><p class="calibre6">1 cup white wine</p><p class="calibre6">½ cup peeled and thinly minced shallots</p><p class="center1"><span class="calibre30"><b class="calibre4">Directions</b></span></p><p class="calibre6">1- Although serving a whole fish, skin, head and all can seem counterintuitive, the skin prevents the salt from seeping into the flesh of the fish, and the scales make it easier for the skin to come off with salt crust. The head and tail... just look cool. If the fish has already been scaled it’s fine. The salt crust will come off first and the skin will need to be removed separately.</p><p class="calibre6"><span class="underline">But do NOT attempt a salt crust on skinless fish</span>. I tested it for you and the result is inedible.</p><p class="calibre6">2- Pat the fish dry. If you wish you can stuff the cavity of the fish with a few slices of lemon, a sprig or two of dill, or other fresh herbs such as parsley, rosemary, or sage. I usually prefer not to stuff the cavity of fish to obtain a purer flavor.</p><p class="calibre6">3- in a large bowl, whisk together the salt, beaten egg whites, and about ⅓ cup water. The consistency should be that of the kind of coarse wet sand you can make sand castles with; easy to shape. If you want you can add a bit more water but not enough to dissolve the salt.</p><p class="calibre6">4- Place enough salt mixture on the baking sheet to cover the length of the fish minus the head and tail. Pack it tightly to about ¼ in. thick.</p><p class="calibre6">5- Place the fish on top of the salt bed.</p><p class="calibre6">6- Make sure the cavity of the fish does not get filled with salt as you mound salt around the fish. Then cover the fish with the remainder of the salt. Pack the salt on and around the fish in a coat about ¼ in. thick. Leave the tail and head out of the salt so people can recognize the fish as it comes out.</p><p class="calibre6">7- Place the tray in a 400°F oven. Cooking time will depend on the size of your fish. If you do not have a good <em class="calibre7">pifometre,</em> (French slang culinary instinct), it’s best to insert a meat thermometer in the thickest part of the fish (not through the cavity.) The fish is cooked when the thermometer indicates between 135°F. and 160°F. It usually takes 30 to 40 minutes.</p><p class="calibre6">8- While the fish cooks, prepare your <em class="calibre7">beurre blanc</em>. A <em class="calibre7">beurre blanc</em> (you do not pronounce the c in blanc) is a fabulous invention, a simple buttery sauce that complements fish beautifully. It can be flavored with lemon zest, lemon juice, capers, or dill or left as is (my preference for this recipe).</p><p class="calibre6">9- In a medium saucepan, pour the wine, and add the finely minced shallots. Cook until most of the liquid has gone, stirring toward the end until all that is left in the pan are the reduced shallots and a kind of thick glaze.</p><p class="calibre6">10- Remove from the heat and start adding the softened butter, one small bit at a time, whisking it constantly so that the butter is not melted but emulsified. Continue with the rest of the butter. If it becomes difficult to emulsify the butter, place it on very gentle heat for a moment, then continue away from the heat. Never let it melt.</p><p class="calibre6">11- Add salt and pepper to taste.</p><p class="calibre6">12- Stain the sauce (optional).</p><p class="calibre6">13- When it’s time to serve, I suggest you warm up your sauce serving dish by immersing it in hot water for a few minutes.</p><p class="calibre6">14- When the fish is cooked the salt crust will be slightly golden in places. Bring the fish on its baking tray to the table where it can be admired, and the crust can be broken in front of your guests, making you look like Mario Batali. The fish can actually stay there for as long as ten minutes before opening. Imagine the suspense! Break the crust by tapping on it a few times with a spoon. Peel the salt crust back. If the skin does not come out with the salt crust, peel it with two spoons (forks would break the skin.) Using the same spoon, remove the fish fillets, pulling them away from the spine first so that the ribs remain attached to the vertebra. Place the fillets on each plate, careful not to leave chunks of salt on the plate.</p><p class="calibre6">15- Drizzle delicious beurre blanc over each fillet.</p><p class="calibre6">16- Serve with steamed potatoes or pasta and maybe something green such as French string beans.</p></div></div></body></html>
