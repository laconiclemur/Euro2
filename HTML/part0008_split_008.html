			<p class="rec-intro">Also known as tarte au sucre, this is a delicious yeasty brioche-like tart covered in cream and sugar from the Bresse region of France (north of Lyon). There are many variations, including some with pink pralines, but this is the one that I like the most. Delicious on its own or with some fruit compote and best served warm.</p>

			<p class="ing-nu">10g fresh yeast</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">10ml warm milk</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">250g plain flour</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">50g caster sugar</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">5g salt</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">3 medium free-range eggs</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">80g unsalted butter, melted, plus extra for greasing</p>
			<p class="for-the">Topping</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 vanilla pod</p>

			<p class="body">Dissolve the yeast in the milk and place in the bowl of a food mixer. Add the flour, sugar, salt and eggs and knead with the dough hook attachment until you have an elastic dough. Add the melted butter and continue to work for at least 5 minutes, scraping down the mixture from the edges when necessary. Cover and leave to rise for 1 hour. Lightly butter a 20cm flan dish. </p>
			<p class="body">Knock back the dough to release the gases, then transfer it to the flan dish. Spread the dough out, then cover with cling film and leave to rise again – this time for just 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 220°C/Fan 200°C/Gas 7. </p>
			<p class="body">Place the tart in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Split the vanilla pod and scrape out the seeds, then mix them into the crème fraiche. Take the tart out of the oven and spread the crème fraiche over the top. Quickly sprinkle on the brown sugar and return the tart to the oven for a further 20 minutes or until fully cooked and brown on top.</p>
