<h3 class="h3b"><a id="page_111"/>summer pasta salad</h3>
<p class="author1"><span class="txit">insalata di pasta estiva della salute</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Serve this as a first course before grilled chicken or fish or as a main course for lunch. All of the vegetables except the tomatoes may be prepared one day in advance. Store in the refrigerator before tossing with the remaining ingredients.</p>
<p class="indentb">Here’s a trick I learned from Gianni: Do not rinse cooked pasta under cold water. This washes away the pasta’s natural starch and flavor and sauces will not adhere as well. Instead, drain the cooked pasta and toss it with a small amount of olive oil. Then spread it on baking sheets and allow it to cool completely.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 pound short-cut pasta, such as fusilli or penne</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 tablespoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> medium-size eggplant, peeled in intermittent strips and cut into <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>-inch cubes (about 3 cups)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 medium-size carrots, peeled</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 medium-size zucchini</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup fresh or frozen peas</span></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 <a class="nounder" href="ach10a.html#page_21">roasted yellow bell pepper, diced</a></span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cups finely diced tender celery hearts</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cups chopped ripe plum tomatoes (about 4 tomatoes)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup extra virgin olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">6 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub>-inch cubes</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta, following the package instructions, until al dente. Drain well. Toss the pasta with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and spread it out in a single layer on baking sheets to cool. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Warm the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet set over high heat. When the oil is hot but not smoking, add the eggplant and cook, tossing frequently, until <a id="page_112"/>golden brown and somewhat softened, about 6 minutes. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Fill a 3-quart saucepan with water, salt it, and bring to a boil. Add the carrots and boil to soften slightly, about 5 minutes. Add the zucchini and cook until the vegetables are tender but still firm, about 5 minutes. Add the peas and cook until just tender, about 1 minute. Drain the water from the pan and cover the vegetables with cold water, allowing the water to run for 2 to 3 minutes to cool the vegetables and arrest the cooking.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Cut the cooled carrots and zucchini in half lengthwise and then into <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">8</sub>-inch-thick slices. Place in a large serving bowl. Add the drained peas, the eggplant, and the roasted peppers, celery, and tomatoes. Add the basil, parsley, oregano, extra virgin olive oil, and cooked pasta. Toss well to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Gently mix in the mozzarella and serve.</p>
