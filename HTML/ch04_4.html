<h2 class="h2" id="ch04"><a id="page_110"/>SALADS<br/><span class="blue"><small>SO FRESH, SO GOOD</small></span></h2>
<p class="noindent">It’s odd that Spain, a country where vegetables and greens burst with flavor, hasn’t developed a serious salad tradition. I always ask friends why one so rarely sees <em>ensaladas</em> at traditional restaurants. They always respond that <a id="page_111"/>beautiful vegetables dressed with good olive oil are so common at home, nobody wants to pay for them when dining out. Clearly Spain isn’t the place for elaborately composed concoctions cloaked in fanciful vinaigrettes—you don’t even find these at creative modern restaurants. And unlike the United States with its filling lunch salads, France with its bracing bistro appetizer <em>salades,</em> or Italy with its custom of serving peppery greens at the end of a meal, Spain doesn’t really afford salad a fixed role at the table. The notion of a salad here tends to be improvisational. Just toss together <em>verduras</em> or greens, delicious diced boiled potatoes, and/or roasted peppers. Throw in some tuna, anchovies, or hard-cooked eggs, if you fancy. Dress with lots of aromatic oil and a flavorful <a id="page_112"/>vinegar. Then, enjoy at whim, as a snack, lunch, or tapa. I like this approach!</p>
<p class="indent">Where Spanish salads do come into their own is at tapas bars. First among tapa salads is the omnipresent <em>ensaladilla rusa,</em> or Russian salad, which combines diced cooked vegetables, tuna, and a creamy mayonnaise dressing. A good <em>ensaladilla</em>—such as the one in this chapter from Estrella de Plata in Barcelona—is a dish to behold. Another counter classic is the Andalusian <em>papas aliñas</em> (dressed potatoes), a simple salad that sings. Also ubiquitous and shockingly good are the juicy roasted red pepper concoctions (known as <em>zorongollo, asadillo,</em> or <em>mojete</em>), which sometimes contain tangy, fishy things like bacalao or salt-cured tuna. Here I offer two versions: one classic, the other creative, both sensational. And it’s worth mentioning the curious family of tomato-based chopped salads—<em>pipirrana, piriñaca,</em> or <em>trempó</em> in Mallorca—which are left to sit for a while to release juices. The result is an intriguing cross between a cold soup and a salad, related to gazpacho and perfect for dunking bread into.</p>
<p class="indent">One region in Spain that takes salads seriously is Catalonia, where you can sample such masterpieces as <em>xató</em> (curly greens with bacalao, anchovies, and <em>romesco</em> dressing) and <em>escalivada</em> (a scrumptious mélange of grilled vegetables), as well as leafy greens imaginatively paired with fruit and nuts. But even here, the maxim is: Keep it simple. Which is probably the highest respect one can pay to great greens and vegetables.</p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ENSALADILLA RUSA, ESTRELLA DE PLATA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">I’m not sure how the Russian potato salad (called Olivier in its native country) became a world staple, showing up as a part of a Korean appetizer spread, finding its way into the Turkish meze assortment, and becoming one of the most beloved tapas of Spain. But being Russian, I can testify that in Spain <em>ensaladilla rusa</em> is even more popular than it is in its homeland. Spain’s tastiest <em>ensaladilla,</em> hands down, is served at Estrella de Plata, a stylish tapas bar in Barceloneta, Barcelona’s old fisher-men’s quarter. Even my mother—who claims that <em>her</em> Russian salad is the world’s greatest—was sufficiently smitten to ask the chef, Dídac López, for the recipe. In addition to the cooked potatoes, carrots, and peas found in the Russian version, his features tuna and roasted red peppers, plus a wonderfully piquant touch of green olives and anchovies in the mayonnaise dressing. All the ingredients are partially mashed, so the texture is halfway between a salad and a spread (at Estrella de Plata it’s served with thin bread rusks). Bring the salad on a picnic, serve it as part of a tapas buffet, or just enjoy it as a light lunch with cold meat or cold cuts.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE SALAD:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 medium-size Yukon Gold potatoes, cut in half</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large carrot, cut in half crosswise</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small turnip, cut in half</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About 3 ounces green beans, trimmed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup cooked green peas</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 ounces imported solid oil-packed tuna, or 1 can (6 ounces) Bumble Bee tonno in olive oil, drained and flaked with a fork</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 roasted red bell peppers (see <a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#page_385">page 385</a>; from a jar is fine too), diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 hard-cooked eggs; 2 finely chopped, 1 grated</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE DRESSING:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>20 pimiento-stuffed green olives</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 to 7 best-quality oil-packed anchovy fillets, drained and chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup mayonnaise (preferably Hellmann’s), or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Make the salad: Place the potatoes, carrot, and turnip in a medium-size saucepan. Add water to cover by 2 inches, bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, partially covered, until all the vegetables feel tender when pierced with a skewer, about 15 minutes for the carrot and turnip, and a little longer for the potatoes. As the vegetables become soft, use a slotted spoon to transfer them to a bowl. Take care not to overcook. Bring the water back to a boil, add the green beans, and cook until tender, about 5 minutes (they should be neither al dente nor overcooked). Drain the beans, blot them dry with paper towels, and set aside. Let the vegetables cool to room temperature.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Peel the potatoes, carrot, and turnip, then cut them into small dice and transfer to a mixing bowl. <a id="page_114"/>Cut the green beans into ¾-inch lengths and add them to the bowl with the diced vegetables. Then add the peas, tuna, roasted peppers, and the 2 chopped eggs. Using a sturdy fork, mash the salad until it has a chunky-creamy consistency.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Make the dressing: Place the olives, anchovies, 2 tablespoons of the mayonnaise, and 3 tablespoons water in a blender and process until a medium-fine paste forms. Stir the olive mixture into the salad. Place the remaining mayonnaise and the lemon juice in a small bowl and whisk to mix, then stir into the salad. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. If you’d like the salad to be moister, add a little more mayonnaise. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the salad stand for about 2 hours. (You can make the salad up to 1 day ahead. Refrigerate it and let it come to room temperature before serving.) To serve, spoon the salad on a shallow serving dish and garnish it with the grated egg. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 8 TO 10 AS A TAPA, 4 TO 6 AS A SIDE DISH</strong></span></p>

<p class="box-title">ODE TO A CAN OF TUNA</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">One of the greatest meals of my life? Canned tuna—for real! It was summer and my friend and I were in San Sebastián, staying at the villa of our friend, the Michelin three-star chef Juan Mari Arzak. Arzak himself was off in Madrid, cooking for the wedding of Crown Prince Felipe, heir to the Spanish throne. Unable to face another haute restaurant meal, we decided to stay in for dinner and raid our host’s fridge. Well, the refrigerator of a world-famous chef looks like this: <em>empty,</em> save for a few forlorn cans of foie gras, Iranian caviar, and enough bottled water to put out a forest fire. But down in Arzak’s cellar amid dusty bottles of wine and pieces of old kitchen equipment, we discovered a treasure: a shelf lined with cans of piquillo peppers and tuna. We grabbed one of each, settled on a terrace overlooking the overgrown garden, and uncorked a bottle of Rioja <em>reserva.</em> The piquillo peppers were so ripe, red, and sweet it was like eating a perfect fall day. The tuna was more rich and buttery than any foie gras or <em>toro,</em> delicate but possessing the concentrated intensity of a confit. We ate in the twilight practically moaning with pleasure, periodically running down to the cellar to fetch more cans.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">When I told Arzak that his tuna was the best thing in the world, he exploded with laughter. “Hombre, por supuesto [man, of course],” he hooted, “do you realize what you ate?” The fish was <em>ventresca,</em> the exquisite belly section of the season’s first rod-caught tuna, packed in some unbelievable olive oil and canned especially for Arzak. (The peppers were of a similarly exalted quality.) “Sure, my tuna is the best meal in the world,” Arzak kept mumbling all day.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Arzak’s attachment to his tuna is nothing if not Spanish; only in Spain would a cutting-edge chef wax rhapsodic about something that comes in a <em>can.</em> This is because Spanish canned goods are so special. Even the average canned bonito one finds at supermarkets tends to be great, making our flavorless water-packed fish taste like cat food in comparison. And when you get to <em>ventresca,</em> this stuff is better than caviar (and costs about as much). The good news is that Spanish tuna is getting increasingly easy to find at American specialty food stores or by mail. Look for <em>bonito del norte</em> (literally Northern Beauty), which is a rich, moist albacore tuna from the Cantabrian sea. Good canned bonito is caught by rod, cleaned and filleted by hand, boiled, and canned in olive oil, a process that renders it silky and delicate. As for <em>ventresca,</em> if you see it, grab as many cans as you can afford. It just might be the best thing you’ll ever taste.</p>

<h3 class="h3o"><a id="page_115"/>ANDALUSIAN POTATO SALAD</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>PAPAS ALIÑAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">You’d be crazy to go to an Andalusian tapas bar and not order <em>papas aliñas</em> (marinated potatoes). These are shallow bowls of diced yellow potatoes tossed with sweet white onions, green peppers, and sometimes tomato and tuna, then generously bathed with good olive oil and sherry vinegar. Like many a classic tapa, it is a simple but fundamental dish on which a bar’s reputation depends. Bar Casablanca, a venerable Seville tapas counter, has my favorite version—and many <em>sevillanos</em> agree. The secret is the texture; the potatoes are slightly mashed rather than diced so they absorb the dressing better. Another secret is to use the best possible olive oil and be generous with it.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>3 medium-size Yukon Gold potatoes (1½ to 1¾ pounds total)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small sweet white onion, finely diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large Italian (frying) pepper, cored, seeded, and finely diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large vine-ripened tomato, peeled, seeded, and finely diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 to 4 tablespoons minced scallion</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 to 7 tablespoons sherry vinegar, preferably aged</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Minced fresh flat-leaf parsley, for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the potatoes in a medium-size saucepan, add enough cold water to cover them by 2 inches, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and cook the potatoes, partially covered, until they are completely tender when pricked with a skewer, 30 to 35 minutes. Drain the potatoes. When just cool enough to handle, peel the potatoes and cut them into very fine dice.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the diced potatoes and the onion, Italian pepper, tomato, scallion, ⅓ cup of the olive oil, and 6 tablespoons of the vinegar in a bowl and stir to mix. Season with salt to taste. Toss everything together, crushing the potatoes slightly, so that they are half mashed. Let the salad stand for about 2 hours to absorb the dressing. Taste and add more vinegar as necessary.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> To serve, spread the potato salad on a serving plate, sprinkle parsley on top, then drizzle the remaining oil over it. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 8 AS A TAPA</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3"><span class="green-1">MOLDED TUNA AND ROASTED PEPPER SALAD</span></h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>MILHOJAS DE ATUN Y PIMIENTOS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Salads of tuna, tomatoes, and roasted peppers are as abundant in Spain as tuna with mayo is in the United States. Of all the versions I’ve sampled—and there’ve been <em>lots</em>—this one stands out as the most scrumptious. It is a specialty at <a id="page_116"/>one of my favorite Madrid tapas bars, La Castela, in the upmarket residential area around Retiro Park. Every morsel at La Castela is fabulous, from the tostadas of Cabrales cheese and duck ham (<em>jamón de pato</em>) to the richly flavored braised beef cheeks. But this molded tuna masterpiece, layered with slightly sweetened tomatoes and dolled up with basil and black olive purees, is what I order again and again.</p>
<p class="indent">Serve it as a part of a tapas spread or as a luncheon salad with grilled country bread and have the recipe ready to hand out to guests. (They always ask!) The basil puree and the tomatoes can be prepared a day or even two ahead (the tomatoes need to sit about an hour). For molding the salad I use a pie plate, but you can experiment with a loaf pan or bowl, or make individual portions using ramekins or soufflé cups.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>5 tablespoons best-quality olive oil, plus more for brushing the peppers</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 pounds ripe red tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4½ teaspoons sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons sherry vinegar, preferably aged, or best-quality red wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 large roasted red bell peppers (<a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#page_385">page 385</a>), cut into thin strips</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons store-bought black olive paste (see <a class="nounder" href="ch04.html#ch04_note1">Note</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 ounces imported solid oil-packed tuna, or 2 cans (each 6 ounces) Bumble Bee tonno in olive oil, drained and flaked into chunks</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fresh Basil Oil (<a class="nounder" href="ch07.html#page_221">page 221</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring gently, until reduced slightly, 6 to 7 minutes. Stir in the sugar, and 2 tablespoons of the <a id="page_117"/>vinegar and season with salt to taste. Cook the tomatoes until the flavors blend, about 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the tomatoes to a sieve set over a bowl and let the liquid drain for a few minutes. Let the tomatoes cool completely.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Meanwhile, place the roasted peppers in a bowl and add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, the remaining 1 tablespoon vinegar, and a little salt and toss to mix. Let stand for about 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place the olive paste and the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil in a small bowl and whisk to mix.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Assemble the salad: Line a 9-inch pie plate with plastic wrap, leaving some overhanging in two places. Arrange half of the roasted peppers on the bottom of the pie plate, scatter half of the tuna on top, drizzle a little basil oil over it, and top with half of the tomato mixture. Top with layers of the remaining pepper strips, tuna, and tomato mixture, drizzling some of the basil oil very lightly over the layers. Place a large serving plate on top of the pie plate, invert it, and remove the pie plate and plastic wrap. Drizzle a little of the basil oil and the olive paste mixture over the top of the salad. Decoratively drizzle the remaining basil oil around the salad (you might not need all of it) and dot it with the remaining olive paste mixture. Serve the salad at once. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 8</strong></span></p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ENSALADA TIBIA DE BACALAO CON NARANJAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/p0117_01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="caption"><strong>Warm Salad of Cod and Oranges</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">This salad is another contribution to this book from the great Toledo chef Adolfo Muñoz. Lyrically Mediterranean and terrifically tasty, this is Adolfo’s sophisticated take on <em>remojón,</em> a traditional Andalusian salad of salt cod and oranges. In the states it is nearly impossible to find the fat loin of bacalao, which tastes even better than fresh cod when reconstituted, so I suggest you cure your own fresh cod in sea salt. It’s very easy to do but does take an hour, so plan ahead.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 pound center-cut skinless cod fillet</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 medium-size navel oranges</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 tablespoons fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 to 3 teaspoons fresh lemon juice (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 cups mesclun, rinsed and dried</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup small basil leaves</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ medium-size red onion, quartered and thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup minced red bell pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup minced green bell pepper</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the cod in a shallow bowl and pat salt all over it. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Peel the oranges with a small, sharp knife, removing all the bitter white pith. Working over a <a id="page_118"/>sieve set over a bowl, cut in between the membranes to release the orange sections into the sieve. Set aside the orange membranes. Let the orange sections drain.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Make the salad dressing: Squeeze the juice from the orange membranes into another bowl and add the juice that drained from the orange sections. Measure ¼ cup, and discard the rest or set aside for another use. Whisk 2 tablespoons of the olive oil into the orange juice and season the dressing generously with salt and black pepper. Taste the dressing and, if it seems too sweet, add lemon juice to taste.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Pat the cod dry with paper towels, taking care to remove any excess salt. Heat the remaining ¼ cup olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the cod and cook, turning once and shaking the pan, until the cod is just cooked through and starts to separate into large flakes, about 10 minutes. Transfer the cod to a plate.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Place the mesclun and basil leaves in a large bowl and toss with 2 tablespoons of the dressing. Divide the greens among serving plates and top with the orange sections and cod, separating the flakes slightly.

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ENSALADA DE PULPA CONFITADA CON PATATAS AL AZAFRAN</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">I love octopus every which way, but no dish has impressed me more than this one. I tasted it at Saüc, a Barcelona restaurant where a modest décor belies truly poetic and quietly ambitious modern Catalan cooking. The octopus was amazingly tender, paired with meltingly delicious saffron potatoes and dabbed with an intense tomato-onion reduction. The dish seemed simple, but when the chef, Xavier Franco, started explaining, I realized how much thought and technique had gone into it. Octopus can be rubbery even when boiled for a long time. The secret to a silky texture, Xavier explained, is cooking it very slowly, covered in olive oil. The result is a sort of confit. His potatoes were cooked in saffron oil twice at different temperatures. Dressing the salad was a Catalan <em>sofregit,</em> or <em>sofrito</em>—a mixture of tomatoes and onions—cooked for hours into an intensely flavorful jam. I’ve adapted the recipe to the home kitchen, but even with shortcuts it is still an exceptional salad. Try it warm or at room temperature, either as part of a tapas spread, as a first course, or even as a light main course. If you feel like tossing a few halved cherry tomatoes into the dish, go right ahead.</p>
<p class="uln1"><a id="page_119"/><strong>1 octopus (about 2 pounds; see <a class="nounder" href="ch04.html#ch04_note2">Note</a>), thawed if frozen</strong></p>

Drain, rinse under cold running water, and pat dry with paper towels. Place the octopus in a deep flameproof baking dish or ovenproof skillet that can hold it in a single snug layer. Scatter the garlic among the pieces of octopus and add enough olive oil to completely cover the octopus. Place the baking dish on the stove over low heat and bring the oil to a simmer. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake the octopus until extremely tender, 3½ to 4 hours. Let the octopus cool to warm. (The octopus can be prepared up to 3 days ahead and refrigerated, covered. Rewarm over low heat before serving.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place the potatoes in a saucepan that will hold them snugly. Add the chicken stock and enough cold water to cover the potatoes by 1½ inches. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.

Cover the saucepan and cook the potatoes over low heat until tender but not mushy, about 12 minutes. Drain the potatoes and cool to warm or to room temperature. (The saffron broth can be reserved for another use, such as cooking rice.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Place the arugula and extra-virgin olive oil in a mixing bowl and toss to mix. Season lightly with salt and pepper.</p>

Line a large serving platter with the arugula leaves or divide the arugula among dinner plates, if serving individual portions.

<p class="box-title">XATO-MANIA</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent"><em>Xató</em> is the Catalan answer to <em>salade niçoise:</em> a bold-flavored, refreshing mix of curly greens, olives, and salted fish. Popular in the winter months, <em>xató</em> is distinguished by its <em>romesco</em> dressing, a garlicky mortar-pounded mix of tomatoes, peppers, and nuts. (Make the recipe on the <a class="nounder" href="ch04.html#page_120a">previous page</a>, and you’ll understand why it has a cult following.) Everything about <em>xató</em> is just right: the perfect way in which the robust, puckery sauce clings to the delicate jagged greens; the briny layer of olives and anchovies; the substantial presence of tuna and bacalao. So popular is the salad in the wine-producing Penedès area south of Barcelona that it boasts its own fiesta, called <em>xatonada.</em> During the feast, normally held at carnival time, everyone in the hamlets and villages gathers on plazas around long wooden tables to consume thousands of portions of <em>xató,</em> accompanied by <em>cava</em> or Penedès red wine. The festivities usually culminate in a competition of Mestres Xatonaires, <em>xató</em> masters. In addition, this salad-mad area features a <em>xató</em> route, along which some one hundred restaurants offer their versions.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Traditionally <em>xató</em> is prepared with escarole, which is left to “wilt” for a while in the dressing, but frisée is also delicious. I’ve substituted whitefish or smoked salmon for the bacalao, since finding top-quality salt cod is difficult.</p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ESCAROLA A L’ALL CREMAT</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Vegetables or fish dressed with warm garlicky olive oil and topped with garlic chips can be found in many regions of Spain, from Andalusia to the Basque Country to Catalonia. The Catalans call these “burnt” garlic dishes, and they cook the garlic to a deep brown. This robust bistro-style salad was inspired by one served at Cal Pep, a lunch counter dearly loved by everyone in Barcelona. The proprietor, “Pep” Manubens, suggests including anything from sausage, to cold cuts such as <em>jamón,</em> to good-quality canned tuna in the salad. It’s also delicious with leftover roast chicken or turkey.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>5 tablespoons fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 ounces sweet Spanish-style chorizo sausage, sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>7 to 8 medium-size garlic cloves, thickly sliced</strong></p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ENSALADA DE ESCAROLA CON JAMON Y PERAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Whenever you come across a savory dish that includes pears, you can safely bet that the recipe is from Catalonia, perhaps from the <a id="page_124"/>Pyrenean Puigcerdá region, famous for its divinely delicious pears. This recipe is inspired by one from Can Ventura, a restaurant in an area that, due to a fluke of history, is within the French border but is governed by Spain. Its cuisine offers the best of the two cultures. Essentially a variation on the French bistro salad called <em>frisée aux lardons,</em> this smoky-sweet-tangy salad includes pancetta <em>lardons</em> (a stand-in for Catalan mountain bacon), caramelized with honey and vinegar, and pears that flavor both the salad and the vinaigrette. (Though not part of the original version, you can also add shavings of aged Manchego cheese or Parmesan to the mix.) Accompanied by Catalan Tomato Bread (<a class="nounder" href="ch06.html#page_165">page 165</a>), it makes a delicious first course served before any number of the Catalan dishes you’ll find in this book.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 piece (5 to 6 ounces) pancetta, diced medium-fine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4½ teaspoons honey</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons best-quality red wine vinegar, plus ¼ cup for the dressing</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 small ripe but firm pears, peeled, cored, and cut into ½-inch dice (see <a class="nounder" href="ch04.html#ch04_note4">Note</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>7 to 8 cups frisée (curly endive), rinsed, dried, and torn into bite-size pieces</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the pancetta in a small skillet over medium-high heat and cook until it begins to render its fat, about 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and continue cooking until the pancetta is lightly browned. If there is too much fat in the skillet, pour some off. Add the honey and 2 tablespoons of the vinegar, stirring until the honey dissolves. Cook until the vinegar evaporates and the pancetta is evenly coated with the honey mixture. Turn off the heat and let the pancetta cool a little.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place 3 to 4 tablespoons of the diced pear and the remaining ¼ cup vinegar in a blender and puree. Scrape the puree into a bowl and whisk in the olive oil. Season the dressing generously with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place the frisée in a bowl, add the caramelized pancetta and the remaining diced pears, and toss to mix. Stir in enough of the dressing to coat the frisée lightly (you may not need all of the dressing).

<h3 class="h3o">LENTIL SALAD WITH CHORIZO AND JAMON CRISPS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ENSALADA TIBIA DE LENTEJAS CON CRUJIENTE DE JAMON Y CHORIZO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Gutsy, smoky, and wonderful, this salad is substantial enough for a light main course and perfect for parties. The best lentils for the job are the green French du Puy lentils or the Spanish <a id="page_125"/>pardina lentils, but regular brown lentils are also delicious. The tomatoes add a fresh counterpoint to the salad, and for this dish I prefer peeling them raw with a vegetable peeler rather than blanching them first, which tends to make them mushy. Choose tomatoes that aren’t overly ripe. You’ll need a small cheesecloth bag to hold the onion, garlic, and herbs while the lentils cook.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 small onion</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 medium-size garlic cloves, peeled</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 fresh flat-leaf parsley sprigs, plus ¼ cup chopped parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 bay leaf</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup green or brown lentils (see <a class="nounder" href="ch04.html#ch04_note5">Note</a>), rinsed and picked over</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ pound sweet Spanish-style chorizo sausage, diced medium-fine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 ounces thinly sliced serrano ham or prosciutto</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons sherry vinegar, preferably aged</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon best-quality red wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon chicken stock or broth, or water</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon honey</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 medium-size firm tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup finely sliced scallions, both white and green parts</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the onion, garlic, parsley sprigs, and bay leaf in a double layer of cheesecloth and tie it shut.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the lentils in a medium-size saucepan and add enough cold water to cover them by 3 inches. Bring to a boil over high heat. Skim the foam off thoroughly, add the cheesecloth bag, and reduce the heat to low. Simmer until the lentils are tender, 15 to 18 minutes. Drain the lentils. (If you are making the lentils ahead, toss them with a little olive oil. They will keep for up to 2 days, covered, in the refrigerator. Let them come to room temperature before continuing with the recipe.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium-size skillet over medium-high heat.

<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Place 3 tablespoons olive oil, the sherry vinegar, red wine vinegar, chicken stock, and honey in a small microwave-safe bowl and stir to mix.

<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Place the drained lentils, chorizo, tomatoes, chopped parsley, scallions, and warm vinaigrette in a large bowl and toss to mix.

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_126"/>A SPANISH OLIVE OIL SAMPLER</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">No ingredient is more fundamental to Spanish cooking than olive oil, which ranges from an inexpensive, everyday fat for frying to pricey elixirs reverentially drizzled on langoustines or swirled into soups. Having supplied the Roman empire with the bulk of its oil in antiquity, Spain never looked back and today produces some whopping 50 percent of the world’s olive oil. Although most Spanish oil comes from the Andalusian provinces of Jaén and Córdoba, other regions, especially Catalonia, are playing catch-up with boutique products that can give Tuscany or Liguria a run for their olives. Generally, the dry Andalusian heat results in oils that are smooth, golden, and fruity, with just a hint of the peppery bite we associate with Tuscan oils. But with so much variety, it’s best not to generalize. Likewise, one should retire the notion that there’s such a thing as generic, all-purpose olive oil. Both chefs and home cooks these days choose their olive oil depending on how they plan to use it (frying, sautéing, drizzling, dressing a salad) and on the flavor they desire (fruity, peppery, smooth, astringent, delicate, robust). As I write this, I have some eight different Spanish olive oils arrayed on my kitchen counter: Each has its own nuance, texture, and color.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">The effect of a specific olive variety on the character of its oil is not unlike that of a particular grape on its wine. Spain boasts more than 260 olive cultivars, with a scope of flavors and fragrances that reflect the diversity of the country’s geography. Though it’s impossible to keep track of them all—especially since so many olive oils are blends of different varieties of olive—here’s an introduction to the best-known olives and their oils.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>ARBEQUINA From Catalonia and Aragon</strong></span> The suave oil from the small, delicate arbequina olives is herbaceous and fruity, with intimations of almonds and artichokes, and an attractive bitterness on the finish. It has a smooth texture, a heady fragrance, and a color that ranges from gold to muted green. Arbequina oils are young, fragile, and fresh tasting—not really suitable for cooking. Use them on salads, as a final touch for grilled fish or tender green vegetables, or for moistening toasted or grilled bread. The nutty, light-bright fruit is Catalonia’s best-loved table olive.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>CORNICABRA From Toledo and Ciudad Real in Castilla La Mancha</strong></span> The oil from these ancient horn-shaped olives—<em>cornicabra</em> means goat horn—is sweet-bitter-pungent, well balanced, and velvety textured, with a greenish-gold hue. Oil from riper cornicabra olives is reminiscent of avocado, with which it deliciously pairs. Use cornicabra oil straight from the bottle on gazpachos, in warm potato or bean salad, or for braised green vegetables, sautéed fish or chicken, or <em>escabeches.</em></p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>EMPELTRE From Bajo Aragon, Tarragona, and the Balearic Islands</strong></span> Light, mild, faintly sweet, and vividly fruity, this pale-golden oil has notes of apples and almonds and just a faint hint of pepper. Because of its sweetness, empeltre oil is great for blending with other varieties of olive oil. By itself, it’s delicious in salad dressings, in uncooked marinades, or drizzled over asparagus. Like arbequina, this oil is delicate and unstable. It’s best used raw (don’t cook in it) and stored in a cool dark place.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>HOJIBLANCA From Seville, Málaga, and Córdoba</strong></span> <em>Hojiblanca</em> olives have been around since antiquity, producing oils that can range rather widely in flavor but generally tend to be pleasantly bittersweet, fruity, <a id="page_127"/>and lightly peppery, with a note of almonds. As it can withstand chilling, this stable oil is perfect for gazpachos. It’s also good for frying and sautéing. And it’s terrific for baking—both sweet and savory. The plump, round fruit also shows up as a popular black table olive.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>PICUAL From the Andalusian provinces of Jaén, Córdoba, and Granada</strong></span> A high-yield variety, picuals comprise some 50 percent of all Spanish olives and are prized for their reliability and versatility. Picual oil is rather robust, peppery, fresh tasting, and pleasantly bitter. Because it’s so stable, this is an excellent cooking oil, whether you’re deep-frying, sautéing, braising vegetables, or cooking potatoes. It’s also delicious in vinaigrettes made with sherry vinegar. Picual oil is often blended with other varieties, such as hojiblanca.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><span class="blue"><strong>PICUDO From Córdoba, Jaén, Granada, and Málaga</strong></span> The pointed end of the fruit—<em>picudo</em> means prominent peak—accounts for the name of this olive, which generally makes a sweet, light, well-balanced oil with floral hints of apples and tropical fruit. Use it to drizzle on mild, delicate dishes, with buttery salad greens, and fruit gazpachos, and when baking sweets or frying fish.</p>

<p class="box-title">SHERRY VINEGAR</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent"><em>Vinagre de Jerez</em> is the aristocrat of the vinegar world. Vivid and well structured, with a penetrating, lasting astringency, it has the nutty notes characteristic of sherry and the complex bouquet of a fine wine. Sherry vinegar gives special vigor to salad dressings, makes awesome glazes and marinades, and lends an inimitable brightness to Andalusian gazpachos.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Like its mother wine, <em>vinagre de Jerez</em> comes from the Jerez region of Andalusia, specifically the sherry-producing centers of Jerez de la Frontera, Sanlúcar de Barrameda, and El Puerto de Santa María, a triangle of towns that today make up the DO (<em>Denominación de Origen</em>) of <em>vinagre de Jerez</em>. Sherry vinegar starts by injecting good-quality sherry wine with a bacteria that converts the alcohol into acetic acid. Once it begins to ferment, the vinegar undergoes the same solera aging process as the wine sherry: Younger vinegars are added to older ones, progressing through a series of stacked oak barrels filled with vinegars of various ages. American oak barrels, previously used for aging sherry, contribute character to the vinegar; the process of transferring it from barrel to barrel increases the oxygenation that imparts complexity and a dark amber color. <em>Reserva</em> (reserve) sherry vinegars are aged for at least two years, and it isn’t uncommon to find vinegars matured for up to thirty years. The longer the vinegar ages, the higher the acidity, but with a good vinegar high acidity means a taste that is concentrated rather than sour. Profoundly aged boutique sherry vinegars are becoming widely available in the United States, and for a fraction of what you’d pay for an old balsamic vinegar. (I mean the real <em>balsamico,</em> not a supermarket counterfeit.)</p>
<p class="sb-indent">At times sherry vinegar can be used interchangeably with red wine vinegar, but remember that it has a personality all its own. It’s sharper and more intense than the average wine vinegar, and not always right for dishes that call for, say, a lighter white wine vinegar. And don’t forget that Spanish vinegar production isn’t limited to <em>vinagre de Jerez</em>. Look for vinegars made from <em>cava</em> and the absolutely extraordinary chardonnay and cabernet vinegars called Forum, adored by contemporary Spanish chefs.</p>

<p class="noindent">Eating this dish in Catalonia, I always quietly gasp at how utterly magical plain grilled vegetables can taste. I had ascribed my gasps to the quality of the Catalan peppers, onions, and eggplants, but when I made <em>escalivada</em> at home, the magic remained. <em>Escalivada</em>—or <em>escalibada</em>—is from <em>escalivar,</em> or to cook in ashes, which is how the dish is traditionally prepared. Though today many Catalans roast the vegetables in a hot oven, to me this misses the point, as smokiness is an essential flavor component. In summer, the vegetables can be grilled on a grate until charred and soft or cooked whole directly in glowing coals, then peeled. When cooking indoors, I char the eggplants right on a gas burner and broil the rest of the vegetables while the eggplants cook. Torn into pieces and moistened with olive oil, the vegetables blend into a luscious savory marmalade, which can be served as a tapa, a relish with grilled meats, or a salad, perhaps topped with a few fat anchovies or a sprinkling of chopped black olives. <em>Escalivada</em> also makes a delicious topping for <em>coca</em> (Catalan pizza) or Catalan Tomato Bread (<a class="nounder" href="ch06.html#page_165">page 165</a>).</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 large very ripe red bell pepper, cut in half, cored, and seeded</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 medium-size firm but ripe tomatoes, each cut into 6 to 8 wedges</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size red onion, cut in half, each half cut into 5 or 6 wedges</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons fragrant extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing the vegetables</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 slender Asian eggplants (no longer than 6 to 7 inches)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size garlic clove, crushed with a garlic press</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4½ teaspoons best-quality red wine vinegar, or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Flaky sea salt, such as Maldon</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 to 2 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Preheat the broiler.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Flatten the red peppers slightly so that they lie flat and place them on a large, well-oiled broiler pan. Arrange the tomatoes, cut side up, and onion on the same pan and brush all the vegetables with olive oil. Broil the vegetables until they are soft and charred, about 15 minutes for the onion, a few minutes longer for the tomatoes and red peppers, transferring the vegetables to a platter as they finish cooking. When all the vegetables are done, place the peppers in a bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and let steam for 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> While the vegetables are broiling, place a small flameproof rack, such as the rack from a toaster oven, directly over a gas burner and set the heat to medium. Place the eggplants on the rack over the flame and cook until soft and charred all over, 7 to 8 minutes, turning often so they all cook evenly. (If the eggplants begin to leak, wipe off the area around the burners as soon as the eggplants are done. Keep an eye on the eggplants at all times, being aware of <a id="page_130"/>any stray sparks. Using tongs, transfer the eggplants to a plate and let cool enough to handle.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Peel the red peppers and tear them into strips. Peel the eggplants, remove and discard the stems, and tear the flesh into long strips. Decoratively arrange the eggplants, peppers, tomatoes, and onion wedges on a platter, alternating the various vegetables.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Place the 3 tablespoons olive oil, the garlic, and vinegar in a small bowl and whisk to mix. Pour the dressing over the vegetables, sprinkle with salt and parsley, and let stand for about 1 hour before serving. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4 TO 6</strong></span></p>

<p class="caption"><strong>Green Salad with Apricots and Hazelnuts</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Carmelitas restaurant is Barcelona’s favorite art-world haunt, overflowing at lunchtime with hipster <em>artistes,</em> gallerists sporting the latest fashion in eyewear, and sundry other bohemians. The menu is stylish, unpretentious, and impeccably tasty, and one of the perennial favorites is a salad that shows off the Catalan taste for dried fruit and nuts. This is my adaptation. The perfect greens for this salad are frisée, baby arugula, mâche, bite-size pieces of Belgian endive, and bits of radicchio. It is always better to create your own salad mixture, but in a pinch you can make do with store-bought mesclun. I like the apricots to be slightly chewy, but if you prefer, you can soak them in a warm sherry or a not-too-dry white wine. Use your best olive oil.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>½ cup finely slivered dried apricots, or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup hazelnuts, toasted (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_267">page 267</a>), skinned, and coarsely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>10 to 12 cups mesclun, rinsed and dried</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons best-quality red wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon fresh orange juice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon honey</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Set aside a couple of tablespoons of the apricots and hazelnuts for garnish. Place the remaining apricots and hazelnuts, and the mesclun, in a large salad bowl and gently toss to mix.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the vinegar, orange juice, and honey in a small bowl and whisk until the honey dissolves.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Carefully toss the salad with the olive oil until the leaves are evenly coated. Add the vinegar mixture and toss until evenly distributed. Season with salt and pepper to taste, sprinkle the reserved apricots and hazelnuts on top, and serve at once. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6</strong></span></p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ENSALADA CON HIGOS, CABRALES Y GRANADA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Pretty and fruity-tart, this salad is equally delicious as a first course or after a meal in lieu of a cheese course. You can use raw figs, but broiling them intensifies their flavor and adds an interesting smoky note. As a variation, try hazelnut or walnut oil in the dressing.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 medium-size pomegranate</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon honey</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4½ teaspoons fresh lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4½ teaspoons best-quality red wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons minced shallots</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>10 purple figs, trimmed and quartered lengthwise</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 to 10 cups loosely packed mesclun, rinsed and dried</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup toasted pine nuts (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_267">page 267</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 to 3 ounces Cabrales or other blue cheese, crumbled</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Cut the pomegranate into quarters. Remove the seeds from 3 pomegranate quarters and place them in a bowl, picking out and discarding any pieces of membrane. Working over a sieve, press the juice from the remaining pomegranate quarter into a second bowl. Whisk in the honey, lemon juice, vinegar, and shallots, then slowly whisk in the olive oil. Season the dressing generously with salt and pepper to taste and let stand while you prepare the figs.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Preheat the broiler.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Arrange the fig quarters, cut side up, on a broiler pan. Broil the figs until they look a little caramelized and lightly charred, about 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Place the broiled figs, pomegranate seeds, mesclun, and pine nuts in a bowl and gently toss to mix.

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ZORONGOLLO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Here is a dish I never tire of—sweet roasted bell peppers in a soupy marinade of chopped or grated tomatoes, vinegar, and good olive oil, perfect for dipping bread into. Enjoyed basically <a id="page_132"/>everywhere in Spain south of Madrid, the salad is called <em>zorongollo</em> and sometimes includes boiled potatoes, tuna, or bacalao. In Andalusia, it goes by the name of <em>pimientos aliñados</em> (dressed peppers) and is often featured as part of a tapas spread. By any name, it’s one of the world’s great basic dishes, wonderful as a tapa, a side dish salad, or a topping for grilled chicken or fish.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>4 large roasted ripe red bell peppers (see <a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#page_385">page 385</a>), cut into medium-size strips</strong></p>

<h3 class="h3o">GAZPACHO SALAD</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>COJONDONGO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">I had always wanted to find an authentic version of gazpacho in its preliquid form: a salad of tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, onion, and bread, dressed with vinegar, garlic, and olive oil. I had no luck in Andalusia, the birthplace of cold gazpacho, but in neighboring Extremadura—a region where the gazpachos are normally hot and feature game and where bread makes its way into almost every dish—I hit the jackpot. The salad, called <em>cojondongo,</em> which I encountered in an anonymous village tapas bar, was every bit as good as I had hoped for. It’s a cooling, nourishing peasant dish, <a id="page_133"/>traditionally made by shephards from provisions they carried with them to the pastures. The version I tasted also featured green grapes, since it is common in parts of Extremadura to add fruit to salads and other savory dishes. Though not entirely authentic, slivered mint or basil is delicious in this. To make the salad dressier and more modern, feel free to use different colors and types of heirloom tomatoes.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>2½ cups cubed day-old dense country bread (1-inch cubes)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size garlic cloves, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large pinch of coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small pinch of cumin seeds</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons sherry vinegar, preferably aged, or best-quality red wine vinegar, or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ pounds very ripe but firm tomatoes, cut into ¾-inch cubes</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 small Kirby (pickling) cucumbers, peeled and diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large Italian (frying) pepper, cored, seeded, and diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup finely chopped white onion</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup seedless green grapes, cut in half</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About½ cup slivered fresh mint or basil (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 350°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Arrange the bread cubes in a single layer on a large rimmed baking sheet and bake until they are just beginning to turn golden, 8 to 10 minutes, stirring once. Let the bread cubes cool.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place the garlic, salt, and cumin in a mortar and, using a pestle, mash them into a paste. Add the vinegar and olive oil and whisk to mix.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Place the toasted bread and the tomatoes, cucumbers, Italian pepper, onion, grapes, and mint, if using, in a large bowl and toss to mix. Add the dressing to the salad and toss to combine well.

<p class="box-title">SPANISH SALAD ANYONE?</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">I always hold my breath when ordering an <em>ensalada mixta</em> (mixed salad) in Spain. Even at respectable restaurants, I’ve been subjected to discolored iceberg lettuce tossed with canned peas, beets, and corn. At other times, though, especially in <em>vegetable-happy</em> Navarra, Rioja, or the Basque Country, the <em>ensaladas</em> were truly memorable mélanges of famously buttery Tudela lettuce hearts, boutique canned vegetables like white asparagus and piquillo peppers, and the much-prized canned tuna belly. These are the kinds of salads that I turn to at home again and again.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Spanish cooks tend to take the notion of <em>mixta</em> literally, blending raw and cooked vegetables and some form of protein—but keeping the dressing basic and on the side. Start with tender hearts of delicate lettuce, such as green leaf or Boston, and a few spears of endive, if you wish, and arrange them on a platter. Scatter quartered hard-cooked eggs and wedges of ripe, aromatic tomatoes on top. Then, decorate the salad with strips of piquillo peppers and good canned white asparagus, chunks of oil-packed tuna and/or anchovy fillets, or with strips of serrano ham instead of the fish. If you feel like tossing in some boiled green beans, artichoke hearts from a jar, or grated carrots, go right ahead. Sprinkled with sea salt and served with cruets of beautiful olive oil and aged red wine vinegar, <em>ensalada mixta</em> is one of the greatest simple lunches I know.</p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ENSALADA DE RUCULA Y ALCACHOFAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">The bar Nou Manolín in the seaside Mediterranean city of Alicante is a place I could happily settle into and never leave. A perfect <em>bar de producto</em> (an ingredient-driven dining bar), it specializes in seafood <em>a la plancha</em> and seasonal vegetables arrayed lavishly on the counter. Anything they prepare with artichokes—whether it’s crisp fritters with an accent of sea salt or artichokes braised slowly in aromatic oil—is outstanding. One day I fell for a simple, elegant salad of wild, bitter greens called <em>llitsons,</em> thinly sliced raw artichokes, and shaved raw porcini mushrooms accented with lemon and oil. While regular arugula—the smaller and younger the better—will work fine in place of <em>llitsons,</em> try seeking out wild arugula. Available at some farmers’ markets and specialty food stores, it has very small jagged leaves and an especially vivid peppery taste that’s similar to that of <em>llitsons.</em> Shaved fennel can also be added to the mix, though that’s more Italian than Spanish. And if you can get fresh porcini, well, <em>fenomenal!</em></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>4 large button mushrooms, wiped clean and stemmed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2½ tablespoons fresh lemon juice, plus more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 medium-size artichokes (about 1½ pounds total), pared down to the heart (see <a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#page_370">page 370</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 lemon, cut in half</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 to 4 tablespoons fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 small bunches wild arugula or very young arugula, stemmed, rinsed, and dried</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Using a mandoline or a vegetable peeler, slice the mushrooms paper-thin and toss them with 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice. Let marinate for about 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Rinse the artichoke hearts and pat them dry with paper towels. Using a mandoline, a vegetable peeler, or a very sharp knife, slice the artichokes paper-thin. As you work, rub the cut sides with a lemon half to keep the artichoke from discoloring. Toss the artichokes with the remaining lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and let marinate for about 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place the arugula in a salad bowl and season it with salt and pepper to taste. Toss the arugula with just enough of the remaining olive oil to lightly coat the leaves. Add the sliced mushrooms and artichokes and toss to mix. Taste the salad for seasoning, adding a little more lemon juice and salt and/or pepper as necessary. Serve the salad at once. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3o">FAVA BEAN SALAD WITH JAMON AND FRESH MINT</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>AMANIDA DE FAVES AMB MENTA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">In Italy, springtime fava bean salads are usually tossed with shaved Pecorino cheese. In Catalonia, the complementary ingredients are smoky-sweet slivered cured <em>jamón</em> and a bright accent of mint. Though the salad may sound traditional, it was <a id="page_135"/>actually “invented” by the legendary Catalan chef Josep Mercader and is now copied all over the region. If shelling and peeling fresh favas seems like too much of a chore, use shelled soybeans, which need no peeling.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>3 cups shelled fresh fava beans (about 3 pounds unshelled), or 3 cups shelled soybeans (edamame), thawed if frozen</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ cups shredded tender escarole or iceberg lettuce leaves</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 to 3 ounces thinly sliced serrano ham or prosciutto, torn into thin slivers</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup shredded fresh mint</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 large shallots, finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons sherry vinegar, preferably aged, or best-quality red wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</strong></p>
