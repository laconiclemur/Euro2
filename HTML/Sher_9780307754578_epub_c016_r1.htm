  <em>Prosit!</em></h1>

  <p class="center1"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L01_r1.jpg" /></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Gut Essen—good eating—is only half the German formula for good living; one should not forget its most important corollary, Gut Trinken—good drinking. Not that anyone could forget it while traveling through Germany. From the midmorning bread time (Brotzeit) to the midnight goulash soup or wurst, you are reminded by the much-repeated national toast, Prosit!<a id="fn5a"></a><a class="hlink" href="#fn5"><sup class="frac">*</sup></a> You hear it everywhere, in all the various classes and categories of restaurants: at the rough-and-ready street-side quick-snack stands; in the fine restaurants, in the Weinkeller, the Weinstube and the Weinhaus; in the Bierkeller, the Bierstube and the Brauhaus; in dining cars and theater lobbies and bars. It tells you that two or more convivial Germans are wishing each other well with a shot of fiery ginlike Schnaps; a great stein of cold, foamy beer; a green-stemmed, round-bowl Schoppen of fruity, aromatic golden wine or a bell-shaped glass of warming German brandy, Weinbrand.</p>

  <p class="footnote" id="fn5"><sup class="frac">*</sup> Pronounced more like Pros’t; rhymes with “post.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Beer is, of course, the beverage most closely associated with Germany and is as good a starting point as any. Although primarily a product of Bavaria, it is the “liquid bread” of all the land, from the Rhine to the Tyrolean Alps, from the North Sea to Lake Constance. Beerlike beverages were brewed as far back as Egyptian times, but beer as we know it was first produced in the Middle Ages by the monks (Mönche) of Munich’s Tegernsee monastery. From then on, that city was off and away toward becoming the beer capital of the world, a distinction it still holds. Munich also invented the Brauhaus, the <a id="page483"></a>brewery-operated restaurant that features simple, hearty, inexpensive food to go along with the real business at hand—beer drinking. This city abounds in these huge, raucous, lively halls and boasts Germany’s most famous: the Hofbräuhaus, where gray stoneware mugs with the bright blue initials HB are among the tourist’s favorite souvenirs; and the world’s largest beer hall, the Mathaser, run by the Löwenbräu brewery. Here some seven thousand people can be, and often are, seated at once and there are times when every one of them seems to be holding the identical stein of beer and singing the same currently popular um-pah-pah song. Certainly no beer festival can match Munich’s Oktoberfest, which runs for the last two weeks in September, a tradition since 1810, when it was begun as the celebration of a royal wedding. Now it celebrates the arrival of the first Märzenbier, the new beer brewed the previous March. Ten thousand people can be served in each of seven tents set up on the fairgrounds by the city’s leading breweries—seventy thousand people in all, each night for two weeks. The air sizzles with barbecuing chicken, fish and Bratwurst, and rings with the music of big brass bands and carnival screams, all ending in what must be the biggest municipal Katzenjammer (hangover) in the world.</p>

  <p class="indent">But beer is serious business here too and has been since 1487, when the dukes of Bavaria laid down the first purity laws requiring that beer be brewed only from barley, malt, hops, yeast and water. These laws are strictly adhered to today, not only in Bavaria but throughout Germany. For though Munich is the most famous beer city, it is not the only one. It shares honors with Hamburg, Bremen, Berlin, Dortmund, Kulmbach, Nürnberg, Würzburg and several others. Almost all of these beers are imported into this country, and the closer you live to a well-stocked German delicatessen, the better your chances of sampling them. When in Germany, it’s a good idea to try these special local brews on their home grounds, just as you would drink the vins du pays when traveling through France.</p>

  <p class="indent">Besides differing as to locale, German beers are divided into <em>helles</em> and <em>dunkles</em>, light and dark, called sometimes, in Bavaria, Schankbier (light) or Starkbier (stout). In addition, there is white beer, Weissbier, an alelike brew made of wheat. This beer is not aged, has a slightly sour tang and cannot travel, so is always consumed locally. It can usually be found in such large German sections as New York’s Yorkville. In Germany, the best-known Weissbier is that of Munich and Berlin. The first may be served plain or with a slice of lemon; the second is often served “mit Schuss”—with a generous dash of currant, raspberry or strawberry syrup. Because this beer is especially strong, it is served in especially enormous glasses, usually in the shape of a footless boot, or in a stein. Bock beer is a seasonal special available during the Lenten season. It is the new beer brewed the previous fall. A special white veal sausage, Bockwurst, is made and named for this beer and is served steamed, with hot mustard, big salty pretzels and white radishes, along with the bock beer.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page484"></a>Though some pilsner beer is brewed in Germany, none of it is exported. What we get, and what the Germans drink mostly, is lager, or “stored,” beer. This is a heavy, malty, bottom-fermented beer originally devised so it could withstand travel and thus be sold outside the brewmaster’s local area. To be at its best, German beer should be served at 45° Fahrenheit, just a little warmer than we usually drink our beer. It should be placed in the refrigerator 2 to 4 hours before serving time and should stand at room temperature for 15 minutes before it is opened and poured. If the beer is a little too warm, pour it into a cold, wet glass; otherwise pour it into a warm, dry glass.</p>

  <p class="indent">As for the glass itself, the most classic German types are so well known they are almost clichés. The ceramic steins, whether in the half-pint, pint or one-quart Masskrug, do add something to the flavor of the beer, and if you want to be absolutely authentic, you can buy some in German neighborhoods. The thick ceramic walls retain the temperature better than glass, and the handles are comfortable to hold. Otherwise, almost any glass will do as long as it is <em>not</em> a pilsner type. This is possibly the worst glass for beer, since it tapers in exactly the wrong direction. The perfect beer glass narrows toward the top in a sort of tulip shape, so that it holds the head. German glasses used in bars and restaurants always have the assay line an inch below the rim, indicating where the head should begin. To achieve the right amount of head (beer should have one or it looks and tastes dead), start pouring beer against the side of the glass. Halfway up, raise the bottle high and pour directly into the center to form the head.</p>

  <p class="indent">As you can see from the recipes scattered through this book, beer is a fairly important ingredient in cooking and is also whipped up in hot and cold soups and drinks. Egg in your beer or beer in your egg is often a reality in Germany. In addition, many northern German cities favor a special combination of a pint stein of beer taken as a chaser with one of the barley (Korn) or juniper gins, Schnaps. The Berlin Molle, the Hannover Lütje Lager, the Hamburg Lütt un Lütt and, in Lübeck, the Holstein beer with Korn are such boiler-maker combinations. One finds similar combinations in Amsterdam (gin and beer) and Copenhagen (akvavit and beer); evidentally the damp northern clime requires stronger spirits to chase the chills.</p>

  <p class="indent">If German beer has only the <em>helles</em> and the <em>dunkles</em> to confuse you, German wine has many more differences to worry you—fewer than the French perhaps, but much more than the Italian. However, since these are such absolutely delightful wines, it’s worth just a little extra trouble to learn about them. For all practical purposes, German wine is white wine, the few reds being unworthy of export or places of honor on fine restaurant menus. Although these whites come from three or four different sections of the country, they all have a related flavor and it is hard to mistake a German wine for anything else, unless it is Alsatian or Austrian. German wines can best be described as aromatic and fruity. Though this full-bodied <a id="page485"></a>flavor is most pronounced in Rhine wines, it is found in more delicate degrees in all the wines of that country.</p>

  <p class="indent">Properly selected, these wines are delightful with food, provided you serve them with those lighter German dishes that are free of vinegar. (Sauerbraten and most other such dishes belong with beer, not wine.) They are very pleasant sipped by themselves in a garden or on a terrace during a hot afternoon, and can also be used for punches. Like all white wines, they should be stored in a cool dry place and served well chilled. Whether you do this in a refrigerator or in an ice bucket, the wine should be served at between 50° and 55° Fahrenheit, though in Germany many prefer it close to 60°. Since German wine bottles have long necks and are filled right to the cork, turn them upside down for the last ten minutes of cooling time if you use an ice bucket; otherwise the wine in the bottleneck will not cool.</p>

  <p class="indent">You need have only one type of glass for German wines. It should be a stemmed goblet and should be held by the stem so the hand does not warm the wine. Ideally, the glass should be narrow, straight-sided and tapered toward the top in a sort of tulip shape to catch the bouquet. Rhine wine glasses, though beautiful, are not very practical to own, since the tall stems make them fragile and difficult to store and they are not really suited to the wines of the Moselle. If you want a special “German” wine glass, buy the Schoppen. It is available in all German neighborhoods and many department stores and is very decorative and practical. Actually, it is used in Germany for wine ordered by the glass rather than the bottle, “ein Schoppen” being comparable to a carafe in France. But they will be anything but “ordinaire” on your table, and with their green-roped stems and glint of gold trimming, are quite handsome.</p>

  <p class="indent">As a general guide, the Rhine wines are deep golden in color, very aromatic, fruity and slightly sweet, while Moselles are clear, light golden in color with a pronounced greenish cast. Their aroma is gentle and their flavor drier than the Rhines: if anything they might be called less “German”-tasting, the Rhines being the arch-types. AU Rhine wine comes in long-necked brown bottles; all Moselles in green, so that even if the label falls off you cannot go astray. Franconian wines come in fat round squat bottles.</p>

  <p class="indent">The best way to learn about wines is to drink them, not read about them, and being set adrift in a sea of wine terminology is only slightly less bewildering than to be put down in the midst of the Hampton Court maze. Still, a few pointers will be useful to start you off and I promise to keep it brief. For one thing, find a reliable wine dealer and let him guide you through the German vineyards, bottle by bottle. Jot down the names or keep the labels of those you like and just keep ordering them. The subject is clearly and explicitly covered in <em>Wine</em>, by Hugh Johnson, published by Simon and Schuster. Although this book deals with wines of many countries, its German section is complete, well-written and includes details on regions, labels and good years. <a id="page486"></a>Although more elaborate and expensive, the <em>World Atlas of Wine</em>, by the same author and publisher, offers additional facts as well as stunning and clarifying illustrations.</p>

  <p class="indent">Anyone who looks at a wine map of Germany will see that the vineyards are all pocketed off in the southwestern corner of the country, in that misty, balmy region nestled around the Rhine. All German wines are, in one sense, Rhine wines, but since no one would let you get off that easy, they have been further subdivided according to the part of the Rhineland and tributaries from which they come. Here are the main wine-growing areas, along with some of the most famous vineyard towns in each.</p>

  <p class="nonindent"><em>The Rheinhessen:</em> This is that section of Hesse that nestles around the Rhine, in a triangle between Bingen, Mainz and Worms. Its most famous Hochheim, the town that gave England its adjective “hockish” for all German Rhine wines, Martinsthal, Walluf, Eltville, Rauenthal, Kiedrich, Erbach, Hattenheim, Steinberg, Oestrich, Winkel, where the great glory is the Schloss Vollrads, Johannisberg, with its famed Schloss Johannisberg, and Geisenheim. The Rheingau, which is one long slope of vineyards, is also known as the Weingau and is one of the most picturesque sections of the country. Its wines are well suited to red roasts, cheese, lobsters and oysters.</p>

  <p class="nonindent"><em>The Rheinhesse:</em> This is that section of Hesse that nestles around the Rhine, in a triangle between Bingen, Mainz and Worms. Its most famous wine is the “Milk of the Blessed Virgin,” Liebfraumilch, a wine that can be superb but which too often means a blend of inferior qualities. Buy it only when it is on a shelf in the liquor store and sold at a respectable price; a bargain version sold from an open crate on the floor of the liquor store is certain to be inferior. The best bear the labels of Blue Nun, Hanns Christof, Crown of Crowns, Glockenspiel, Madrigal and Madonna. Hesse produces more export wines than any other section of Germany, and among the important towns of the region are Laubenheim, Bodenheim, and Nackenheim, agreed by experts to be one of the best towns, with such top vineyards as Gunderloch-Lange, Gunderloch-Usinger and Staatsweingut Nackenheim; Nierstein, another top town, with dozens of vineyards of which the four leaders are Schmitt, Heyl zu Herrnsheim, Senfter and Staatweingut Niersteiner. Oppenheim, Dienheim, Worms and Bingen are the other towns of this area. Rheinhessen wines are very good with poultry, cheese and white roasts such as lamb or veal.</p>

  <p class="nonindent"><em>The Rhenish Palatinate:</em> Almonds and chestnuts grow in this almost Mediterranean climate, just next door to France. Here along the hot southern border runs the German Wine Road, also known as the Pfalz or Rheinpfalz. It reaches from Kallstadt to Neustadt and its best vineyards are found in the towns of Bad Dürkheim, Wachenheim, Forst, Deidesheim, Ruppertsberg and Königsbach. Poultry with chestnuts, cheese or white meat are good with these wines.</p>

  <p class="nonindent"><em>The Central Rhine:</em> This is a secondary wine-growing area, reaching from Kaub and Bingen to Bonn. The wine is fairly good with oysters, lobsters, poultry and white meat.</p>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page487"></a><em>The Moselle-Saar-Ruwer:</em> Known collectively as Moselle wines, these are, in my opinion, the best German wines, and, in fact, the best white wines in the world. They are grown around the banks of the three rivers, the Moselle, the Saar, the Ruwer, and labels generally bear all three names. The most famous Moselle wine towns are Piesport, Bernkastel, Graach, Wehlen, Zeltingen, Erden, Brauneberg and Kesten. Along the Saar, the great vineyards are in Wiltingen, Oberemmel, Ayl and Ockfen, while along the Ruwer are Maximin Grünhaus, Eitelsbach and Kasel. In the district of Trier, halfway between the Ruwer and the Saar, Avelsbach produces some excellent wines too. Moselle wines are superb with fish or fowl and many connoisseurs consider them too good to drink except by themselves.</p>

  <p class="nonindent"><em>The Nahe:</em> This is a small wine section on a river tributary running just between the Moselle and the Rhine, from Bingen to Duchroth. The big growing and shipping center is Bad Kreuznach, where the wizard Dr. Faustus once taught. The wines are full of wizardry too and are said to be equally good with rare beef, fish, fowl and hors d’oeuvre.</p>

  <p class="nonindent"><em>Franconia:</em> This is the beautiful mountainous section of Germany close to the Romantic Road of medieval walled towns. Called Stein wines, Franconia wines come in fat round bottles known as the Bocksbeutel or Boxbeutel, the goat’s bladder. Most of Franconia’s wines come from the Main valley and are dry, earthy and less fruity than other German wines. Franconian wines were Goethe’s favorites and a few are available in this country. Some of the top vineyard towns in the region are Castell, Escherndorf, Frickenhausen, Homburg, Hörstein, Iphofen, Kleingenberg, Nordheim, Randersacker, Roedelsee, Schloss Saaleck, Veitschoechheim and Würzburg, where the true Stein type comes from.</p>

  <p class="nonindent"><em>Baden:</em> These wines are grown in the Swabian mountain slopes centered around Baden-Baden and Freiburg; not many of them are exported. They are very much like Alsatian wines in character. Fine Baden wines are shipped by Freiherr von Neveu, Graf Wolff-Metternich and Schloss Staufenberg.</p>

  <p class="nonindent"><em>Red Wines:</em> The red wines of the Ahr Valley, Ingelheim, Dürkheim and Assmannshäuser, can be enjoyed if you happen to be traveling through those sections in Germany; otherwise, forget the reds and stick to the whites. If you are serving meat that demands a red wine, do as the Germans do and buy a French wine.</p>

  <p class="extract">Before 1971 German wine labels had a dazzling number of demarcations denoting various aspects of quality, and although numerous, their meanings were clear, precise and easily remembered. In 1971 the change in German wine laws resulted in a labeling procedure far more confusing to all but students of German wines. There are still vintage wines, with good years such as 1966, 1967, 1969, 1973 and the exceptional 1971 always denoted. Other than that, the regrouping and consolidating of vineyards, although reducing them in number from 30,000 to 2,700, <a id="page488"></a>resulted in less precise designations. Regrouped into a larger unit known as a Grosslage (big vineyard), wine bearing a formerly respected vineyard name may now come merely from another vineyard in the area given the prominent vineyard’s name.</p>

  <p class="indent">The Weinbaugebiet (or, simply, Gebiet) is the largest land area designated, and refers simply to the main wine-growing regions described above—Moselle-Saar-Ruwer, Rhenish Palatinate, etc. The Bereich is a new subdivision, a district in the overall Gebiet. The Einzellage is the narrowest, most specific of geographical designations in the new law, as it refers to a single vineyard. The best German wines will declare an Einzellage location on their labels. The Grosslage is a name used by a grower who may blend two or more Einzellage wines. Obfuscation reigns here because there is no way to tell if the vineyard is a pure Einzellage wine from a single vineyard, or an Einzellage blend from a Grosslage. Since the law does not allow a label to contain a Grosslage designation, one can only hope an indignant wine-buying public will force this aspect of the confusing law to be changed.</p>

  <p class="indent">Besides regions, the most important standard for judging German wines is the Oeschle scale, or the percentage of sugar in proportion to the wine’s total volume. The more natural sugar (or strength), the better. In lesser-quality wines some sugar may be added to make up for nature’s lack.</p>

  <p class="indent">Tafelwein, or table wine, most of which is consumed in Germany, is the lowest level of quality. Sugar may be added to this; it may be blended not only with other German wines, but also with imported wine if that does not exceed 25 percent of its total volume. Tafelwein labels may or may not indicate a Grosslage district.</p>

  <p class="indent">Qualitätswein bestimmter Angaugebiete (more simply written as Q.b.A.) is a quality wine from a designated area but which has had sugar added to reach a minimum strength. This wine must pass a test for quality, and a test number appears on its label. It may also be Erzeugerabfüllung, or estate-bottled, and must come from a single winegrowing region.</p>

  <p class="indent">Qualitätswein mit Pradikat (Q.m.P.) denotes a quality wine with outstanding features, and is more simply called Prädikatswein. It is used to describe wines naturally sweet with no sugar added. It is the level of sugar that denotes a further delineation in quality of Prädikatswein.</p>

  <p class="indent">Kabinett (73 degrees Oeschle) is the minimal in this category.</p>

  <p class="indent">Spätlese (85 degrees Oeschle) refers to late-harvested grapes that have had time to develop a little more sugar.</p>

  <p class="indent">Auslese (95 degrees Oeschle) is a later, riper picking of selected bunches of grapes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Beeren auslese (125 degrees Oeschle) refers to selected grapes picked still later than the Auslese, and so, much riper.</p>

  <p class="indent">Trockenberrenauslese (150 degrees Oeschle) is made from grapes that have dried on the vine and which are, in effect, raisins. This results in a satiny, heavy, sweet wine, far more suited to desserts and after-dinner drinking than to table use.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page489"></a>There are other designations, of course, but those above are about as many as you need to make a reliable selection.</p>

  <p class="indent">Three special German wines are Sekt, or champagne, Eiswein and apple wine (Apfelwein). The first is a sparkling wine (Schaumwein), pleasant by itself and excellent in punches. It is not nearly as good as the French, since it is considerably sweeter, but it is much better than almost any we produce. Eiswein, or ice-wine, is superb, expensive and a real wine-drinking experience. It is a product of a few rare years when an early frost covers the vineyards and freezes the ripe grapes. The wine produced is sharp, crystal-clean in taste, with an edge the Germans call “steely.” Anyone interested in unusual wines should sample this. Apple wine is a specialty in Frankfurt and the surrounding regions and is rarely exported. If you plan to visit that city, be sure to spend at least one evening in an apple wine inn in the old Sachsenhausen section of the city. Here the mild white wine (something between hard cider and Rhine wine) is served in blue and gray stoneware pitchers. The inns are very gay and noisy with community singing, and simple food such as spit-roasted chicken, beef tartar and Cheese “with Music” are served. In winter the action takes place indoors, and you share long sawbuck tables with other guests; in summer the gayety moves outside to the garden.</p>

  <p class="indent">Remember that it takes a great deal of time and effort to produce good German wines and the demand for them far exceeds the supply. Therefore, they are expensive wines, with few bargains among them, so expect to get exactly what you pay for.</p>

  <p class="extract">Beer, wine and Schnaps make up the German drinking triumvirate, for the most part. All Schnaps is fiery, clear and white, very much like gin, akvavit or vodka. Those made of barley (Korn) or juniper, such as Steinhager, Schinkenhager, Doornkaat, Danziger Goldwasser, and Korn are usually taken before a meal, especially with ham, herring, smoked salmon or anything salty, oily or fat. They are also taken, as indicated previously, along with a beer as a between-meal pick-up or warmer. However, there are also a number of white liqueurs, also known as Schnaps, which are taken before, after or between meals. These are all delightful and are made from pears (Birnenschnaps), raspberries (Himbeergeist), plums or prunes (Zwetschgengeist or Pflaumenwasser), juniper (Wacholder), strawberries (Erdbeergeist) and the specialty of the Bavarian Alps, Enzian, a strong golden liqueur made of mountain gentians. I found all of these absolutely delightful and fortunately several brands of each are imported to this country. Birnenschnaps was especially good as a between-meal drink or dessert. Finally, the Germans produce a very acceptable brandy, called Weinbrand, or “burned (distilled) wine.” The best, Asbach-Uralt, made along the Rhine, is widely distributed in the United States and well worth trying.</p>

Add orange juice, lemon juice, tea and red wine to sugar and orange peel. Heat to boiling point, but do not boil. Add rum and serve in cups or toddy glasses.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. Tea can be omitted, in which case use only half the amounts of lemon juice, orange juice and peel.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. Two or 3 cloves and a small stick of cinnamon can be simmered with this punch.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Follow above recipe, substituting white wine for red. This also may be made with or without tea. The following two flaming wine bowls are both considered New Year’s Eve punches—Sylvesterpunsch. At midnight the lights are dimmed and the burning sugar flames blue as guests raise their cups and toast each other with the traditional “Prosit Neujahr”—a Happy New Year.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 bottles dry red or white wine</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 cup granulated sugar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 pound cube sugar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup dark rum or arrack, heated</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 bottle champagne (Sekt)</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Heat, but do not boil, the two bottles of wine. Pour into a heavy porcelain bowl. Add granulated sugar and stir until dissolved. Place a sieve or metal rack over the bowl. Heat rum or arrack and moisten cubes of sugar with <a id="page493"></a>it. Place sugar in sieve or on rack and set a match to it. As the sugar burns, slowly pour more rum or arrack over it to keep it burning. The sugar will melt down into the wine. Since this is a rather showy spectacle, it’s a good idea to perform it in full view of your guests. Add champagne after sugar has melted and serve in punch cups.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Originally, this punch took its name from the fire tongs that held the flaming loaf sugar over the bowl. You’re welcome to try the recipe that way if you like (if you can get loaf sugar), but be ready for a great and sudden splash. It’s a lot simpler and safer to use cubes of sugar in a sieve or on a rack.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Heat wine with sugar, cloves, orange peel and lemon slices. Do not boil. Pour into heavy porcelain punch bowl. Add juice of lemon and orange and stir gently. Soak sugar cubes in heated rum or arrack and place in strainer or on rack over punch. Set a match to the soaked sugar and as it flames, gradually pour more heated rum or arrack on to keep it burning. When sugar has all melted into punch, serve in punch cups.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2½ cups fresh strawberries</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 to 3 tablespoons sugar, or to taste</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>juice of ½ lemon</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 cups milk</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¾ cup heavy sweet cream, lightly whipped</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>fresh strawberries for garnish</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Wash strawberries well and rub through a sieve or purée in a blender. Add sugar and lemon juice and beat into purée. Gradually pour milk into fruit mixture, beating constantly with a rotary beater or a blender. The sweet cream should be whipped so that it is thick and foamy but should not stand in peaks. Beat half-whipped cream into fruit-milk mixture. Chill 1 to 2 hours, or until drink is ice-cold. Serve from a pitcher into 6-ounce glass tumblers or cups. Garnish each serving with a whole berry. This is very good as cold lunch or summer soup.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATION</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Frozen strawberries can be used for this, but they should be thawed thoroughly and well drained of excess liquid. One small package will do for this but use less sugar, as frozen berries are already sweetened.</p>
