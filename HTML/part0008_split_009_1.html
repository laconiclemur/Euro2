  <h3 class="h3a">Paccheri with rabbit sauce</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">Paccheri are a traditional Neapolitan pasta in the shape of large, round tubes, which marry very well with a thick sauce like this. The sauce can be made in advance and reheated thoroughly before adding the pasta. Rabbit is quite a bland meat so it needs to be livened up with spices or herbs: here I’ve inserted cloves into an onion, which gives the sauce a spicy taste. This is a simple one-pot meal that will give you two courses: the pasta is served with the sauce as a starter and the rabbit follows as a main course, perhaps served with a green salad.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 cloves</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 onion, peeled, left whole</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 carrot, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 garlic clove, left whole</p>

  <p class="ing1">½ red chilli, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 sage leaves</p>

  <p class="ing1">1kg/2lb 4oz rabbit, cut into chunks on the bone</p>

  <p class="ing1">750ml/1¼ pints/3 cups tomato passata (strained tomatoes)</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt</p>

  <p class="ing1">350g/12oz paccheri or lumaconi (large shells) pasta</p>

  <p class="ing2">grated pecorino (romano) cheese, to serve</p>

  <p class="para">Insert the cloves into the onion. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan on a medium–high heat, add the onion, carrot, garlic, chilli and sage leaves and stir-fry until golden. Remove and discard the garlic. Add the rabbit and brown on all sides. Stir in the passata and some salt, reduce the heat, cover with a lid and simmer gently for 2 hours.</p>

  <p class="para">Remove the rabbit pieces and set aside. Strain the sauce and put it back in the saucepan to keep it warm, together with the rabbit.</p>

  <p class="para1">Meanwhile, cook the paccheri in plenty of lightly salted boiling water until al dente. Drain, add to the sauce, mix well and serve with freshly grated pecorino cheese.</p>
