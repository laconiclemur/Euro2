  <em>Soup Garnishes and Dumplings</em></h1>

  <h1 class="subchapter" id="heading_id_2">(Einlagen, Klösschen, Klösse, Knödel, Klopse)</h1>

  <p class="center1"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L01_r1.jpg" /></p>

  <p class="nonindent">As though German soups aren’t interesting and varied enough in themselves, there are dozens of enticing little garnishes that have been devised to enhance them even further. Most of these Einlagen (lay-ins) are used with clear soups like chicken, beef, veal and vegetable broths; in a few cases, they are also added to the thicker meat and vegetable soups.</p>

  <p class="indent">One of the main categories of soup garnishes is Teigwaren, dough-wares, the noodles and noodle derivatives that are as popular throughout Germany as they are in their native Swabia. These include the raviolilike Maultaschen, the grated flecks of noodle dough, Reibele, and tiny Spätzle, most often served with meats and gravies.</p>

  <p class="indent">Dumplings comprise the single most important group of Einlagen, and, in addition, are also served as side dishes with meat, fish and vegetable entrees, in which case they become Beilagen—lay-bys. Dumplings are to the German cuisine what pasta is to the Italian, and, in the same way, vary in size, shape and texture, depending upon the food and flavors they must complement, and the liquid (soup, gravy or sauce) they must absorb <strong>Or</strong> carry. In many cases, the same dumplings used in soups are made in larger sizes to accompany the main course. Still others, like Königsberger Klopse, <em>are</em> the main course. A few, such as those at the end of this chapter, take fruit or sweet sauces and are served as desserts or with coffee, instead of cake. Dumplings should never be served with more than one course in any given meal; if you have them <a id="page55"></a>in soup, do not serve any kind of dumpling or “dough-ware” with the entree or dessert.</p>

  <p class="indent">Since most dumplings are made according to the same principles, I have grouped them all together in this chapter. Dumpling terminology can be pretty bewildering. Roughly, the main type is the Klösse or Knödel, two names that are completely interchangeable though the second is used primarily in southern Germany. A Klösschen is a small Kloss, and I have been told that anything called Klopse is made with meat, which seemed easy enough to grasp, until I remembered that a liver dumpling is always called a Leberknödel. Whatever you call them, most dumplings are composed basically of a starch (flour, semolina, potatoes, raw or cooked, bread or breadcrumbs), a liquid (water, milk or stock) and usually egg to bind the mass together. The egg may be added whole, or the yolk may be mixed in first, and later the whites, which have been beaten to a stiff snow, are folded in. This second method makes very light and airy dumplings. Some cooks like to sprinkle a teaspoonful or so of baking powder into the batter so the dumplings will rise and be light and spongy. Flavorings come by way of herbs, sautéed onions, spices, flecks of bacon or ham, bits of vegetables or vegetable purées. Dumplings are always cooked by steaming or boiling, in water, stock, soup or, occasionally, milk. A few are made of meat, fish or vegetables, and these are boiled, never fried or browned in any way.</p>

  <p class="indent">Dumplings can be tricky to make until you have some experience with them. It is almost impossible to give an exact recipe, as no one can know the amount of moisture in your flour or potatoes, the size of your eggs, the humidity in the air on the day you plan to make them, and a number of other such variables that will affect the batter. Once you are used to handling the dough, you will be able to tell when it is of the right consistency to produce perfect dumplings.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>GENERAL RULES FOR DUMPLING MAKING</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. Always make one test dumpling and cook it completely to be sure the batter is of the right consistency. If the dumpling is too soft, and falls apart, add more of your basic raw starch, or egg yolk. If it is too heavy and leaden, add more liquid, cooked ingredients such as mashed potatoes, or egg white. Cook your test dumpling before you shape the rest of your batter.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. Knead or mix dough thoroughly so that it becomes smooth enough to handle.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. Shape dumplings with wet hands, or between two spoons (teaspoons or tablespoons, depending on the size you want). Wet spoons by dipping into hot liquid in which dumplings will be cooked.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">4. Most dumplings should be cooked uncovered. Exceptions are those that must rise : those made with yeast or baking powder. These should be cooked covered. Cook dumplings uncovered unless the recipe says otherwise.</p>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page56"></a>5. Cooking liquid should be boiling when dumplings are dropped into it, but should be reduced to a simmer while they cook.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">6. A teaspoonful of potato flour can be added to the cooking water to help keep the dumplings intact. Never add the flour if you are cooking the dumplings in a soup that will be served with them, as it will be too thick, cloudy and starchy to eat.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">7. Remove dumplings from cooking liquid with a perforated spoon and drain them well in a colander before serving.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">8. Do not cook too many dumplings at one time. There must be room for all of them to rise to the surface of the cooking liquid.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">9. Dumplings used for soup garnishes should be about ½ to ⅓ the size of main-course dumplings.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">10. Dumplings should be cooked just before they are to be served. The batter can be made several hours ahead of time and refrigerated until cooking time. In that case, make your test dumpling just before cooking, so you can add more starch to compensate for any moisture that might have developed. The batter for raw potato dumplings must be prepared just before cooking, or it will turn black.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>OTHER SOUP GARNISHES</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. Croutons are easily made by cutting sliced bread into squares and toasting them on both sides in a skillet of hot butter.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. Cheese croutons are made in much the same way as plain croutons, but a little grated Cheddar or Parmesan cheese is sprinkled over them while they are still in the skillet after they have browned. Cook slowly until the cheese melts and coats both sides of the toast squares. For an even shorter cut to cheese croutons, simply use Cheddar cheese bread and toast as for plain croutons.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. Add diced or slivered chicken, meat or fish, depending on the kind of soup you are serving.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">4. Use minced fresh herbs: parsley, chives or dill, or combinations of these.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">5. Tiny cherry tomatoes often serve as the garnish for tomato soups. They may be used whole or cut in half, and should be added just before serving.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">6. Salted almonds, slivered or split, are delicious in cream soups.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">7. Add tiny shrimp or chopped shrimp to fish soups or cream of asparagus soup.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">8. Cooked rice is a favorite garnish in chicken and beef broth.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">9. Farina or semolina (Griess) is very popular in broths. To make Griessuppe, sauté 2 tablespoons farina in 1 tablespoonful butter until the cereal turns a bright golden color. Slowly add 1 quart of simmering beef or chicken broth and cook together for about 15 minutes, or until the cereal is done. Season with salt and a dash of nutmeg and pour in 1 well-beaten egg and let it cook up for a minute or two, as you would when making egg drop soup. Garnish with minced parsley or chives.</p>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page57"></a>10. A whole raw egg yolk is often served in beef or chicken broth. Put the yolk in the individual cup or bowl and ladle the hot soup over it.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">FOR 4 CUPS OF SOUP</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 egg</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1½ to 2 tablespoons flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>5 cups chicken or beef broth</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Beat egg with flour and a dash of salt. Pour through colander or through a perforated skimming spoon into a pot of simmering broth. Batter should be thin enough so that it seeps through holes of spoon or colander in a thin broken stream of droplets. You can speed the process a bit by stirring batter through colander with a wooden spoon. Let boil 3 to 5 minutes and serve, ladling egg flakes into individual cups or bowls along with soup. Sprinkle with parsley or chives before serving.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">FOR 4 SERVINGS OF SOUP</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 eggs</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons milk</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon finely minced parsley</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Beat eggs with milk, a dash of salt and minced parsley. Pour into a small buttered ceramic baking dish. Batter should be about <em>1½″</em> deep in baking dish. Cover baking dish with sheet of aluminum foil and set in large pan, half full of hot (not boiling) water. Simmer gently 20 to 25 minutes, or until custard is set and firm. Unmold custard onto flat plate. Cut into dice or thin strips and add to chicken or beef broth, or tomato soup, just before serving.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">A dash of nutmeg or 1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese can be added to egg-milk batter before it is cooked. 1 tablespoon tomato sauce or 1 tablespoon cooked minced spinach that has been thoroughly drained can be added to batter for color and flavor.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Although you can get very good egg noodles ready-made in packages, this homemade version is easy to prepare and far superior in texture and flavor, once you get the knack of handling the dough.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">FOR 4 SERVINGS OF SOUP</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 egg</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 to 1¼ cups flour</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Beat egg well with water and a dash or two of salt. Sift 1 cup flour onto floured pastry board and make a well in center. Pour beaten egg into well and gradually work in flour until dough holds together. If it remains sticky, add flour until smooth enough to handle. Knead dough 5 or 10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Rub a little flour onto your hands, shape dough lightly into a ball and let stand, uncovered, 10 minutes so that it will dry out. Cut dough into thirds, and with floured rolling pin, roll each section to tissue thinness.</p>

  <p class="indent">Place dough on clean cloth and let dry 20 minutes; roll, jelly-roll fashion, and cut crosswise slices of whatever width you want the noodles to be. They are generally very thin (about ⅛″ to ¼″) for soup, and about ½″ when used as a side dish or in puddings. Unroll slices, scatter them on clean cloth, and let dry 5 or 6 hours before you cook them. Once dry, noodles can be kept for weeks in a tightly covered jar. Boil in salted water 8 to 10 minutes, drain and add to chicken or beef broth just before serving.</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_6"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>GRATED NOODLES (Reibele)</em></h3>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">FOR 4 SERVINGS OF SOUP</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">To make these light and delectable egg droplets, prepare noodle dough as in above recipe. When you have shaped it into a ball, let dry 30 minutes and then grate downward on coarse side of cheese grater. Do grating directly over a clean cloth and move grater so that all the Reibele will not pile up on each other. There should be one thin layer dispersed evenly over cloth. Let dry 5 or 6 hours before cooking. Do not handle while wet or they will stick together and again form one solid mass of dough. Cook in boiling salt water 3 to 5 minutes, drain through a strainer and serve in chicken or beef broth.</p>

  <p class="indent">Reibele can be cooked in soup instead of water. Since the liquid must <a id="page59"></a>boil for dough to cook, the soup will become slightly cloudy. The first method is therefore preferable even though it requires an extra step.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">These delicious little meat-filled pockets of dough are a specialty of Swabia, and are first cousins to the Italian ravioli, the Jewish kreplach and the Chinese won-ton. Maultaschen means “mouth pockets”—pockets of dough that you pop into your mouth. In other parts of Germany they are known as Krapfen.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">FOR 4 TO 6 SERVINGS OF SOUP</span></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>Dough:</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 eggs</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 tablespoons water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 teaspoon salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 cups flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>Filling:</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 pound spinach (or 1 package frozen), cooked, finely chopped and thoroughly drained</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¾ to 1 cup minced cooked chicken, beef or pork</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 onion, grated</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 slices white bread with crust</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup milk or water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>nutmeg</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 eggs</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 egg yolk beaten with 1 teaspoon water</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Make dough. When you have rolled it into thin sheets, it is ready to be made into Maultaschen. It is not necessary for sheets to dry further. Cut into 3” squares with a knife, or into 3” circles with a scalloped cookie cutter or glass. Put a heaping teaspoonful of filling in center of each square or circle, moisten edges with egg yolk that has been beaten with water and fold in half to form pockets. Press edges together firmly and crimp with your fingers or with a fork. Let stand 2 hours before cooking. Boil 10 minutes in salted water as you would noodles. Drain and serve in chicken or beef broth, or with melted butter and toasted breadcrumbs as a side dish or entree. If you prefer, you can make Maultaschen a little smaller for soup.</p>

  <p class="indent">To make filling, mix spinach and chopped cooked meat together with grated onion. Soak bread slices in milk or water, squeeze dry after 3 to 4 minutes and crumble bread into meat-spinach mixture. Add salt, pepper and nutmeg to taste and mix in eggs. Knead or mix stuffing until thoroughly blended. Stuff Maultaschen as described above.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">MAKES ABOUT 4 CUPS</span> Spätzle, <span class="small">OR ABOUT 6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 ¼ cups flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 teaspoon salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 egg, well beaten</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¼ to ¾ cup water</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page188"></a>Sift flour and salt into a bowl. Add egg and mix. Add water gradually until batter is stiff but smooth. Press dough flat on a plate or floured board. With a sharp knife, scrape small pieces of dough off and drop into boiling salted water. There should be only one layer of Spätzle at a time in cooking water. Boil gently 5 to 8 minutes, or until you try a few and find them done. Remove from water with perforated spoon and drain. Spätzle may be served in pea, lentil or tomato soups, or as a side dish with meat or game. In the latter case, hot melted butter is usually poured over them just before serving. They may also be sautéed in butter until a bright golden color. Toasted breadcrumbs or grated Parmesan cheese may also be sprinkled over them.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">These julienne strips of golden egg crepes are also a feature of the Swabian kitchen.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">FOR 6 SERVINGS OF SOUP</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 egg</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 teaspoon minced parsley (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>butter for frying</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Sift flour into a mixing bowl. Beat egg with salt and water and pour into bowl with flour. Beat until batter is smooth, thin and absolutely free of lumps. Add parsley and stir through. Melt about 1 teaspoonful of butter in 8” skillet and when bubbling but not brown, pour in 2 tablespoons of egg batter. Tip and rotate pan so batter covers bottom in a thin even layer. Do this quickly, as batter will set almost as soon as poured. Let batter cook until golden brown on one side, turn over and brown on the other. Remove from pan and put on a rack or cloth to cool. Continue making crepes in this way until batter is used up, adding more butter as needed. Do not let pan get too hot. This amount of batter should make 5 or 6 thin 6” crepes. When crepes are cool enough to handle, roll each one tightly, jelly-roll fashion, and cut across <a id="page61"></a>into thin julienne slices. To serve, put Flädchen in soup plate or cup and ladle chicken or beef broth over them.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 egg</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons water or milk</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>corn oil or other vegetable fat for deep frying</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Sift flour with salt into a mixing bowl. Beat egg with water and add to flour. Beat thoroughly until mixture is smooth and free of lumps. Heat fat in automatic deep fryer or deep saucepan until it registers 375° on a fat thermometer. Drop batter in tiny balls (“peas”) from tip of teaspoon into hot fat. Do not fry all the batter at one time. “Peas” should float uncrowded in a single layer. In 1 or 2 minutes they will be golden brown. Remove from fat with perforated spoon and drain on paper toweling. Fry rest of the batter in same way. Serve on top of soup after it has been ladled into individual bowls or cups. These are good in chicken or beef broth, tomato or pea soup.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">These delicate dumplings are a specialty of the Swabian town Biberach, where they are served in a beef broth. This recipe is excellent for leftover roast veal.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">FOR 4 TO 6 SERVINGS OF SOUP, 8 TO IO DUMPLINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ pound ground veal, preferably roasted but raw will do</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salted water or meat stock</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>butter</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">If veal is roasted it simply needs to be finely ground and then mixed thoroughly with melted butter. If you are using raw ground meat, brown it well in butter. Mix meat and butter with milk, egg, salt, nutmeg, pepper, parsley and grated lemon rind. Gradually add cracker meal until meat mixture can be shaped into balls. Using two wet teaspoons, drop small meat balls into simmering salted water or meat stock. Simmer 5 minutes, turn off heat and let dumplings remain in hot cooking liquid 10 minutes. Remove with slotted spoon and drain thoroughly in a colander. These dumplings may be added to beef or chicken broth as they are, or, preferably, they may first be lightly browned on all sides in a little hot butter.</p>

Shape into tiny dumplings with wet hands or two teaspoons dipped in hot stock. Test one dumpling by cooking for about 15 minutes. Serve with Cream of Fish Soup, with creamed vegetables, or with mushroom sauce. If you serve with sauce as a main course, make fish balls twice the size.</p>

  <p class="footnote" id="fn3"><sup class="frac">*</sup> If you do not have fish stock, make a vegetable stock by cooking a stalk of celery, a carrot, an onion, a bay leaf, a slice of lemon, some salt and 6 peppercorns in 1 quart of water 15 minutes.

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 eggs</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Bring water to a boil and add butter. Cook slowly until butter has melted. Mix flour with a pinch of salt and put it, all at once, into butter-water mixture. Stir over low heat until dough forms a ball and leaves sides of pan. Remove from heat and cool slightly. Beat in eggs, one at a time, until well blended. Scoop off dumplings with wet teaspoon and drop into boiling salted water or soup stock. Cook about 10 minutes or until dumplings rise to top. Serve with chicken or beef broth, pea or tomato soup.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. To make tiny puffs for soup, put batter into pastry tube and squeeze them onto a buttered baking sheet. Bake in middle of 400° oven <a id="page65"></a>about 10 minutes, or until puffs are golden brown. Just before serving, top individual bowls of soup with these.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. This same dough can make another, lighter version of Fried “Peas”. Make batter and drop little bits of it, from tip of a teaspoon, into hot frying oil or fat.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. To make Cheese-Flavored Dumplings, substitute ½ cup milk for water, and stir in 1 tablespoon grated Cheddar or Gruyère before adding butter. When both cheese and butter have melted, add flour and proceed.</p>

Remove from water, open napkin and see if dumpling is cooked through. If not, tie it up again and continue cooking until it tests done. Unwrap dumpling and if finished, place on heated platter. Break into 6 portions with two forks; do not cut with a knife. Serve topped with hot melted butter and browned breadcrumbs, with any meat stew and its gravy. It is often served topped with a cooked mixture of about 6 or 8 peeled, quartered pears and 2 pounds string or wax beans, flavored with lemon rind, vinegar, pepper and sugar, and sprinkled with crumbled crisp bacon.

  <p class="indent2"><strong>NOTE</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Some cooks prefer to hang the dumpling instead of lowering it all the way into the pot. To do this, knot the napkin around a large wooden spoon, then hang the spoon across the top of the pot with the dumpling going into the boiling salted water.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Plum dumplings are extremely popular throughout Germany in the summertime, when little blue Italian plums are in season. They are served with coffee, or with meats as side dishes. To make them, stone each plum and put a small cube of sugar in center of each. Enclose each plum in a casing of dough and steam as you would regular dumplings. They will cook in 10 to 15 minutes. To make dough, follow the recipe for Noodles, for Thuringian Raw Potato Dumplings, or for Cottage Cheese Dumplings. Roll or press dough on floured board and cut in pieces to fit around a plum. Press edges closed and cook in salted water, then brown with breadcrumbs in hot butter. I prefer these made of noodle or cottage cheese dough, but the potato dough version is the standard in Bavaria, and very popular.</p>

Use recipe for Thuringian Raw Potato Dumplings, roll out dough to ¼” thickness, cut in squares and wrap each around an apricot that has had its pit replaced by a cube of sugar. Pinch dough closed around each apricot and simmer in lightly salted water 12 to 15 minutes. Drain when done. Toss gently in skillet with hot butter mixed with zwieback crumbs and a little sugar, until dumplings have a golden coating. Serve hot.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">These great dumpling clouds can be served as a main course or as a dessert. Translated literally, their name means steamed noodles, but they are dumplings nonetheless. They are also known as Yeast Dumplings (Hefeknödel) and are very popular with the farmers of south and southeastern Germany.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">4 TO 6 SERVINGS, 8 TO 12 DUMPLINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1½ tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon sugar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 teaspoon vanilla</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>strip of lemon rind</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Dissolve yeast in lukewarm water, sprinkle with 1 teaspoon sugar and let stand 10 minutes in warm room. Cream butter with more sugar and salt and gradually blend in eggs. Pour yeast into butter-egg mixture and stir a little. Gradually add flour and stir well until mixture is firm and forms a mass. Turn onto floured board and knead well. Put ball of kneaded dough in clean bowl, cover lightly with a cloth and place in a warm room, out of drafts. Let dough rise until it has doubled in bulk. This should take about 1 hour. Punch it down and turn onto a floured board. With lightly floured hands, shape dough into balls, about 1” in diameter, place in floured bowl, cover lightly with a cloth and let rise again ½ hour.</p>

  <p class="indent">To steam these dumplings, use a large heavy pot with tight-fitting lid, either a 12” skillet, a 5-quart Dutch oven or a covered roasting pan. In it pour all ingredients for cooking liquid. Place dumplings in pot so they are not too crowded, cover tightly and simmer over very low heat 30 minutes. Do not lift cover during that time, or steam will escape and dumplings will stop rising. Dumplings are done when <a id="page74"></a>liquid has all evaporated and you hear the sizzling of butter in pot. They are very good with meat and lots of gravy. They can also serve as the main course all by themselves, in which case a hole is made in top of each dumpling and in it is poured a little sauce of thick black prune jam melted in browned butter. When served as dessert following a meal that consisted of a hearty one-dish soup, Dampfnudeln are often served with either Fruit Sauce or Vanilla Sauce.</p>
