<p class="author1"><span class="txit">spaghetti e lenticchie</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This recipe was a staple at Nonna Tropiano’s home. She used tomatoes she had grown and bottled, along with items that she kept on hand in the pantry. The lentils for this recipe may be prepared one day in advance and then combined with the sauce.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup dried brown lentils, rinsed and picked over to remove stones</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> pound spaghetti, broken into 1- to 1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>-inch pieces</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups <a class="nounder" href="ach58.html#page_119">Joan’s Basic Tomato Sauce</a> or <a class="nounder" href="ach59.html#page_120">Sailor’s-Style Sauce</a> or your own favorite tomato sauce</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Place the lentils in a medium-size saucepan. Fill the pan with cold water to a level 1 inch above the lentils. Slowly bring to a simmer, and cook until the lentils are just tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti until al dente, following the package instructions. Reserve <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup of the cooking water before draining the pasta.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Meanwhile, drain the lentils and combine them with the tomato sauce in a saucepan large enough to hold the pasta. Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook until the lentils have blended with the sauce, about 10 minutes. Add the drained pasta, along with the reserved pasta water to make a liquid consistency. Season with pepper. Simmer the pasta and sauce together to allow the flavors to combine, about 3 minutes. Serve immediately.</p>
