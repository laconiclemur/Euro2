<div class="chapter_opener_text" id="div16">My home region of Asturias, in northern Spain, is a wonderfully undiscovered place. From the dramatic Costa Verde coastline to the towering Picos de Europa mountains, it’s a region of small towns and villages where people live not so differently from the way they did a century ago. In the rustic village of Naves, where my uncle Gelin lives, they keep chickens, roosters, cows, and horses in their backyards. They dry sheaves of corn, grow rows of vegetables, and store them in a <span class="italic">horreo</span>—an outbuilding that looks like a Japanese temple, raised on stilts to keep the food dry and safe from animals and bugs. Such buildings are almost sacred in Asturias, a reminder of how prized such dried foods are in Spanish culture.</div>
<div class="chapter_opener_text1" id="div17">None is more highly valued than <span class="italic">fabes</span>, the dried Asturian beans. In Naves you can still find elderly women who will sell you a bag of their special home-grown and home-dried <span class="italic">fabes</span>. Such beans are a world away from the dusty legumes you find in many supermarkets. Their thin skins are silky when dry and fabulously soft when cooked. In nearby towns such as Llanes, they even celebrate the <span class="italic">fabes</span> with a festival of traditional stews—restaurants serve multiple <span class="italic">fabadas</span>, showcasing the big, buttery white beans with chicken, chorizo, and lobster. Yet unlike stews elsewhere, it’s not the meat or the fish that’s the star; it’s the bean, which breaks up in the cooking process, giving the stew a thick, creamy texture that is unforgettable.</div>
<div class="chapter_opener_text1" id="div18"><span class="italic">Fabes</span> are just one variety of legumes that feature prominently in Spanish food, especially home cooking. One of my fondest memories of childhood is of returning home to the rich, warm smell of a garbanzo stew that my father was cooking. I would grab a plate and a spoon, climb onto a chair, and serve myself a big helping of garbanzo and chorizo. That family pot of stew, and its dense aroma, is something I love to re-create here in my own home in Washington. It’s the same for my wife, Tichi, who makes her family’s garbanzo and spinach stew—a recipe she learned from her mother, who in turn learned it from her own mother. Tichi likes to serve it with an egg on top or on the side, and it’s one of our daughters’ favorite meals. (Coming from the south of Spain, Tichi’s family cooking is heavily <a id="page75"/>influenced by Moorish culture, and garbanzos are one of the best legacies of those centuries of Arab life.)</div>
<div class="chapter_opener_text1" id="div19">Often overlooked here, legumes are an intimate part of Spanish home life, one of the universal foods that unite rich and poor. They are also an easy, affordable, and delicious way to create true Spanish classics in any American home—especially as American supermarkets are now selling authentic Spanish beans, already cooked and conserved in glass jars. Most of the recipes here require day-before soaking, but the jars and cans of ready-to-use beans and chickpeas are a good shortcut if you don’t have that much time.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div21">This was one of the first dishes my wife, Tichi, cooked for me, soon after we were married. It was also the cause for the most expensive telephone call we ever made, since she talked to her mother through the entire cooking process. The result was worth every penny. Now it’s one of our Sunday specials—especially through the winter months.</div>
<div class="yield" id="div22"><span class="brown"><span class="bold">Serves 4</span></span></div>
<div class="ingredients" id="div23">
<div class="IL_item_top" id="div24">9 ounces dried garbanzos (chickpeas)</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div25">1 pinch of baking soda</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div26">¼ cup Spanish extra-virgin olive oil</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div27">6 garlic cloves, peeled</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div28">2 ounces sliced white bread, crusts removed</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div29">2 tablespoons <span class="italic">pimentón</span> (Spanish sweet paprika)</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div30">1 pinch Spanish saffron threads</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div31">2 tablespoons Spanish sherry vinegar</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div32">½ pound spinach, washed</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div33">1 teaspoon ground cumin</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div34">Salt to taste</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div35">White pepper to taste</div>
</div>
<div class="method" id="div36">The day before you plan to cook the stew, place the chickpeas in a bowl and cover with cold water. Add the baking soda, stir, and set aside to soak overnight. The next day, drain and rinse the chickpeas.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div37">In a big saucepan, combine the chickpeas with 2½ quarts of water. Bring to a boil. Then reduce the heat to low and simmer until the chickpeas are tender, about 2 hours. Every 10 minutes or so, add ¼ cup of cold water to slow down the simmering. By the end, the water should have reduced so it is barely covering the chickpeas. Turn off the heat and let the chickpeas sit in the water.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div38">Heat the olive oil in a small sauté pan over a medium-low flame. Add the garlic and cook until it is browned, about 3 minutes. Remove the garlic from the pan and set it aside. Add the bread to the pan and brown it on both sides, about 1 minute each side. Remove the bread and set it aside.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div39">Remove the pan from the heat and allow it to cool for a few minutes. Add the <span class="italic">pimentón</span> and saffron to the pan, and then immediately add the sherry vinegar to prevent the <span class="italic">pimentón</span> from burning. Leave the pan off the heat.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div40">In a mortar, smash the reserved garlic and the toasted bread to make a very thick paste.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div41">Bring the chickpeas back to a low boil (see José’s tips) and add the spinach. Simmer for 5 minutes. Add the <span class="italic">pimentón</span> mixture along with the garlic paste. You should have a thick, stewy sauce. Simmer for another 5 minutes. Season with salt and white pepper to taste, and serve immediately.</div>

<div class="tip_brown" id="c05-tip1">
<div class="tip_header" id="div42">José’s tips</div>
<div class="tip_text" id="div43">When the chickpeas are cooked and soft, you should have only around one finger’s depth (½ inch) of water left in the bottom of the pan. If there is more, remove some water from the pan before adding the rest of the ingredients.</div>
<div class="tip_text1" id="div44">If you don’t have time to cook for 2 or 3 hours, use 3 cups good-quality chickpeas from a can or jar. Just add some extra water before you cook the spinach, in case there isn’t enough in the jar.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div46">Asturias, my home region, has some of the best beans you’ll ever find—big and buttery, with thin skins—traditionally served with clams. The combination of the fresh texture of the clams with the creamy smoothness of the beans is just heavenly. It takes me right back to the Sunday lunches of my childhood with my Aunt Chita.</div>

<div class="method1" id="div59">Combine the beans and the mineral water in a large stockpot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes, occasionally removing the foam on the surface. Then add the onion, tomato, carrot, and parsley, and simmer for 2 hours. Every 10 or 15 minutes, add ¼ cup of cold water to slow the simmering. Be sure the beans are always covered with liquid. By the end of the 2 hours, you should be left with 3 cups of water—enough to barely cover the beans.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div60">Remove the vegetables and place them in a bowl or in a food processor. With a spoon, pick out ½ cup of beans that are split or broken. Add them to the vegetables along with 1 tablespoon of the cooking water. Blend together using a hand blender or food processor. Pass the mixture through a fine strainer, and return it to the beans in the stockpot. Add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and season with salt. You should have very soft beans in a creamy, starchy broth. Bring to a simmer again. Bring 1 quart of water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Put 4 clams in the vigorously boiling water and cook until they open a fraction, just 5 seconds. Remove them from the water. Repeat with the remaining clams. With a paring knife, and holding the clams over a bowl, remove the clams from their shells, reserving the juices in the bowl. Set the clams aside. Strain the juices and add to the beans.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div61">Place a ladleful of beans in the center of each soup dish, and arrange the clams on top. Drizzle the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil over the clams, and serve.</div>

<div class="tip_text1" id="div64">Pay attention when you place the clams in the boiling water. You’re really just shocking them in the hot water for a few seconds, rather than cooking them. They’ll continue cooking on top of the beans.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div66">When I visit my mother’s family in my hometown of Mieres, there’s nothing better at a big reunion than a huge bowl of <span class="italic">fabada</span>. This is not traditionally a tapa. Indeed, the way they serve it in Mieres, it’s the opposite—it’s a big, hearty plate, a dish from another era, when the menfolk worked long hours in the mines and the <span class="italic">fabada</span> was the perfect way to replenish at the end of the day. For me, it’s also my favorite New Year’s dish: the best comfort food. I wake up early and by 2:00 in the afternoon, we are ready to sit around the big stew.
