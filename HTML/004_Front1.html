  A Little Taste of What Is to Follow</p>

  <p class="noindent">Politics and cuisine?</p>

  <p class="noindent">While this might seem an unlikely combination at first glance, the two share singular affinities.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Ambassadors of their departments, French deputies represent their constituents at the Palais Bourbon, home of the National Assembly—the forum where France conducts its politics. Beyond the political aspect of their role, however, these deputies all enjoy good cuisine, and have agreed to share and exhibit with pride a sample of the gastronomy of their particular land—<span class="italic">le terroir</span>. Each recipe, each dish is made with the prized products, meat and sea fare, identified with their district.</p>

  <p class="noindent">This book is the personal mirror of various culinary traditions born in the course of a long history, passed down through the generations. Today each traditional cuisine, while retaining its authenticity, has traveled beyond its original borders and can be enjoyed throughout all of France—and the world.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Like the scope of their politics, the various regional cuisines presented in this book can be modest or grand, innovative or orthodox, stimulating or soothing. The one basic common denominator is the quality of the products and ingredients assembled for each preparation. Combining flavors is the second act that will determine whether a magical dish appears on the table.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Every five years, deputies in France stand for election, in a sort of grand electoral cook-off. Candidates may get roasted, skewered, raked over the coals, stewed in their own juices, or grilled by their constituents, but at the end of day all are in the same position, presented on the same platter. Both crusty veterans and young sprouts are subject to the electorate’s scrutiny, and only the candidates best able to respond to the issues of the moment will get the thumbs-up and avoid the compost heap.</p>

  <p class="noindent">In <span class="italic">French Country Cooking: Authentic Recipes from Every Region</span>, for the first time, deputies representing every department of metropolitan France, including our overseas territories, have contributed to a collective cookbook offering savory and sweet, time-tested and timeless dishes.</p>

  <p class="noindent">It is with great pleasure that I invite you to share the panoply of gourmand moments with us. You will discover never-published recipes, and will even be surprised by some new combinations of flavors.</p>

  <p class="noindent">My hope is that reading this book will inspire your own creativity, as well as ignite your curiosity to explore our rich and multifaceted country.</p>
