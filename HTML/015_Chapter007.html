  <p class="h1">Fish</p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="italic">Ever since Viking times, possibly long before, the sea has held a mysterious lure for the Norwegians. It has often brought sorrow to a family waiting for a loved one. But the sea is also generous; it has been the life source for many Norwegians for generations.</span></p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/37-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent1">The beloved Norwegian poet Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, in his poem <span class="italic">Den norske sjøman er</span>, tells a story of the courage, determination, and faith of the men who bravely struggled with the treacherous sea, whether they sailed the seven seas or were fishing the coastal waters of Norway.</p>

  <p class="indent">Most of us do not quite comprehend the dedication of the fishermen. We know only the enjoyment of the savory delicacies they bring to us—from herring to cod, from mackerel to haddock, from pollack to flounder and salmon, the shining king of the sea. Add to this the myriads of shellfish and you have culinary treats that continue to delight many of us.</p>

  <p class="indent">Properly prepared fish is not only tasty but sound nutrition. It is comparatively low in calories <a id="page_38"/>and has not been fed hormones, tranquilizers, and antibiotics as have domestic animals. The Norwegian Seafood Export council explains:</p>

  <p class="noindent1">There is no longer any doubt about direct links between diet and health. In this respect, food from the sea is extremely important. Fish is a magnificent source of protein. Such proteins are readily digested and have an ideal makeup. Amino acid compositions differ little from species to species. In latter years, fish fat has received much attention for its polyunsaturated, so-called Omega 3 fatty acids. Omega 3 fatty acids protect against cardiovascular diseases. They are vital to development of the brain and nervous system, and the retina of the eye. They are also necessary for fetal and infant development. New research indicates that Omega 3 fatty acids are also efficacious against chronic infections, diabetes and certain types of cancer.</p>

  <p class="indent">The human body needs vitamins. These are generally divided into two groups, water soluble and oil soluble. A lack of vitamins leads to reduced health and vitality, and even to serious deficiency diseases. Fish and seafood have a high content of a number of B vitamins (water soluble) and particularly vitamin <span class="small">B</span>12. Fat fish are the only natural source of vitamin D in our food. Fish also provide soluble vitamins A and E.</p>

  <p class="indent">Seafood gives a well balanced intake of a number of minerals. As a benefit to persons with high blood pressure, seafood is low in sodium while rich in potassium. A number of trace elements, including selenium, iodine, and fluorine, are required for proper health, and most of these are found in seafood. Fish supplies us with a natural form of selenium with no dosage risks.</p>

  <p class="noindent1">With abundant choice of fish available, it is easy to vary our meals. The simplest way to prepare fish is to simmer it in salted water. For variety add a little onion, bay leaf, dill, or pepper. Fish baked in the oven, or in foil, retains much of its aroma, juice, and flavor, and the resulting broth is simply delicious. Grilled fish is truly tasty and can be prepared with a minimum of fat. Fish casseroles may be varied by the addition of potatoes, vegetables, various spices, sauces, and cheese. Fish soup can be made from the water in which the fish was cooked or from broth made by boiling fish skin and bones together. Fish broth should never be boiled more than 30 minutes.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/38-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent">My first recollection of truly fresh fish was when our family lived on the island of Kollen at the end of the Oslofjord, where it opens up into the Skagerak. We often caught our first fish in the morning as the sun’s first rays illumined the sea’s surface. In the fall and spring the wind would often whip the sea up around our row boat, making the fishing more exciting for us youngsters at least. Back on the island, the aroma of slowly simmering, fresh fish was to us, a great payment for our efforts. Fish for breakfast gave lots of energy to young bodies craving nutrients. The memories of those days are a far cry from what some markets today call “fresh fish.”</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Look for these signs of freshness:</span> Clean fresh smell, clear bulging eyes, bright red gills, and shiny, smooth, and elastic yet firm flesh. Herring may have red eyes and mackerel may have dark gills, but this does not necessarily mean that either is old and unpalatable. Following your “catch,” rush home and let the fish bask for a while in cold running water, or let it rest for about one hour in lightly salted water. This will help bring out maximum flavor.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Preparing fish:</span> All fish after it has been cleaned, and unless freshly caught, should be soaked in water, to which has been added 3 tablespoons salt to 1 quart (liter) water about 20–30 minutes. This way any possible taste, intestine, and other matter are drawn into the water.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_39"/><span class="bold">Boiled, sliced fish:</span> Cod, salmon, mackerel, or pollack slices should be placed in boiling, well-salted water. The fish must <span class="italic">not</span> boil. Simmer from 5–10 minutes depending on thickness of slice and type of fish. Lean fish requires less cooking time than fat. If you are not planning to utilize the fish broth, add 4–4 ½ tablespoons salt to each quart (liter) of water and if desired, a teaspoon of vinegar, which results in a firmer and whiter flesh. If you intend to use the broth for sauce or gravy only, use one tablespoon salt to each quart of water.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Boiled whole fish:</span> Lean fish such as ling, cod, pollack, or billet falls apart easily and should not be cooked whole. If you intend to prepare this type of fish whole, bake rather than boil. Fatty fish such as salmon, trout, fresh water herring, or mackerel may be boiled whole in a fish poacher or large kettle, or it may be baked. There should be a rack in the bottom of the utensil for easy removal of fish to platter. In an emergency a piece of foil may be substituted for the rack. If a large fish is placed whole in boiling water the skin will break and the outer parts of the fish will be overcooked and dry by the time the heat reaches the backbone. Therefore, large fish, from 2–4 ½ pounds (900 g–2 kg) should be placed in cold water; cooking time, from 30–50 minutes. Medium fish, from 1–2 pounds (450–900 g) are placed in lukewarm water; cooking time, 20–30 minutes. Small fish, less than 1 pound (450 g) are placed in boiling, salted water; cooking time, 10–20 minutes.</p>

  <p class="indent">It is difficult to judge when a whole fish is thoroughly cooked. To make this determination carefully prick the fish close to the backbone, and if the meat leaves the bone and has become dull and non-transparent, it is done. Another way is to measure the thickness of the fish. Place fish on flat surface and measure thickness with a ruler next to the thickest part. Then follow the cooking time as suggested in the table:</p>

  <p class="cap2"><span class="italic">The wrinkled skin, the grayish dark gills, and cloudy sunken eyes are enough to scare the hungriest cat away. If you start out with old fish, deep fry it until the grease is dripping, or broil it until desert dry, or smother it in a thick layer of bread crumbs until any resemblance of the original has vanished; you should not wonder why your family thinks they don’t like fish.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Cooking in foil on top of the stove:</span> Either whole or sliced fish may be cooked in foil. Cleaned and washed, it is placed on a piece of foil and salted. If whole, salt the fish inside the abdomen as well as the entire outside. Use up to 1 tablespoon salt for each 2 pounds (900 g) of fish. A squeeze or two of lemon may be sprinkled over the fish. Spices such as dill, chives, parsley, basil, paprika, curry, and the like may be added. Wrap the foil tightly around the fish and place, with the folding side facing up, on top of potatoes which are being boiled in a small amount of water. Cooking time for fish slices or chunks is from 10–20 minutes. Fish cooked in this manner will retain its taste and aroma. The resulting broth, contained in the foil, maybe used for gravy.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/39-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_40"/><span class="bold">Cooking in foil in the oven:</span> Butter a piece of foil. Rub salt into a 1–2 pound (450–900 g) cleaned and washed fish. Parsley, dill or other spices sprinkled into the abdomen imparts added flavor. Place the whole fish on the foil, wrap tightly and lay in a small roasting pan with the folded side up. Pour a cup of water into the pan and bake at 375°F (190°C) in the oven. Cooking time varies according to the size of fish, but allow about 45 minutes for a 3 ½ pound (1 ½ kg) fish. Remaining broth in the foil can be used for gravy or mixed with some melted butter and served with the fish.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Grilled fish:</span> Fat fish such as salmon, herring, and trout is especially suited to grilling. Flounder is also good, but lean fish such as cod falls apart easily. Fish may be grilled whole or sliced. Place in double grill rack which has been greased, and grill for 3–5 minutes on each side. Salt the fish after it is cooked. Or add spices to the fish, wrap in lightly buttered foil and grill directly on the coals.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Deep-fat fried fish:</span> Fish fillets or small, whole fish may be deep fat fried in shortening and oil at a temperature of 350°F (175°C). If a thermometer is not available it is easy to determine proper cooking temperature by dropping a bread cube into the hot oil; if it turns golden brown within one minute it is ready to receive the fish. The fish to be fried must be completely dry. It may be fried plain or breaded, but breading results in a delicious crisp crust. Or it may be dipped in salted pancake batter. Do not reuse the oil. It is not good for your health, nor does it lend to the flavor of the fish.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Frozen fish:</span> A great variety of fish is available in frozen form. Although frozen fish is not quite comparable to fresh fish, it is tasty and a great convenience to our busy lives today.</p>

  <p class="indent">If you are lucky enough to have in your possession more fresh fish than can be eaten in one meal, utilize the freezer. Lean fish has better keeping qualities than fat fish. To prepare fish for freezing, clean and wash well, and slice or cut into fillets. Small fish should be frozen whole. Fat fish should be frozen in blocks of ice, or coated in ice, to maintain its quality.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Block freezing:</span> Clean and wash the fish. Put in large container (square or rectangular fits best in freezer) and cover with water. Freeze. When frozen remove the block from the container and wrap in foil. Put dividers between the fish which has been sliced or fillet for easy removal.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/40-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Ice coating:</span> Put cleaned and washed fish in plastic bag and allow to remain in the freezer for 24 hours. Remove and dip in cold water. Return to freezer until the water is frozen. Repeat two or three times until a layer of ice is formed around the fish. Wrap for freezing.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Vegetables to serve with fish:</span> Fish has a rather neutral taste, therefore most vegetables are compatible with its flavor. Leek, green beans, broccoli, peas, carrots, and cucumber salad is excellent with any fish meal. Boiled rutabaga and cabbage is great with herring. Stewed vegetables are best with fried fish, and salads with boiled, baked, or fried fish.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Which sauce to serve:</span> For years, melted or browned butter was the most widely used accompaniment for fish, but today most people prefer a less fattening sauce, merely fish broth or lemon juice. Use as little butter as possible when frying fish. A thin sauce can be made by using four tablespoons of flour to one quart broth or liquid, varying the taste by adding leek, parsley, dill, celery, mushrooms, asparagus, horseradish, shellfish, tomato purée, curry, or basil.</p>

  <p class="h3">Cod (Torsk)</p>

  <p class="cap1"><span class="italic">During one of my visits to Norway a dear friend’s face lit up in utter disbelief when, in answer to “What would you like for dinner?” my reply was, “Boiled cod.” She protested, but memories were too vivid and delectable cod it was.</span></p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/40-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent"><a id="page_41"/>The Norwegians have always loved cod ever since Viking times when they were used as both food and in trading. To this day, most Norwegians enjoy at least one cod dinner a week. The mild taste of cod makes it easy to vary the menu, and most vegetables are a fitting accompaniment.</p>

  <p class="noindent1">Cod or any fish for that matter has to be fresh—absolutely fresh—to make those taste buds come alive. The advice of Thorstein Diesen from the book <span class="italic">Norsk Mat</span> is well taken:</p>

  <p class="noindent1">“When you go to purchase a cod, remember that most people can consume an unbelievable amount. A good cod head is one of the happiest acquaintances one can make. A cod, so fresh there is still a twinkle in his eyes, can spark an indescribable appetite.</p>

  <p class="noindent1">As soon as the cod is in the house, prepare it. As with flowers, so with cod—you must talk to it and handle it gently to reap the maximum goodness.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Begin by letting the fish <span class="italic">enjoy</span> itself under running water. If this is impossible, let the fish rest awhile in lightly salted water. It will produce the same results.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Rule No. 1:</span> A good basic rule when slicing fish into serving portions is never make the slices thicker than your finger.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Rule No. 2:</span> Use plenty of salt. Double the amount normally called for in most fish recipes. The very best method (not practical in most areas) is to cook the cod in clear sea water, adding an extra portion of salt.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Rule No. 3:</span> Never allow cod to boil. This is a cardinal sin! After the water has reached the boiling point, carefully lower the fish into the boiling water, reduce the heat and simmer gently until done. It is done when the flesh is no longer translucent and separates easily from the bones. Fish which has been overcooked and loses its shape, also loses its serving attractiveness. If you are preparing a large quantity of fish it is advisable to use more than one utensil, or just cook a portion at a time, even if it is necessary to keep your guests waiting. The cod must be served steaming hot.</p>

  <p class="indent">Remove fish with a slotted spoon, if you are not lucky enough to own a steamer with perforated tray. Place carefully on a heated platter, and insert a small bunch of parsley in the cod’s mouth. Garnish with lemon slices and sprinkle with chopped parsley. Nothing but melted <span class="italic">butter</span> (no substitutes) will do for such a dish, but please melt carefully so as not to scorch it.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Rule No. 4:</span> Serve the cod on heated dinner plates. In fact heat two plates per person in case of second servings. Since the cod in itself is quite colorless, it is of great importance to set an attractively, colorful table. A bright red tablecloth with contrasting blue dishes, and a centerpiece of fresh flowers will impress your guests as a dinner well remembered. The usual accompaniment to a cod dinner is tiny, boiled, steam-dried and buttered potatoes. A melon ball cutter is useful in shaping the potato balls. Serve in a heated bowl with butter and chopped parsley. Cheese and crackers, together with some fruit, make a grand finale to a delicious meal.”</p>

  <p class="h3">Party Cod (Festtorsk)</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/41-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent">Slice cod fillets into uniform, square serving pieces. Dip in slightly beaten egg white and salted zwieback crumbs. Lightly brown the fish in margarine. Lay half of the fish pieces in an oven-proof casserole dish. Mix a few chopped, pickled onions with a little butter and top each section of fish with a spoonful. Make a second layer of remaining fish. Sprinkle one tablespoon grated Jarlsberg, or other mild cheese, on each section and top with cooked spinach mixed with a little mayonnaise. Bake in a 450°F (230°C) oven for 5–8 minutes. Serve at once. Decorate with tomatoes and parsley.</p>

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_42"/>Lutefish (Lutefisk)</p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="italic">Every country has its culinary specialties. Nostalgic memories tug at your heartstrings if, when separated by distance, these favorites are set before you. Norway’s lutefish is such a specialty to many.</span></p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/42-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent1">Lutefisk (dried cod treated with lye) must surely be the strangest culinary effort credited to the Norwegians but what a treat when prepared properly. Everyone of course is not a devotee of lutefish, but there are those who defend it vehemently. Others go to the opposite extreme and claim it’s a national disgrace. In years past the homemaker had to go through the complicated task of treating the dry fish with lye, but now, even in America, frozen lutefish is readily available at selected fish markets and at Scandinavian delicatessens.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Cooking lutefish the old-fashioned way:</span> Do not cook in aluminum vessels as it will darken the kettle. Use 3 level tablespoons salt to each quart of water. Bring water to a boil, add salt, and return to a boil. Add fish which has been sliced into serving pieces and again return to boil, then remove from the heat. Skim, and let fish steep for 5–10 minutes depending on thickness. Serve at once.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Without added water:</span> Put the serving pieces of lutefish in a kettle, season each pound (450 g) of fish with ½ tablespoon of salt and place over low heat. This allows the water to be “drawn” out. Bring to a boil and remove from heat. Let steep 5–10 minutes. Serve at once.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Baking in foil:</span> Heat the oven to 400°F (205°C). Skin side down, arrange lutefish on a sheet of double aluminum foil and season with salt. Wrap foil tightly about fish and place on rack in a large pan and bake 20 minutes. Cut corner from foil and drain out excess water. Serve at once.</p>

  <p class="indent">Lutefish with a firm texture can be obtained by first sprinkling with coarse salt and allowing to stand for several hours. Rinse well in cold running water, and soak in unsalted water. Then cook or bake as desired.</p>

  <p class="indent">Lutefish must be served hot on piping hot plates. Accompaniments vary from bacon or pork drippings, white sauce, mustard sauce, or melted butter which seems to remain a favorite. Boiled and steamed potatoes, and stewed whole, dry green peas are a must as a vegetable accompaniment. The only other necessary additions are freshly ground pepper, lefse or flatbread. In some parts of Northern Norway lutefish is served with melted goat cheese.</p>

  <p class="h3">Corned Salmon (Gravlaks)</p>

  <p class="cap1"><span class="italic">Splendid May with budding trees, colorful flowers, longer days, and delectable salmon! From early May through the first part of summer salmon is sovereign in Norway. During this period every restaurant menu includes fresh or smoked salmon. You will also find gravlaks</span>, <span class="italic">marinated salmon, extolled by many as salmon at its best, and now popular anew.</span></p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/42-3.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="credit">Photo credit: Alf Bjøresen</p>

  <p class="noindent1"><a id="page_43"/>At one time salmon was so abundant along the coast of Norway and served so frequently that servants required a special guarantee clause in their contract that limited the serving of salmon to two or three times a week. Today salmon is expensive and considered <span class="italic">festmat,</span> gourmet food. <span class="italic">Gravlaks</span> may be served as an appetizer or as a main course, usually served with dill sauce and creamed potatoes</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">3 lbs. (1,350 g.) filleted salmon, center cut</p>

  <p class="ing">¼ cup (½ dl) salt</p>

  <p class="ing">¼ cup (½ dl) sugar</p>

  <p class="ing">1 large bunch of dill</p>

  <p class="ingl">20 white peppercorns, or substitute with black</p>

  <p class="noindent">Ask your fishmonger to cut the salmon in half lengthwise and remove the backbone and all small bones. At home, rinse the fish well and dry in a towel. Wash the fresh dill and dry on paper towels. Place a thick layer of dill into a deep casserole or baking dish. (If the dill was grown in a greenhouse, it will not be as pungent, in this case, chop the herb to release its flavor and sprinkle it over the fish instead.)</p>

  <p class="indent">In a separate bowl, combine salt, sugar, and crushed white pepper. Sprinkle some of the spices over dill. Rub the fillets with some of the spices, and place one fillet skin side down in the dill. Again sprinkle the salmon generously with the spices and dill. Add the second piece of fish, skin side up. Make sure the thicker part of one fillet is pressed against the thinner part of the other. Finally, add the remaining dill and spices. Cover with aluminum foil or clear wrap. Place a wooden board slightly larger than the salmon on top and add a light weight to press it down, three to four food cans, distribute the weight evenly. Let the fish stand from 24–36 hours in the refrigerator. Turn the fish every 12 hours, but make sure the two fillets remain pressed closely together. Baste the salmon with the liquid marinade that accumulates, separating the halves a little to baste the salmon on the inside. Replace the wooden board and weights each time.</p>

  <p class="indent">When the <span class="italic">gravlaks</span> is ready to be served, remove the salmon from its marinade, scrape away the dill and spices, and gently pat dry with paper towels. To slice, place the separated halves skin side down, and use a sharp knife to cut across the fish at a sharp angle, slicing thinly and detaching each slice from the skin. It should be served cold and maybe kept in the refrigerator for several days if necessary. Serve decorated with dill and twisted lemon slices. If used as a main course, serve with boiled/steamed potatoes, fresh peas, and dill sauce.</p>

  <p class="h3">Baked Salmon (Ovnstekt laks)</p>

  <p class="cap1"><span class="italic">A whole, baked salmon, though easy to prepare, is a feast for the eyes and palate. We have served it to many guests in our home over the years, and always, accolades are unending. Baked whole salmon is marvelous with a smorgasbord, or julebord.</span></p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/43-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">1 whole salmon (whatever size needed)</p>

  <p class="ing">Butter</p>

  <p class="ing">Dill or parsley</p>

  <p class="ing">Water, fish bouillon, milk, or cream</p>

  <p class="ing">Tomatoes</p>

  <p class="ingl">English cucumbers</p>

  <p class="noindent"><a id="page_44"/>Have your fishmonger clean the fish. As soon as you bring it home wash it under running cold water. The blood and the dark membrane must be rinsed or brushed away. By rubbing a little salt in first it will come off easier. Quickly dry the fish after rinsing. Rub in the salt and place on buttered heavy aluminum foil. Place a pat or two of butter in the cavity, and add a few tufts of dill or parsley. Cover tightly and follow baking direction for fat fish. The salmon is ready when the back fin comes off and when a toothpick inserted in the thickest part is easily penetrated.</p>

  <p class="indent">Carefully remove salmon to a hot platter. Remove the skin off the top layer. Tuck some dill or parsley, tomato wedges, and cucumber slices around the salmon. Slit thin lemon slices, twist, and garnish the delicate fish; add some greens if needed and sprinkle with paprika. Strain the broth and serve as is, or use to make sauce of your choice, such as rémoulade. Or serve the traditional way, with hot melted butter to which chopped fresh chives have been added. Serve with boiled/steamed potatoes, vegetables, and traditional cucumber salad.</p>

  <p class="h3">Salmon Platter (Laksekabarét)</p>

  <p class="cap1"><span class="italic">A wonderful dish for a party, and a good way to make the salmon go further is to make this salmon platter. An added bonus is that most can be prepared a day in advance. Serve with hard rolls or fresh bread.</span></p>

  <p class="ingl">1 head Boston lettuce</p>

  <p class="noindent">The day before, clean and carefully steep the salmon. Remove skin and bones while still warm, and place them back in the fish broth. Cool salmon and place in covered container. Boil the eggs, cool, shell, and put in a covered container. Clean the shrimp and place in plastic bag. Wash and dry lettuce and place in plastic bag.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Just before the guests arrive arrange the lettuce with the salmon on top on a large platter. Add chopped eggs, quartered tomatoes, sliced cucumbers, and shrimp (save a few out). Stir mayonnaise with a little light cream, and a few drops of fresh lemon juice. Pour mayonnaise over all and decorate in diamond shapes with finely chopped parsley and shrimp.</p>

  <p class="ing2">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">3 lbs.trout, appr.</p>

  <p class="ing">½ tsp. pepper</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tsp. salt</p>

  <p class="ingl">1 bunch dill, fresh</p>

  <p class="noindent1">Wash fish under cold running water and pat dry. Tie a heavy string around the head/neck of the trout. Pull the string to the tail and tie around the tale as well. That way you get a nice bend when the fish stands. Add salt and pepper to the cavity and also a little dill. Place the fish in a baking pan and cover it with aluminum foil. Bake at 390°F (200°C) for 30–40 minutes, or until the fish is finished. The fish is done when the back fin comes off easily; or you can place a knife along the backbone and when the fish meat loosens readily and the fish has <a id="page_45"/>changed color. Carefully remove the fish to a platter. Remove the skin. Outline the center back with a stripe of mayonnaise; add dill and lemon slices or wedges.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/46-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent1">In the spring the mackerel is low in fat (approx. 3 percent). However in the autumn it can contain as much as 30 percent fat, which means an abundance of Omega 3 fatty acids. And don’t forget mackerel is a rich source of vitamin D and B12.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">2 lbs. (900 g.) mackerel, approx.</p>

  <p class="h3">Dishes of Salted Herring (Retter av spekesild)</p>

  <p class="noindent">Salted herring must be cleaned and fillet before it is soaked. By placing the herring to soak in a mixture of water and milk, one is assured of a firm, white, and delicate fish. Heavily salted herring should be soaked a minimum of 12 hours. Herring dishes improve in flavor as they stand.</p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="italic">Pickled herring was reserved for weekend breakfasts, and other special treats like a sildebord.</span></p>

  <p class="noindent1">For this dish you will need salted herring, available at Scandinavian delicatessens. Friday was salted herring day in our home, as it was a very inexpensive food at the time. No freshly ironed tablecloth this day. Mamma would spread out a double sheet of wax paper for each, then she’d place the cooked potatoes and herring on each place setting. That was it! Pappa loved this meal; he would take one herring fillet at a time and meticulously cut them in even pieces and eat them with the potatoes.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">2–4 salted herring fillets</p>

  <p class="ing">1 cup (2 ½ dl) water</p>

  <p class="ing">3 bay leaves</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tbsp. black peppercorns, whole</p>

  <p class="ingl">⅔ cup (1 ½ dl) wine vinegar</p>

  <p class="noindent5">Clean herring, cut off the tail and head, and rinse well in running cold water. Make a shallow cut in the skin along the backbone and peel off skin, pulling towards tail end. Fillet. Put in a mixture of milk and water, enough to cover, and allow to stand about 12 hours. Remove and drain. Cut fillets in 1 inch (2 ½ cm) pieces. Thinly slice onions. Layer the herring and the onion slices alternately in a glass jar. Add bay leaves. Bring vinegar, water, sugar, and pepper to a boil, let cool. Pour over herring and refrigerate. Let stand at least overnight before serving. Standing improves flavor.</p>

  <p class="h3">Haddock (Hyse)</p>

  <p class="noindent">Freshness is all important, both for taste and success in making these dishes. Get acquainted with your fishmonger and his expected arrival of fish. Have him give you a ring when your particular delicacy arrives—then waste no time getting there. Hurry home just as quickly, and prepare your fish immediately. From experience I know you will have a most rewarding few hours.</p>

  <p class="noindent1">you will need:</p>

  <p class="ing1">One 8–9 lbs. (3 ¼–4 kg.) haddock,</p>

  <p class="ing">4 stalks celery, large</p>

  <p class="ing">7 large eggs</p>

  <p class="ing">½ cup (1 ¼ dl) salt pork</p>

  <p class="ing">½ cup (1 ¼ dl) potato starch flour (not corn starch)</p>

  <p class="ing">4 onions, medium</p>

  <p class="ing">1 cup (2 ½ dl) coffee cream</p>

  <p class="ing">1 qt. (liter) cold milk, very fresh</p>

  <p class="ing">½ lb. (225 g.) shrimp</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tbsp. nutmeg, grated</p>

  <p class="ingl">Salt to taste</p>

  <p class="noindent"><a id="page_49"/>Have the fish cleaned and filleted. Be sure to ask for the head, fin parts, and backbone. If your fishmonger is as nice as mine (he probably is) he no doubt will throw in an extra head or two for broth. Rinse fish well in cold, running water and dry on paper towels. Place the heads, fins, and backbones in a large kettle, cover completely with cold water, and add two generous tablespoons of salt. Cover and bring to boil. Boil gently for 30 minutes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Now, back to the fillets. If using a meat grinder, grind the fish three times (or use a food processor, or place small amounts of fish and onion at a time in a blender and blend for 1 minute at high speed) and blend together with 2 peeled onions. Discard the slivers of fish that adhere to the grinder blades. In order to salvage all bits of fish in the grinder it is helpful to put through a cut-up, peeled raw potato. Put entire amount of pureed fish in a large bowl, add 1 tablespoon salt, 1 tablespoon grated nutmeg, and mix thoroughly. Add 3 eggs, one at a time, beating at least 5 minutes after each addition. Add ½ cup (1 ½ dl) of potato starch flour and beat again. Add 1 quart (liter) fresh, whole milk, 1 ounce (2 tbsp.) at a time, mixing well with each ounce. When all the milk has been added continue to beat for another 15 minutes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Drain the kettle containing the fish parts and transfer fish broth to another large kettle. After the fish parts have cooled, remove all fish meat and place in a covered container and refrigerate. This will be used for gratin and chowder, which may be made at a later date-but within one week.</p>

  <p class="indent">Divide the ground fillet mixture into thirds, refrigerating two thirds and reserving one third for immediate use.</p>

  <p class="noindent">When our family lived on the island of Kollen some 60 miles out from Oslo, one of my favorite things to do was to go out fishing with Pappa. Fish are such delicate creatures and sooner you get them home and start cooking them the better they taste. And Mamma stood ready with a hot frying pan and prepared them in an uncomplicated manner. Flounder is a great tasting fish. The flounder has a thick skin which is easy to strip off before it is baked or cooked.</p>
