 PULLED BEEF IN BRIOCHE</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_pink" id="nad0001061">
<em>Pulled meat, of any sort, has recently become very popular, especially at festivals and street food markets. I have tried so many variations, and everyone has their own way of doing it. I like my pulled meat to be stringy and tender, with a runny sauce that is just slightly thickened. I often cook mine in a slow cooker, but you can cook it equally well on the stovetop or in the oven. This recipe creates a delicious combination of sweet, sour and hot chilli, with freshness from the coriander scattered over at the end.</em>

<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Put the olive oil into a large ovenproof crockpot or large non-stick frying pan, and place on a high heat. Season the beef with salt really well on all sides. Put the beef into the pot or pan and fry for a few minutes on each side, till the exterior is brown and crisp, then take out and set aside.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001079">
<span class="pink">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 To the same pan add the onions, garlic and 1 teaspoon of salt, and cook until the onions are softened. Now add the chopped tomatoes, brown sauce, honey, vinegar and paprika and cook for 5 minutes on a medium heat, until the mixture has reduced and thickened.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001080">
<span class="pink">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 If you are using the oven, preheat it to 180°C/160°C fan/gas 4.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001081">
<span class="pink">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 If you are using the same crockpot, put the beef back into the pot. If you are using a slow cooker, put in the beef along with the cooked onion and tomato mixture. Pour over the beef stock and give it all a good stir.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001082">
<span class="pink">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 For a slow cooker, cook on high for 3 hours. On the stovetop, cook with the lid on for 3 hours on a medium to low heat. If cooking in the oven, it will need 3 hours with the lid on.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001083">
<span class="pink">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Check the meat halfway through cooking – if the liquid is drying up too fast, lower the oven heat slightly and add another 100ml of water.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001084">
<span class="pink">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 After 3 hours take the beef out and use two forks to pull it apart. Put the meat back into the pan. Stir in the sriracha and the cornflour paste, and cook for another 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001085">
<span class="pink">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 Take off the heat and stir in the fresh coriander.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001086">

<strong>9.</strong>
</span>
 Serve the pulled beef with sliced brioche buns. Sandwich the meat in between the buns and give them a go.</p>
