</h1>
<p class="pf">I sat at the table with my aging mother, playing our daily game of Scrabble. Scrabble kept her mind alive, but her shoulder cracked as she strained to reach the corner of the board, seizing every opportunity to cover each corner and grab the triple-point spot each time I came within four squares of it. Then she would ask me, “How much are you ahead now?”</p>
<p>“Mom,” I’d say, “you’re fifty-four points ahead.” “Oh, you just let me!” she would exclaim. Although she would never admit it, she always was competitive. For instance, even as her eyesight was failing she wanted to prove she could still read. She would read signs while I drove her to a clinic appointment or to visit her sister at the Chris Jensen nursing home in Duluth. I could usually predict which ones she would read out loud: “Bigger better bagels; a dollar thirty-one for gas, it’s gone down three cents; men working; yield . . . drive-through window?”</p>
<p>As we played Scrabble I sipped my herbal tea and she, her hot apple cider. She never cared for tea. “Tastes funny,” she would say.</p>
<p>Outside, one of the kids was cutting the field grass, making large swirled cuts with the riding mower. What we call our lawn is really an old field, once a pasture for cows. It’s mostly dandelions, hawkweed, plantain, and quackgrass. But the smell of the newly cut greens is sweet, and when the mower makes a swipe by the mint-gone-wild, the aroma floats into the house.</p>
<p>On the table next to the Scrabble board I had placed our old Dazey butter churn, still in perfect condition but long out of use. I took it down from its perch on the shelf because it needed dusting. (I’m a stream-of-consciousness housekeeper—if I notice something needs to be done I do it right away.) As I looked at my mother, and at the butter churn, my mind floated back to my childhood days.</p>
<p>The hunched woman sitting across from me, trying to figure out how to make words with a shortage of vowels, was once seven inches taller and forty pounds heavier and stood tall and strong. She would skim the rich, heavy cream at the top of chilled fresh milk from the prior evening’s milking, then pour it into this very churn. It was my job to churn it into butter. If the cream was too warm, it wouldn’t turn into butter, which made churning an early-morning job in the summertime.</p>
<p>I think back: I’m ten years old. I sit on the front steps of the farmhouse where I grew up, turning the crank that makes the paddles inside the glass jar spin. The cream splashes up and coats the little removable screen on the top of the churn. My eyes quickly shift left and right. Nobody’s watching. I lift the little screened lid and lick it clean, then quickly snap it back into place.</p>
<p>Fresh cream has always been my favorite food. I savor the texture, the sweet aroma, and with my tongue rub its richness all over inside my mouth. There’s a faint grassy taste. The cows have been out to pasture, and the cream tastes different when they feed on fresh grass.</p>
<p>The cream finally begins to thicken, then separates into solids and liquid. I drain away the watery liquid and turn the pale yellow butter into a heavy crockery bowl. With a wooden spoon I press the butter together, pressing out more and more of the excess liquid. I sprinkle a little salt over the butter—about a half teaspoonful—and work it into the shiny, smooth mass. At this point a creamery might have added annatto to color the butter a deeper yellow. I dimple the top with the tip of the spoon, cover it, then put it into the icebox.</p>
<p>Mom baked huge batches of rye bread almost every second day, summer and winter. Later, when the loaves came out of the oven of the woodstove, I’d cut a thick slice and slather it with fresh butter. The melting stream of gold ran through my fingers and almost to my elbow, except that I’d lick it off my arm.</p>
<p>My dad even buttered the chocolate cake he cut out of the 9- by 13-inch cake pan with a spoon. That wasn’t so bad, but Uncle Frank buttered his doughnuts. We never buttered the pulla, the Finnish cardamom bread. It didn’t need it.</p>
<p>Now, these many years later, there is my aging mother, across the table from me, playing a game that she never had the time for in earlier years. I am so privileged to be here.</p>
