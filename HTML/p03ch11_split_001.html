<p class="summary"><span class="bi">In Spain, rice dishes are served as a first course, but many are so rich and</span> complex with so many ingredients that they are a meal in themselves. You could eat a different, equally delicious rice dish every day of the year. Any rice dish with chicken can also be made with rabbit, quail, duck, or partridges. Seafood rice can be made with different fish and seafood. Meaty rice dishes can have different sausages, pork ribs, meatballs, or pig’s feet and ears. And vegetables in season always have a place in rice dishes.</p>
<p class="summary">Arabs first introduced the grain in the early Middle Ages, and Berber peasants were brought in from North Africa to grow it. Berbers remained to work the rice fields well into the seventeenth century, and many villages still bear the names of their tribes (see page 536). <span class="italic">Arroz,</span> the Spanish word for “rice” (it is <span class="italic">arròs</span> in Catalan and Valencian) comes from the Arabic <span class="italic">roz.</span></p>
<p class="summary">People eat rice all over Spain, and now many regions grow it. Andalusia and Extremadura are very big producers, and the colder regions of Aragon and Navarre also cultivate rice. But the historical rice-growing regions where rice is a staple are the Mediterranean regions of Catalonia, Valencia, and Murcia. Their high-quality indigenous Spanish rices are protected by <span class="italic">Denominaciones de Origen</span>: Arroz del Delta del Ebro, Arroz de Valencia, and Calasparra. Rice is classified commercially by the size of the grains and the relationship between their length and width. Indigenous Spanish rice is medium- or short-grain. Long-grain rice was introduced recently, mainly for export, but it is now also sold in Spain for cooking plain white rice and for new-style dishes such as rice salad. Some varieties of short- or round-grain make sticky rice that falls apart and is best for stuffing vegetables and some puddings. The special characteristic of Spanish medium-grain rice is that it has a higher starch content than the long-grain (the starch is stored in a white <span class="italic">perla,</span> or “pearl,” that you can see as a white spot), and that allows it to absorb maximum flavor from the stock in which it is cooked and from the other ingredients. It can absorb twice its volume of liquid while still remaining as separate grains.</p>
<p class="summary">In her book <span class="italic">El libro de la paella y los arroces</span> (<span class="italic">The Book of Paella and Rice Dishes</span>) published in 1985, the celebrated Spanish food writer and broadcaster Lourdes March uses medium-grain rice for all the traditional Spanish recipes except for stuffed vegetables and puddings, for which she uses short-grain. But her book was written before Bomba, an ancient strain of tiny round rice that was nearly extinct, became famous and in demand starting a decade or so ago, after it was acclaimed by celebrity chefs and written about by foreign journalists. Bomba is said to be the rice for “people who can’t cook paella or haven’t the time to watch it,” because it keeps a firm shape and does not easily overcook—it can absorb up to three times its own volume in liquid without falling apart. Bomba has become the rice of choice for chefs and gourmets. It is more than twice the price of other Spanish rices because the yield of the plants is low. It was neglected in Franco’s time when high production was required. The three <span class="italic">Denominaciones de Origen</span> now produce Bomba, as do some other regions too.</p>

<p class="summary">At home, people still cook with the medium-grain rice they are used to (it is considered sacrilegious to use long-grain for paella). The major types of medium-grain are Senia, in the marshlands surrounding the Albufera lagoon in Valencia; Bahia and Montsianell in the flatlands of the Ebro River in Catalonia; and the hybrid Balilla x Sollana in the mountains of Murcia along the banks of the Segura River near the town of Calasparra. Calasparra has become famous for its Bomba rice, because the sowing and harvesting is done by hand on the small terraces where machinery cannot get to, and the irrigation water comes from cold mountain springs; Moorish-type canals, dams, and waterwheels continue to regulate the flooding and draining of the rice paddies, much as they did in the early Middle Ages. Over the last twelve years, both Catalonia and Valencia have cultivated a high-quality Bomba. The growers there are very active in agricultural research to improve varieties and methods of sowing, harvesting, and processing (hand labor, they say, is for tourists). What makes a rice grain different is the <span class="italic">terroir</span>—the environment and climate in which it grows: humid flatlands, cold mountains, or drylands.</p>
<p class="summary">The important thing about cooking Spanish rice dishes is knowing how to handle the grain—how much water it needs, how long to cook it. I have learned most of what I know from Lourdes March, who is a longtime friend. In Spain, rice is never soaked or washed before cooking. Stock is almost always used to cook it, not water, and the stock has to be boiling when it comes in contact with the rice. Different amounts of liquid are required for different types of dishes. “Dry” rice dishes (<span class="italic">arroz seco</span>) cooked <span class="italic">al horno</span> (in earthenware casseroles in the oven) need about twice the volume of stock to rice. Rice cooked in wide shallow paella pans needs more liquid because much of it evaporates. Moist <span class="italic">arroces melosos</span> with a so-called honey texture (<span class="italic">miel</span> means “honey”) are cooked in large saucepans with two and a half times the amount of stock to rice by volume, while the <span class="italic">arroces caldosos</span> (soupy rice dishes) need three times the amount of stock.</p>
<p class="summary">When cooking rice, you add all the stock at once, unlike when making risotto, and you stir only once with a wooden spoon, then leave the rice alone. You do not keep stirring throughout the cooking, because that would break some grains and release the starch that gives Italian risotto its creamy, slightly sticky texture—something that is not desirable in a Spanish rice dish.</p>
<p class="summary">None of the cooks that I watched making rice ever measured. They all took handfuls of rice, saying “<span class="italic">un puñado</span>” (a handful) and added stock “<span class="italic">a ojo</span>” (by eye). It makes sense, because qualities of rice vary, and even the same type of grain from the same field can behave differently from one harvest to another. And depending on whether it is new or has been hanging around in a shop for ages, it will absorb different amounts of liquid and take more or less time to cook. The amount of water needed also depends on the size and shape of the pan or baking dish, the amount of rice, and the heat of the oven or burner. For soupy rice, the amount of liquid matters less than the cooking time, which is all-important. If you cook it for too long, the rice will be soggy and may fall apart. For paella, where the amount of liquid matters, there is no foolproof method to determine the exact quantity needed. Making paella is an art that is acquired through experience. You have to watch that the rice does not get too dry, adding a little more boiling stock or water if necessary, and that it does not overcook.</p>
<p class="summary">The general rule is to allow ½ cup uncooked rice per person. The recommended amount of salt needed is generally given as 1 teaspoon for 2 cups rice, but since in Spain rice is always cooked in stock, you have to take into consideration the saltiness of the stock, and of course salting always has to be a matter of taste. If you cannot find a Spanish rice—these are often labeled simply “paella rice”—you can use a risotto rice such as Arborio or Carnaroli. Do not use long-grain rice for these recipes.</p>
