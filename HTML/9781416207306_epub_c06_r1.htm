<p class="nonindent">Lamb cutlets are a ready-made finger food, with their own holders making them a really fun addition to your tapas menu. This recipe shows off lamb at its best. Get a rack of lamb that’s either middle neck, which is cheaper with more flavor but only five bones, or the best end of neck, which is more delicate and more expensive, with eight bones.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1 rack of lamb</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">4 tbsp. (1/2 stick) sweet butter</p>
<p class="hanging">1 small sprig fresh rosemary</p>
<p class="hanging">1 heaping tbsp. capers (I prefer capers in vinegar to salted)</p>
<p class="hanging02">juice of 1/2 lemon</p>
<p class="nonindent">Carve the lamb into individual cutlets. If the cutlets are really thick, you can pound them with a meat mallet to thin them out a bit, but I like them about 1/2 inch thick. Season with salt and pepper and rub with the oil. Heat a griddle pan on high heat until smoking. Cook the cutlets for 2–3 minutes on each side, remove from pan, and let rest.</p>
<p class="extract">In a small saucepan, melt the butter and add the rosemary. When it starts to foam, it will start to turn a nutty color. Add the capers, fry for 30 seconds, and then pour in the lemon juice. Remove pan from the heat and season with salt and pepper. Place the lamb in a serving dish and pour in the juices and burnt butter sauce.</p>

<p class="nonindent">This classic dish is normally made using milk-fed baby lambs. Most butchered lambs are around a year of age and on a solid diet, making their meat darker and richer. Milk-fed lamb is therefore hard to find. This recipe calls for half a lamb shoulder, making it the perfect size to bring to the table and tear apart.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1/2 shoulder of lamb, weighing about 2 lbs., on the bone</p>
<p class="hanging">2 carrots</p>
<p class="hanging">2 celery stalks</p>
<p class="hanging">1 leek</p>
<p class="hanging">2 onions</p>
<p class="hanging">1 (14–oz.) can plum tomatoes with juice</p>
<p class="hanging">3 whole garlic heads, halved, and papery skin removed</p>
<p class="hanging">1 cup white wine</p>
<p class="hanging">a few sprigs fresh thyme, rosemary, and parsley tied together</p>
<p class="hanging02">1 1/4 cups chicken stock</p>
<p class="nonindent">Heat the oven to 325°F. On top of the stove, carefully brown the shoulder all over in a roasting pan to get some color on the lamb and to render the fat a little. Remove the lamb and discard all but a couple of tablespoons of the fat. Chop the carrots, celery, leek, and onions into 1 1/2–inch chunks. Add them to the pan and brown all over. Add the tomatoes, garlic, wine, herbs, and stock, then put the lamb back in the pan.</p>
<p class="extract">Loosely cover the pan with a sheet of buttered parchment paper and cook in the oven for about 3 hours (check after 2 1/2). When it’s falling off the bone, it’s ready to serve.</p>

<p class="nonindent">The buttery texture of lamb fillet that’s been spiked with red chile, spices, and garlic and complemented with the Greek yogurt-based appetizer “tzatziki” makes for a scrumptious tapas.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1/2 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">2 cardamom pods, crushed</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tsp. ground cumin</p>
<p class="hanging">1 clove garlic, crushed</p>
<p class="hanging">1 red chile, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 small bunch fresh mint</p>
<p class="hanging">1 lamb fillet, about 10 1/2 oz., trimmed of fat</p>
<p class="hanging03">for the tzatziki</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 cucumber, cut into small dice</p>
<p class="hanging">2/3 cup fat-free Greek yogurt</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 bunch fresh mint, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging02">extra-virgin olive oil for drizzling</p>
<p class="nonindent">Pound the oil, cardamom, cumin, garlic, chile, and mint in a mortar and pestle. Rub mixture all over the lamb. Let this marinate for about 2 hours.</p>
<p class="extract">Mix the cucumber into the yogurt and season with plenty of salt and pepper and the mint.</p>
<p class="extract">Meanwhile, heat a griddle pan on high heat until almost smoking. Wipe off any excess marinade and cook the lamb in a dry pan on all sides until it is browned and feels firm to the touch. Let rest for a couple of minutes, then slice. Spread a layer of the cucumber yogurt on a serving plate and top with the lamb and a drizzle of olive oil.</p>

<p class="nonindent">A really fragrant southern Spanish lamb stew that’s shredded and served with polenta.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">14 oz. lamb shoulder meat, cubed</p>
<p class="hanging">1 onion, chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">1 carrot, peeled and chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">1 celery stalk, chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">4 cloves garlic, chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. tomato paste</p>
<p class="hanging">1 bay leaf</p>
<p class="hanging">really good pinch saffron</p>
<p class="hanging">good pinch smoked paprika</p>
<p class="hanging">few fresh thyme sprigs, chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">fresh rosemary sprig, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">few fresh parsley sprigs, chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">1 3/4 cups white wine</p>
<p class="hanging">1 3/4 cups lamb or chicken stock</p>
<p class="hanging">1 (14–oz.) can chopped tomatoes</p>
<p class="hanging04">for the polenta</p>
<p class="hanging">1 generous cup hot chicken stock</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 cup instant polenta</p>
<p class="hanging">1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</p>
<p class="hanging02">4 tbsp. (1/2 stick) unsalted butter</p>
<p class="nonindent">Preheat the oven to 325°F. Heat the olive oil in a heavy-duty Dutch oven, then cook the meat in batches until golden brown all over. Transfer the meat with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Add the onions, carrots, and celery to the pan and cook on a fairly low heat for 15 minutes or until the vegetables have softened and become slightly golden. For the last 2 minutes of cooking, add the garlic.</p>
<p class="extract">Stir in the tomato paste and cook for another minute. Add the bay leaf, saffron, paprika, thyme, rosemary, wine, stock, tomatoes, and half the parsley. Put the meat and all of its juices back into the pan. Give it a good stir, then put the lid on and place in the oven for 2 hours. The meat should be really soft and the sauce thick and rich.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Let the casserole rest outside the oven for 10 minutes, then go into it with two forks and shred the meat to bits. Meanwhile, make the polenta by bringing the stock to a rolling boil and pouring the polenta into it, stirring constantly. Continue cooking for 2 minutes, then remove the pan from the heat and beat in the cheese and butter. Season really well. You want it quite soft and smooth. Serve with the casserole in a large tapas bowl, topped with the remaining parsley.</p>

<p class="nonindent">This healthier take on roast lamb makes a scrumptious and piquant tapas. The fattiness of lamb is smoothed with the acidic pomegranate in the salad, glaze, and gravy.</p>
<p class="hanging01">4 tbsp. pomegranate molasses</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tsp. ground cumin</p>
<p class="hanging">juice of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">2 cloves garlic, minced</p>
<p class="hanging">1 onion, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">1/4 shoulder of lamb, weighing about 2 lbs., on the bone, lightly scored</p>
<p class="hanging">1 1/4 cups chicken or lamb stock</p>
<p class="hanging04">for the salad</p>
<p class="hanging">seeds of 1 pomegranate</p>
<p class="hanging">handful fresh flat-leaf parsley</p>
<p class="hanging">4 oz. watercress</p>
<p class="hanging">1 small red onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging02">1 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="nonindent">Heat oven to 325°F. In a small bowl, mix the molasses with the cumin, lemon juice, olive oil, and garlic. Scatter the onions over the bottom of a casserole dish or a deep roasting pan. Place the lamb on top of the onions. Pour the glaze over the lamb and rub it in a little. Rinse the bowl out with the stock, then pour it around — not over — the lamb.</p>
<p class="extract">Cover the dish with a lid or the pan with a large piece of foil. Roast the lamb, undisturbed, for 3 hours, then remove the lid or foil and continue to roast for 30 minutes more to give the lamb color. When the lamb has finished cooking, pour off the juices, remove as much fat as possible, and pour the juices back over the lamb. Just before serving, gently toss all the salad ingredients together. Serve the lamb with its sauce, accompanied by the salad.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Classically a Middle Eastern dish, this fragrant rice dish is great for sharing. Spiced with cinnamon, coriander, and cloves, and studded with sweet apricots, this dish is scrumptious.</p>
<p class="hanging01">small handful pine nuts or slivered almonds</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. olive oil</p>

<p class="hanging">6–8 dried apricots</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging02">handful fresh mint leaves, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="nonindent">Dry-fry the pine nuts or almonds in a large pan until lightly toasted, then tip onto a plate. Add the oil to the pan, then fry the onion, ground coriander, cinnamon, and cloves together until they start to turn golden. Raise the heat, stir in the lamb, and fry until the meat changes color. Add the rice and cook for 1 minute, stirring all the time.</p>
<p class="extract">Add the stock, apricots, salt, and pepper. Turn the heat down, cover, and simmer for 12 minutes until the rice is tender and the stock has been absorbed. Toss in the nuts and mint and serve.</p>

<p class="nonindent">I first came across this dish as an appetizer in an Italian restaurant many years ago, but it makes the most wonderful tapas. Expect pink lamb, surrounded by crisp fragrant crumbs dotted with capers and herbs.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1 rack of lamb</p>
<p class="hanging">3/4 cup flour</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">1 large free-range egg, lightly beaten</p>
<p class="hanging">2 cups fresh bread crumbs</p>
<p class="hanging">small handful fresh mint, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. capers, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging02">1/2 cup olive oil</p>
<p class="nonindent">Cut the lamb into cutlets, then place a double sheet of plastic wrap over each one and pound with a mallet to flatten a bit. Keep in mind you still want them to be about 1/4 inch thick, rather than really thin like a scallop. Place the flour (which you should season with lots of salt and pepper), the egg, and the bread crumbs in separate bowls. Add the chopped mint and capers to the bread crumbs and mix thoroughly.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Dip each cutlet into the flour, then the egg (coating them very well, as this will act like a glue), and finally into the bread crumbs. Set the breaded cutlets aside for a few minutes. Heat the oil in a skillet, then lay each breaded cutlet in the hot fat. Cook for 2 minutes on each side or until the crumb coating has turned golden brown. You want the cutlets to be pink inside, so be careful not to overcook them. Drain them on paper towels and place on a serving dish.</p>

<p class="nonindent">It cannot be denied that kebabs of tender chunks of marinated and lightly charred lamb are always a pleasing prospect. Yet when served on top of emerald green fava beans with a zingy lemony dressing, this dish takes on elegance far beyond the common kebab.</p>
<p class="hanging01">juice and zest of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 cup olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">1/4 cup finely chopped fresh mint leaves</p>
<p class="hanging">1/4 cup finely chopped fresh parsley</p>
<p class="hanging">10 oz. lamb fillet, cut into 3/4–inch cubes</p>
<p class="hanging02">1 cup shelled fava beans</p>
<p class="nonindent">In a deep bowl, whisk together half the lemon juice and zest, half the olive oil, and salt and pepper, until the mixture is emulsified. Add half the herbs and then toss the lamb through the mixture. Let marinate for at least 2 hours, but preferably overnight.</p>
<p class="extract">Bring a deep pan of salted water to a boil, add the fava beans, and cook for 3 minutes until the beans are soft. Drain, and when cool enough to handle, remove the tough outer skins. Place in a bowl and pour in the remaining olive oil, lemon juice and zest, and herbs. Season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="extract">Thread 3 or 4 chunks of meat onto each of 4 skewers. On a very hot grill or griddle pan, cook the meat, turning every 30 seconds, until done. Place each kebab on a small serving of zesty fava beans and serve immediately.</p>

<p class="nonindent">In a food processor, pulse all the ingredients except the lamb and oil, until you get a coarse mixture.
