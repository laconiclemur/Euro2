 Introduction</h2>
<p class="para1">
<strong>Georgia is a country built on traditions and of these food is perhaps the most important. Family life revolves around the dining table, and when I was growing up, my family, especially on my father’s side, took their food very seriously indeed. My grandmother was like a kitchen magician, conjuring up unforgettably delicious food from the ingredients available to her — she used seasonal ingredients, even through the difficult times when the food supply was erratic. But no matter what challenges she faced, there was always something delicious on the table and plenty to go around, even if friends and neighbours came by unannounced, as they often did. It has become a cliché to talk about one’s grandmother, but the reality is that she fostered a love of food and entertaining in me that has remained with me throughout my life and made me the person that I am.</strong>

<strong>The memory of my life in Georgia is so intense and such an irreplaceable part of me that familiar smells can instantly take me back to my early childhood; the smells of the seasons and of seasonal food are also the smells of my youth. Leaving these memories behind and coming to another country felt like I was a traveller in a physical body leaving her spirit behind.</strong>

<strong>Luckily, I had the opportunity to open my restaurant, Little Georgia, in London. Within its walls I have created a little homeland and can bring these never-forgotten senses from my old home to my new one. As I mentioned, eating together is a big part of family life in Georgia. Our families are very large and very close, with distant cousins counting as very close relations. We love parties so much that we can always find a reason to celebrate. If a neighbour’s cousin’s dog had a puppy we would laugh and celebrate with a feast until dawn.</strong>

<strong>This love for entertaining and the spontaneity of celebration is hard to come by in London. In Georgia, the door was always open and our house was always full of guests, laughing, singing and debating around a table which was groaning under the weight of seemingly endless dishes. These parties were not planned; they just happened and yet there was always food and drink to satisfy the appetite of every impromptu visitor.</strong>

 I can remember so clearly, as if I had just heard it a moment ago, the comments that our guests made about the food we served them. Even simple salads made by my grandmother were very special. Looking back, I understand now that what was motivating her was a love of watching people enjoying her food, as much as I loved watching her in the kitchen.</strong>

<strong>Writing this book has brought back so many memories. <em>Supra</em>
 or ‘feast’, is an integral part of our culture. I cannot escape the memories that flow in my mind from back home of when with nature waking up in spring time the people also seemed to come alive — late night parties, with loud singing, in their gardens. My balcony overlooked the garden of a famous Georgian comedian and actor who had a wooden hut in his garden where he would entertain his guests with parties until sunrise. The smell of baking and barbecue, and the raucous sounds of singing and toasting would waft up through my open windows. Famous poets reciting their works and telling stories, real stories, to a captive and respectful audience. These were not just parties, but celebrations of life — all that is fine about it — in a traditional, dignified and always philosophical manner. When I listened to these people speak, their words were pervaded with wisdom and grace that helped to shape me as a person. If asked what was the smell of my country, I would say spring. And what does spring smell like? Joy. The feeling of eternity and the nonexistence of sorrow.</strong>

<strong>For me, these memories are a big bottle of love that guides me through misery, grief and hard times. Love is the strongest weapon I was given by my family and it is the strongest weapon that you can hold. I have been very fortunate to have all this and through this book, I hope to share it with you.</strong>
