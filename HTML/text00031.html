</h1>
<p class="pf">I was a country kid. I worked in the field. I shoveled manure. I rode the bus to school. I smelled like barn when I got to school. I guess I didn’t even know—or care—to envy those who were privileged to be able to walk to school every day. I wore hand-me-downs from “rich” people in Duluth. I was perfectly happy with my lot in life. My home was a beautiful place with woods and streams and wildflowers and wild strawberries. We had a great rhythm of life—work all week, clean house on Saturdays, and then enjoy the fresh smell of clean sheets and feel squeaky clean after sauna.</p>
<p>When I got to the age when I was dating, I found kids with similar values, not in Floodwood, but in towns like Meadowlands and Toivola that were a few miles away on Highway 73. I dated a boy named Floyd when I was fifteen years old. Our relationship was purely platonic, but we had so much fun together and with the gang of country kids who were all so full of crazy ideas.</p>
<p>Floyd and the gang would pick me up on a typical Saturday night, and we’d go to the show (movie) in Floodwood, and then with six of us in his Buick, we’d drive back to Meadowlands to have a glass of milk and a glazed doughnut at Berweger’s Café. Sometimes, just for the fun of it, the boys would put a two-quart bottle of 7Up in a creek to chill, midway between Floodwood and Meadowlands. We’d stop and all drink from that bottle. What fun!</p>
<p>One year, around 1950, the tent caterpillar outbreak was huge and the roads were covered with swarms of the wriggling worms. Not only that, they crawled up the walls of homes and filled ditches. They made country roads so slippery that when you slammed on the brakes, the car would slide from one side to another.</p>
<p>The guys would dare each other to eat the worms. Floyd, of course, did and earned his daredevil crown. Country kid macho! Us girls would squeal with disgust.</p>
<p>One Saturday evening, when Floyd showed up, his face was lobster red. He explained that he had had a contest with the hired men on his father’s farm to see who could stand the largest number of ladles of water on the hot sauna stove. (Remember, Finns always take a sauna on Saturday evening.) Each ladle of water thrown onto the hot rocks produces an incredible swoosh of steam. Although the temperature of the room goes down, the steam makes it feel hotter. Floyd won the battle. Who says country kids can’t have fun?</p>

<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Country Carrot Meatloaf</a>
</p>
<p class="rpf">Meatloaf was a standard dish in our home and is still one of my favorite things to have on hand for snacks, sandwiches, and other quick meals. When we had ground venison, we used that. Later, on a graduate student’s budget, I devised this recipe to “extend” the meat while adding a vegetable too—grated carrots actually added not just flavor and nutrition to the meatloaf, but succulent moistness, too.</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpilf">1 cup bread crumbs, made from 2 slices firm homemade bread</p>
<p class="rpil">¾ cup milk</p>
<p class="rpil">2 large carrots, shredded</p>
<p class="rpil">1 medium onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="rpil">2½ pounds lean ground beef, venison, or bison</p>
<p class="rpil">3 eggs</p>
<p class="rpil">1 tablespoon salt</p>
<p class="rpil">¼ teaspoon pepper</p>
</div>
<p class="rph1">For the glaze</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpil">¼ cup catsup</p>
<p class="rpil">3 tablespoons brown sugar</p>
<p class="rpill">2 tablespoons prepared mustard</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">Preheat the oven to 350°F.</p>
<p class="rp">In a large bowl, combine the bread crumbs and milk. Add the carrots, onion, beef, eggs, salt, and pepper.</p>
<p class="rp">With an electric hand mixer, or by hand, which takes longer, mix all of the ingredients well. Pat into a 9- by 5-inch loaf pan.</p>
<p class="rp">In a small bowl, mix the catsup, brown sugar, and mustard well and spread evenly over the top of the meatloaf. Bake, uncovered, for 1 to 1½ hours.</p>
<p class="rpy">Makes 8 servings</p>
