<p class="author1"><span class="txit">ossobuco con verdurine e funghi</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Excellent stews and braised meats require patience, so cooking them in the oven, where it is easier to maintain uniform heat, is the preferred method in our family. The oven heat allows the meat to simmer very gently, so it holds to the bone and does not fall apart. For a truly rich flavor, prepare this <span class="txit">ossobuco</span> a day ahead, refrigerate it overnight, and reheat in the oven the next day.</p>
<p class="indentb">When shopping for veal shanks, request ones cut from the center. These have more meat and less bone. Ask the butcher to securely tie the meat so it does not fall off the bone. Serve accompanied by <a class="nounder" href="ach99.html#page_194">Milanese Risotto</a>, <a class="nounder" href="ach101.html#page_198">Risotto with Vegetables and Fine Herbs</a>, gnocchi (potato or semolina), or mashed potatoes.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">6 pieces center-cut veal shank (8 to 10 ounces each, 1 to 1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> inches thick)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, plus additional for dusting</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 tablespoons canola oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon butter</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup finely sliced celery</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup finely diced carrots</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup finely diced onions</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup dry white wine</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup dried porcini mushrooms, soaked for at least 15 minutes in 1 cup warm water</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 teaspoon plus 1 tablespoon finely chopped sage leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 teaspoon plus 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cups drained and chopped canned whole plum tomatoes</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 cups chicken broth or water</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon finely chopped lemon zest</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_259"/><span class="red">1.</span> Preheat the oven to 350° F.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Dust the veal with flour, shaking off any excess. Season with salt and pepper. Warm 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large flameproof casserole or sauté pan set over medium-high heat. Cook the veal, browning it evenly on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer the meat to a platter and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Drain off any juices remaining in the pan. Place the pan over medium-high heat and melt the butter in the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. When the butter begins to foam, add the celery, carrots, and onions. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables have softened but not browned, about 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Return the veal to the pan, along with any juices that have accumulated on the plate. Stir in the 3 tablespoons flour, then add the wine. Remove the mushrooms from the water, reserving the water. Squeeze the mushrooms gently to remove excess moisture, coarsely chop them, and add them to the pan. Bring to a boil and cook to sweeten the wine, about 1 minute.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> Reduce the heat to a simmer and add 1 teaspoon of the sage, 1 teaspoon of the rosemary, the chopped tomatoes, and the chicken broth. Strain the mushroom water through a fine-mesh sieve or coffee filter and add to the pan. Season with salt and pepper. Slowly return the liquid to a boil, shaking the pan to combine all the ingredients. Transfer to the oven and cook until the meat feels soft when gently probed, about 1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> hours.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">6.</span> Just before serving, combine the remaining tablespoon each sage and rosemary and the lemon zest. Sprinkle this mixture over the individual portions of the veal shank.</p>
