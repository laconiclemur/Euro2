<h2 class="h2b">BETTERAVE ROTIE AU FROMAGE DE CHEVRE</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Roasted Beetroot with Fresh Goats’ Cheese</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>To be able to buy pre-cooked beetroot in our local Provençal markets has been a wonderful discovery. I can waive the hour or so that’s needed to boil or bake a big beetroot, and peel and use them straightaway, making them a much more practical proposition for everyday eating. They are at their best when just picked from July to September. I’ve found to my great delight that slicing and roasting them has won over many friends who said they’d always disliked beets but would just try one to keep me happy. When roasted and caramelised, almost dry around the outside and melting in the middle, the flavour marries perfectly with creamy fresh goats’ cheese and spicy rocket</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
2 large cooked beetroot, about 800g (1lb 12oz)<br/>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>
4 tbsp groundnut oil<br/>
200g (7oz) fresh goats’ cheese (Biscaron, St. Maure, anything creamy)<br/>
1 bunch rocket<br/>
100g (3½oz) semi-dried tomatoes<br/>
100ml (3½fl oz) olive oil<br/>
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 190°C/375°F/Gas 5.</p>
<p class="normala">Cut each beetroot in half, then each half into six wedges. Lay these flat on a tray just large enough to hold them, season them well and pour over the oil. Roast the beetroot for 15 minutes each side.</p>
<p class="normala">You can either serve them straightaway or at room temperature. In either case, chop the goats’ cheese into chunks and slice the rocket. Scatter these and the whole semi-dried tomatoes over the top of the beetroot wedges. Drizzle with the olive oil and vinegar, grind over plenty of pepper, and serve.</p>
