<h5 class="h5"><a id="pageid_168"/><b>Warm White Asparagus Salad</b> <span class="smfont">with</span> <b>Grapefruit Zest Vinaigrette</b></h5>
<p class="normal"><b>In France, we could almost change our national day to White Asparagus Day. Well, almost, but not quite! But when white asparagus comes into season, you will find it on all the tables at home, in restaurants, bistros, brasseries and auberges—it will be on every menu for that short season. I love it. It’s just superb. Here, I am serving it with white grapefruit and a boiled egg and grapefruit dressing that complements the white asparagus perfectly. If you like, you can also serve it with crusty bread and my Belgian Endive and Radish Salad (see <a href="015_9781848991583_Recipe9.html">page 19</a>) alongside.</b></p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">SERVES</span></b> 4</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 25 minutes, plus making the mayonnaise</p>
<p class="acktxta"><span class="smallcaps"><b>COOKING TIME</b></span> 20 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 egg</p>
<p class="acktxt">2¼ pounds white asparagus, peeled and woody ends discarded</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 white grapefruit</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 teaspoons Mayonnaise (see <a href="011_9781848991583_Recipe5.html#pageid_18">page 18</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">6 tablespoons sunflower oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 teaspoon chopped chervil leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Bring a saucepan of water to a boil over medium heat. Add the egg and return the water to a boil, then turn the heat down to low and simmer 10 minutes. Drain and cool the egg under running cold water, then crack and peel it. Finely chop the egg yolk and white and leave to one side.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Divide the asparagus into 4 equal bunches and tie each bunch with kitchen string to secure. Bring a large pan of salted water to a boil over medium heat. Add the bunched asparagus and simmer 5 to 8 minutes, depending on the size of your asparagus, until it is tender but with just a little resistance when pierced with the tip of a knife.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Grate the zest from the grapefruit, reserve a pinch and put the rest in a small bowl. Peel the grapefruit, then take out 4 segments and cut each segment in half and leave to one side. Juice the rest of the grapefruit, pressing it through a fine strainer into the bowl with the zest. Add the mustard and mayonnaise and whisk together until well blended, then whisk in the sunflower oil in a steady stream. Stir in the chopped egg and chervil and season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Remove the asparagus from the pan and drain quickly on paper towels or a clean dish towel. Remove the string and put the asparagus onto serving plates. Spoon the dressing over the top and finish with the reserved grapefruit segments and a sprinkling of the reserved zest.</p>

<h6 class="h6k"><a id="pageid_170"/>SMOKING FOOD</h6>
<p class="normalx">I am a big fan of smoked foods, particularly meat, as I just love those smoky flavors. Although smoking was developed as a way of preserving food, I think it is more about the wonderful flavors it creates. Originally—going back to ancient times—people used to hang their kill to dry in their caves. Since there was no way out for the smoke from the fire, they noticed that both the flavor and the preserving qualities were improved by the smoke … and so it began!</p>
<p class="normalx">Since then, smoking foods, usually over wood smoke, has become popular in many regions of the world and has developed commercially. In particular, smokehouses were built on farms to preserve meat—well away from the farm buildings to avoid fire spreading if an accident happened—and on the coasts, to be handy for the fishermen landing their catch.</p>
<p class="normalx">The first commercial smoker here in the UK was set up in Scotland in 1939. Much later, when I worked in Scotland, there was a small smokehouse just down the road from us, which I used to drive past every day. Those memories will stay with me for ever, as I can still vividly recall the delightful smell of the burning wood.</p>
<p class="normalx">Where I come from in Franche-Comté, smoking foods has always been a specialty and the technique is still very much alive today. On market day, I often used to go shopping with my mom or my sister, Dolores. They were both very good cooks—although that goes without saying in my family, as we are all enthusiastic gourmands. Anyway, you will see throughout this book, I like to use products from my home area, and one of those is Morteau, a delicious smoked sausage. We often bought this from the market, along with smoked pork shoulder (Boston butt), bacon or neck. To serve with it, Mom used to make sauerkraut with turnip instead of cabbage. That day was one day we all looked forward to.</p>
<p class="normalx2"><b>At The Vineyard</b></p>
<p class="normalxk">We serve some smoked dishes in my restaurant. My friend, John, has supplied our smoked salmon, haddock and mackerel for the past twenty years and, trust me, he is very good at smoking! I also love to use other smoked ingredients, like smoked paprika and, of course, Morteau sausage. But we also do some smoking ourselves; my particular favorites are smoked beets, which have a wonderful earthy flavor, to serve as a side dish or as part of a salad, and smoked duck, a meat that seems perfect to prepare in this way.</p>
<p class="normalx2"><b>Foods for smoking</b></p>
<p class="normalxk">All kinds of poultry and meat can be smoked, creating a range of products from spiced pastrami to smoked bacon. Smoked fish ranges from cod or haddock to salmon, herring or mackerel. Tofu and cheeses absorb fabulous flavors in the smoker, as do nuts, vegetables like peppers and beets and fruit like prunes, which are often smoked while drying. Teas, such as lapsang souchong, and even some Scotch whiskies are smoked. It is important to remember, though, there are various methods of smoking and not all act as a preservative.</p>
<p class="normalx2"><b>Hot and cold smoking</b></p>
<p class="normalxk">Whatever their size, smokers create heat and smoke by burning wood chips or sawdust, or they might have gas burners. Here in the UK, where I am cooking, oak or alder are the woods of choice in most smokehouses, as well as beech and fruit-tree woods, such as apple. In the USA, corncobs are popular, while in New Zealand, they like to burn the wood from the manuka tree. Some smokers also have steam coils to create humidity and maintain the correct temperature, which is obviously crucial or the results will be dry and flavorless.</p>
<p class="normalx">Hot smoking uses both smoke and heat in a wood-fired oven, a smoke-roaster or even a barbecue. The temperature reaches 125° to 176°F so, at the higher temperatures, the food is cooked as well as absorbing the smoky flavors.</p>
<p class="normalx"><a id="pageid_171"/>Cold smoking does not cook the food, because the temperature of 62° to 68°F only imparts the wood-smoke flavor, so many cold-smoked foods are cured in brine first. For our smoked recipes, I’m using a method based on a Chinese technique known as tea smoking, because a combination of rice, tea and sugar is used to create the smoke. We’ll then cook our smoke-flavored foods afterward. (I decided that the Icelandic tradition of smoking fish over dried sheep’s dung was perhaps not one to try at home!)</p>
<p class="normalx2"><b>How it’s done</b></p>
<p class="normalxk">I hope you will try this method. You can buy smokers in packaged sets and there is a vast range of different wood chips available online for you to try. I recommend, however, you use my tea-smoking option first, because you can simply adapt your steamer or wok.</p>
<p class="normalx" style="margin-bottom:0em;">Just one reminder. Do be careful of the heat and smoke, especially when disposing of the smoking ingredients—they’ll stay hot for a while even after you take them off the heat. Please do not burn yourself.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindent">•  You need a steamer with a lid, or a wok with a lid and a metal rack, and some aluminum foil.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindent">•  Your smoking mixture is ½ cup basmati rice, 2 tablespoons green tea and 2 teaspoons sugar.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindent">•  Prepare the food as if cooking it conventionally, so trimmed, pitted, left whole or sliced or whatever is necessary.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindent">•  Put a large piece of aluminum foil, shiny-side down, in the bottom of a steamer or wok. Put the rice, tea and sugar on the foil, cover with a steamer insert or a wire rack, then put on the lid. Put over medium heat about 5 minutes until the mixture starts smoking.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindent">•  Quickly lift the lid and put the food onto the rack. Put the lid back on, turn the heat down to low and smoke for the time recommended in the recipe; that’s usually about 5 minutes for chicken or duck pieces.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindent">•  Lift out the food and put it on a plate to rest.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindent">•  Wrap the smoking ingredients in the foil and discard them carefully. Again, take care not to burn yourself.</p>
<p class="normalx">Leave the food to cool, or continue cooking it, following the recipe instructions, then savor those stunning flavors. Try smoking a cod fillet following the method below, or try Smoked Duck and Lentils with Lavender (see <a href="102_9781848991583_Recipe93.html#pageid_154">page 154</a>) or Smoked Chicken, Zucchini, Garlic and Rosemary Casserole (see <a href="112_9781848991583_Recipe103.html#pageid_174">page 174</a>).</p>
<p class="normalx2"><b>Fennel-smoked Cod with Warm Bean Salad</b></p>
<p class="normalxk">When you smoke fish with herbs, such as fennel, the subtle scent permeates the fish to complement the lovely smoky flavor. Try this simple cod recipe.</p>
<p class="normalx">Add a pinch of dried fennel to the smoking mixture (left) in the foil-lined wok, then put 2 very fresh pieces of cod, in the smoker, skin-side down, and season with salt and pepper, cover the wok and smoke 5 minutes. Remove the cod from the smoker and brush the skin with a little olive oil. Heat a skillet over medium heat, then pan-fry the cod, skin-side down, about 5 minutes until the skin is crisp and golden brown. Flip it on the other side and cook 2 minutes longer to finish it off. Cool and discard the smoking ingredients.</p>
<p class="normalx">The perfect accompiment is a warm white bean salad. Gently warm 1½ cups cooked white beans in a pan with 1 or 2 diced oven-dried tomatoes and a chopped garlic clove. Take the pan off the heat and stir in 2 teaspoons chopped parsley leaves, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and top with your smoked cod fillet to serve. You should be in paradise! Can I join you for dinner?</p>
