    <p class="nonindent1_break"><a id="page159"/><span class="C_COTX"><span class="dk_blue">There is a small family farm</span></span> in eastern Iceland that has been owned by the same family for generations. The cows are lovingly looked after by <a id="ind642a"/>Vigdís Sveinbjörnsdóttir and her husband, <a id="ind303a"/>Herdís Jónsson, whose farming lineage stretches back longer than anyone can trace. Passing on a family tradition is a common occurrence in Iceland, but as the younger generations yearn for more urban lifestyles, there is the constant fear that farms such as <a id="ind350a"/>Landbunadur will disappear. The husband-and-wife team produces both beef and <a id="ind221a"/><a id="ind169a"/>dairy products, such as skyr and butter, which they serve at the small café and visitor’s center at the entrance to the farm.</p>
<p class="extract">They want people to fall in love with the taste of beef and <a id="ind378a"/>milk that has been produced from cows that are allowed to roam freely in the countryside, where they fortify themselves on the pesticide-free grasses and hay that flourish in the spring and summer months. They also hope that one of their three children will fall enough in love with farm life to forgo a career elsewhere and instead take over the farm, ensuring its survival.</p>
<p class="extract">Dairy farmers in Iceland face the same issues that many dairy farmers around the world face. They are required to pasteurize their milk, rather than sell it raw to the general consumer, and they must send it to a regional facility, where it is processed collectively with the rest of the milk in the area. Vigdís chooses to sell as much of the farm’s dairy production as she can at her café, so that guests to the farm have the opportunity to taste products, such as butter and skyr, produced solely from the farm’s milk.</p>
<p class="extract">This is the only way that people are able to taste the unique <em>terroir</em> of the farm—a <em>terroir</em> that Vigdís worries will be lost if her children decide to leave the land. For now, the family continues to raise its cows with the same love and integrity that past generations showed their charges.</p>
<h2 class="A2" id="c07-s48"><a id="page160"/><span class="dk_blue">A Conversation with Dairy Farmer Vigdís Sveinbjörnsdóttir</span></h2>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Have you always been a dairy farm?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">This farm has been in my husband’s family for generations and used to be a sheep farm, as well. But in the late 1980s, it became strictly a dairy and beef farm. It was due to a disease that broke out in this area, and while our sheep were not infected, they were slaughtered anyway as a precaution to prevent further outbreaks. No one in this area was allowed to have sheep for five years. We were compensated for it, but following that period, we decided to convert solely to a dairy and beef farm.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> How many dairy cows do you have?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">We have room for seventy-two dairy cows but right now we have seventy. We are close to maximum capacity.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> What do you produce?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">We produce around thirty tons of beef each year and also quite a bit of dairy, which we sell as both milk and skyr. We sell our cattle to local farmers who slaughter them for us and distribute our beef, but I also buy some of it back to sell in our store at the farm. I don’t make a lot of money on this, but I like knowing that we are selling beef that is of the highest quality and was treated in a humane way.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Whom do you sell your milk to?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">We sell it to a local collection plant that processes our milk with the rest of the milk in the region. In Iceland, we are not allowed to sell <a id="ind380a"/>raw milk. It must be pasteurized and then processed in a controlled facility with milk from other farms. We pasteurize the milk ourselves. The pasteurization requirement was introduced in the 1950s, and the policy has not changed. We drink raw milk at home, but unfortunately it is illegal to sell it to the general public.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> <a id="page161"/>What are the biggest challenges that you face?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">The weather is one of the biggest challenges that every Icelandic farmer faces. It is so unpredictable, and because it is, some years are much more successful and productive than others. That means we must plan for hard times long before they happen or we won’t survive from year to year. This is the story of Iceland and its people and has been ever since the land was settled.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Were you affected by the economic crisis?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">Farmers on the whole were the first to have the interest rates on their loans increased to begin paying back the newly incurred national debt, which hurt farmers in general a great deal. Fortunately, we did not have large loans, so the rates did not affect us. But the governments also lowered the subsidies farmers received for their products, and this affected all farmers, including us. All Icelanders are expected to help pay off the national debt, which can be frustrating because we were not personally responsible for it. But it’s the reality and you have to face it, deal with it, and move on without letting it affect you too much or you will not be able to move forward with your work and your life.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Where do you sell your dairy products?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">I only sell our dairy products on the farm, because the main purpose of producing milk is to bring people here to experience the life of the farm, to see the animals, and to understand where their milk comes from. Always buying something prepackaged in the store breaks the connection between the farmer and the consumer, and we are trying to reconcile it. In the summer months, we have many visitors, which is encouraging.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> How many people do you employ at the farm?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">There are only two of us along with my daughter, who takes care of the cows in the summer. I have three children, and they all have other plans for their lives. But they also want this farm to endure, so either they have to do something about it or let it go. Hopefully, they are all planning to do something about it in order to keep it in the family. Sometimes it seems their other plans are getting in the way, but we always remind them that if that happens, we will have to sell the farm. I have hope that at least one of them will decide to keep it going.</p>
<h2 class="Recipe_Title" id="c07-s49"><a id="page162"/><span class="dk_blue">SKYR</span></h2>
<div class="yield"><a id="ind570a"/>MAKES 5 POUNDS (2.3 KG) WITH <a id="ind662a"/>WHEY, JUST OVER 2½ POUNDS (1.1 KG) WITHOUT WHEY <span class="yield_pipe">|</span> PREPARATION TIME: ABOUT 1 HOUR (PLUS 30 MINUTES TO COOL TO ROOM TEMPERATURE AND 12 TO 15 HOURS TO SET)</div>
<div class="headnote1" id="c07-h001">Skyr, a thick and creamy cheese that is similar in flavor and texture to Greek yogurt, is a fundamental ingredient in Icelandic cuisine, and virtually every home refrigerator in the country holds a container of it (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_bm1_r1.htm#bm1-K1">for more information</a>).</div>
<div class="headnote_indent">The healthful, flavorful whey that remains after draining the milk is used in several recipes in this book. The “old skyr” called for here is similar to a sourdough starter, in that it carries the active yeasts and bacteria from the region in which it was first produced. You do not need the starter to make skyr, but it is a good idea to keep a little each time to incorporate into the next batch. Once you see how easy it is to make skyr, it might become as fundamental to your diet as it is that of an Icelander.</div>
<div class="ingredient">
<p class="IL_item"><strong>10½ cups (2½ L) skim milk</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>2 tablespoons old skyr, if available (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-h001">see headnote</a>)</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">In a nonstick saucepan (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-note29">see note</a>), heat the milk over low heat to 200°F (95°C) and keep it at this temperature for 10 minutes. It’s crucial to keep the temperature steady, not allowing it to drop below or rise above, or the skyr will either scorch or not set properly. Stir the milk throughout this process to prevent it from sticking on the pan bottom. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside at room temperature. Let cool to 102°F (39°C). This entire process takes a substantial amount of time, over 1 hour to heat the milk and almost 30 minutes for it to cool to room temperature.</div>
<div class="method">Add the old skyr, if using and whisk until well blended. Cover with a kitchen towel and let stand at room temperature for 12 to 15 hours (up to 24 hours), until thickened to the consistency of Greek yogurt and the curds have separated from the whey.</div>
<div class="method">At this point, you can either stir the whey into the skyr to thin it, or drain the skyr through cheesecloth for a thicker consistency. Cover tightly and refrigerate until chilled. The skyr, either thinned with the whey or strained, will keep in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. The whey will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</div>
<div class="note" id="c07-note29">
<p class="note_head"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>NOTES</strong></span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">A nonstick pan will prevent the skyr from scorching during the lengthy time it takes to heat it up and keep it at temperature. If you do not have a nonstick pan, a regular heavy saucepan will work, but you must be prepared to monitor the skyr closely throughout the entire process.</span></p>

<div class="yield">SERVES 4 <span class="yield_pipe">|</span> PREPARATION TIME: ABOUT 1 HOUR (PLUS 3 TO 4 HOURS TO CHILL THE CUSTARD)</div>
<div class="headnote"><em><a id="ind1a"/>Áabrystir</em> (colostrum), the first milk produced after a cow gives birth, is one of the Icelandic products that is virtually impossible to source outside of the country. It is buttercup yellow and loaded with fat, vitamins and minerals, and flavor. Gunnar says it’s like an instant crème anglaise without the hassle. Unfortunately, it’s only sold at traditional markets in Iceland. That means that most of the rest of the world will have to make due with heavy cream thickened with gelatin, which makes a fine substitute. The custard is a good way to conclude a meal, especially when paired with macerated blueberries and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.</div>
<div class="ingredient">
<p class="IL_head_top"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>CUSTARD</strong></span></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1½ cups (360 ml) heavy cream</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1 sheet gelatin, soaked in cold water to cover until softened, then squeezed to remove excess water</strong></p>
<p class="IL_head"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>BLUEBERRIES</strong></span></p>

<p class="IL_item"><strong>2½ tablespoons Demerara sugar</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>2¼ teaspoons ground cinnamon</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">To make the custard, set up a bain-marie. Place a wide saucepan on the stove top and put a heatproof bowl in the pan. Add the cream to the bowl, pour water into the pan to reach halfway up the sides of the bowl, and turn on the heat to medium-low. Heat the cream to 158°F (70°C). This will take about 18 minutes.</div>
<div class="method">Add the gelatin to the warm cream and stir to dissolve completely. Transfer the cream to 4 ramekins, each 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter, and let cool slightly. Cover each custard with plastic wrap pressed directly onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming and refrigerate for 3 to 4 hours, until chilled and set. (It may take longer if the ramekins are deep.)</div>
<div class="method">To make the blueberries, in a bowl, toss together the blueberries and sugar until the blueberries are fully coated. Set aside at room temperature for 30 minutes before serving to soften and sweeten the berries.</div>
<div class="method">To make the cinnamon sugar, in a small bowl, combine the sugar and cinnamon until incorporated.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, top the ramekins with the blueberries and sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar.</div>

<div class="headnote">The fried pork skin in this recipe is feather light and addictively crunchy, and when dipped into the tangy skyr and sprinkled with rosemary salt, it becomes a tempting indulgence. Most of the preparation time is devoted to the inactive steps of simmering, chilling, and dehydrating, so don’t let the large number of hours scare you away from what has the potential to become a go- to game-day indulgence. Rosemary pairs particularly well with the skyr, but herbs such as thyme, tarragon, or savory make fine substitutes. To seriously pursue the juniper theme and embrace your inner Icelander, replace the herbs altogether with the needles from a 3-inch (7.5-cm) pine twig. Just be sure to rinse the needles well under ice-cold running water to remove excess sap and residue before using.</div>

<p class="IL_item"><strong>2 juniper berries, ground to a powder</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">To make the rosemary salt, in a spice grinder, combine the rosemary and salt and grind until evenly ground and almost a powder.</div>
<div class="method">To make the pork skin, place the skin in a saucepan, add water to cover by 3 inches (7.5 cm), and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Boil uncovered, adding water as needed to keep the skin covered, for about 2 hours, until tender.</div>
<div class="method">Remove from the heat and let stand for about 45 minutes. At this point, the skin should be cool enough to handle. Drain it and, using a razor blade, gently scrape off any hair and fat from the skin. (Any hair will scorch and any fat will splatter when you deep-fry the skin.) Cut the skin into playing card–size pieces and refrigerate the skin in an airtight container for 1½ hours.</div>
<div class="method">Preheat a dehydrator to 147°F (64°C). Arrange the skin on a dehydrator tray and dehydrate for 12 hours, until completely dry.</div>
<div class="method">Pour oil to a depth of 2½ inches (6 cm) into a heavy, deep pot and heat to 320°F (160°C). Working in batches, add the skin pieces to the hot oil and fry for about 30 seconds, until <a id="page166"/><a id="ind356a"/>they puff up. Using a slotted spoon or wire skimmer, transfer them to paper towels to drain, then sprinkle with the rosemary salt. Repeat with the remaining skin pieces.</div>
<div class="method">To make the juniper skyr, combine the honey, vinegar, and rosemary in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat, cover with aluminum foil, and let stand at room temperature for 10 minutes (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-note30">see notes</a>). Prepare an ice bath.</div>
<div class="method">Strain the liquid into a bowl and nest the bowl in the ice bath until the liquid is well chilled. In a bowl, whisk together the skyr and juniper, then whisk in the chilled liquid. Cover and refrigerate until chilled.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, set out the puffed <a id="ind467a"/>pork skin with bowls of the juniper skyr for dipping and the rosemary salt for sprinkling.</div>

<p class="Essays_header"><span class="dk_blue">PORK IN ICELAND</span></p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">The first settlers in Iceland introduced pigs along with goats, cows, chickens, sheep and horses. By the sixteenth century, pigs had become extinct, however, and were not introduced again until the nineteenth century. As a result, few traditional pork recipes exist from the earliest days. But since its reintroduction, pork has become a darling of both chefs and home cooks and holds a prominent place on the Icelandic table.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">It is especially appreciated on special occasions like Christmas, when some families enjoy pork belly with crispy skin studded with aromatics such as juniper, cloves, and bay leaves.</p>

<p class="Essays_header"><span class="dk_blue">BEER IN ICELAND</span></p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">The tradition of cultivating barley in Iceland died out in the Middle Ages and with it went Iceland’s earliest beer traditions. Beer was reintroduced a few hundred years later on a limited scale. Then, in 1915, all alcoholic beverages were banned in Iceland, a prohibition that continued until 1935, when the restriction was lifted on all beverages except beer. The prohibition against beer remained in force until 1989, when its consumption was finally legalized. As a result, the first beers made in Iceland in recent times were simple pilsners and ales, with Viking and Gull being standout brands.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">In recent years, with the advent of Iceland’s culinary renaissance, brewers are becoming more creative, as they look to their native ingredients for inspiration. Arctic thyme, angelica, and sorrel are emerging in new types of Icelandic beer, such as porters, stouts, Indian pale ales, and red ales. It’s an exciting time to be a brewer in Iceland, and an exciting time to be a beer drinker, too.</p>

Freyja is not only the revered goddess of love, beauty, war, and death in Norse mythology but is also the name of Gunnar’s lovely wife. Any high-quality wheat beer is a good substitute for the Icelandic brew. Malt is another important ingredient in Iceland, where locals so appreciate the flavor that the carbonated beverage Maltextrakt, made by Egils, is available throughout the country. Malt extract is used in this recipe, and when incorporated into cream, it creates a delicious dip. The crispy oats, a fun spin on humdrum porridge, are the perfect vehicle for it.</div>

<div class="method">To make the cottage cheese, combine the cottage cheese and sour cream and mix well. Season with salt and vinegar, cover, and refrigerate until chilled.</div>
<div class="method">To make the spicy nuts, preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Spread all of the nuts on a baking sheet and toast in the oven for 7 to 8 minutes, until golden brown. While the nuts are still warm, put them in a kitchen towel and then rub them between your palms to remove the skins. Finely chop the nuts and let cool to room temperature.</div>
<div class="method">Combine the clove, fennel seeds, dill seeds, and star anise in a small frying pan over medium-low heat and toast, shaking the pan often, for 5 to 6 minutes, until fragrant and nicely toasted. Remove from the heat, stir in the cinnamon, and let cool to room temperature. Transfer to a spice grinder and grind to a fine powder.

<div class="headnote1">This dessert is a fun conversation piece for guests who will be dazzled by the unexpected appearance of birch in many of the elements. A few years ago, Gunnar and one of his business partners, <a id="ind424a"/>Ólafur Örn Ólafsson, started distilling a birch schnapps called Birkir and a liqueur called Björk in conjunction with the artisanal spirits maker <a id="ind252a"/>Foss Distillery. It’s just one of many artisanal spirits emerging in recent years.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent">The meringue could take a bit longer to set than indicated, depending on the humidity level where you live, but give it time and it will firm up for you.

<div class="method">To make the birch meringue, preheat a dehydrator to the lowest setting (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-note32">see notes</a>). Line a dehydrator tray with a nonstick baking mat. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg white powder and water until aerated, then transfer to the small bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whip attachment (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-note32">see notes</a>). Add the schnapps and whip on high speed until light and frothy. Still on high speed, add the sugar in a slow, steady stream until incorporated, then continue to whip until stiff peaks form, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.</div>
<div class="method">Transfer the egg white mixture to a piping bag fitted with a 1-inch (2.5-cm) plain tip and pipe lines 2 inches (5 cm) long onto the lined tray. Dehydrate for about 12 hours (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-note32">see notes</a>), until the mixture is the texture of meringue. The meringue will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week. Break into pieces just before serving.</div>
<div class="method"><a id="page175"/>To make the dried birch, preheat the dehydrator to the lowest setting (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-note32">see notes</a>). Spread the birch leaves on a dehydrator tray and dehydrate for about 12 hours, until dry. Transfer to a spice grinder and pulse to a fine powder.</div>
<div class="method">To make the granita, combine the water and sugar in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat, add the birch, and let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a shallow container. Place in the freezer for 30 minutes. Remove from the freezer, rake and stir the granita thoroughly with a fork, and return to the freezer. Repeat this process every 30 minutes for 4 to 6 hours, until the mixture is frozen and the consistency of granita.</div>
<div class="method">To make the pudding, pour half of the buttermilk into the stand mixer fitted with the whip attachment and the remaining half into a saucepan. Sprinkle the gelatin over the buttermilk in the pan and let stand for 3 to 5 minutes, until it blooms. Place the pan over low heat and heat, stirring frequently, just until fully dissolved. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature.</div>
<div class="method">Whip the other half of the buttermilk on medium speed for about 3 minutes, until frothy. Add the almonds, sugar, and skyr and whip until incorporated, about 2 minutes more. Add the buttermilk-gelatin mixture and whip for 1 minute. Add the whipped cream and whip just until incorporated. Transfer to a 9-inch (23-cm) round nonstick cake pan and refrigerate for about 4 hours, until chilled and firmly set. Cut into slices just before serving.</div>
<div class="method">To make the birch honey, combine the honey and water in a saucepan and bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat, whisking continuously, for 2 to 3 minutes, until smooth. Remove from the heat, add the birch, and let cool to room temperature. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, place a slice of the pudding on a plate and set a spoonful of the granita beside it. Sprinkle the meringue over the pudding, then drizzle with the honey and garnish with the dried birch.</div>

<p class="note_head"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>NOTES</strong></span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">1. Gunnar laces the meringue with his schnapps, but if you cannot locate it (it is sold everywhere in Iceland but is difficult to find outside of the country), a dark spiced rum is a good substitute.</span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">2. The meringue must first be whisked by hand to aerate it enough to give the whip enough volume to catch and begin doing its job.</span></p>
