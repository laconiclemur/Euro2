			<p class="rec-intro">L’aigo boulido means ‘boiled garlic’ and this soup is often prescribed for people who are feeling under the weather or in need of some detox. It is enhanced by a touch of sage, which is also a mild antiseptic and helps the digestion. There are many variations but everyone agrees that this is best made with new season garlic, which is sweet and innocuous. </p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 4</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">20 garlic cloves, or more to taste</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 litre water</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">pinch of coarse sea salt</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">8 sage leaves, sliced</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">thick slices of stale country-style bread</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 tbsp strong olive oil (optional)</p>
		</div>
		<div class="basic-text-frame">
			<p class="body">Peel the garlic and cut each clove into 5 or 6 slices. Put the garlic into a saucepan with the water and some salt, bring to the boil and simmer for 30 minutes. Add the sliced sage leaves and take the pan off the heat. </p>
			<p class="body">Tradition has it that you put the stale bread in the bottom of the bowl and pour the piping hot soup on top, with or without a drizzle of olive oil. When you’ve eaten all but a few spoonfuls of soup, add a dose of wine to your bowl before finishing it off – strictly medicinal of course!</p>
