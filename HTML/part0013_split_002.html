<p class="center1"><em class="calibre7">The French adore Spanish Paella. I took a picture of this fantastic giant paella and stew at the</em> Trouvill<em class="calibre7">e outdoor market (in the Normandy region, right on the pier). Can you imagine the scent of Paella and roasted chicken wafting through the outdoor market? Can you imagine eating the warm Paella at a</em> pique-nique sur la plage<em class="calibre7">?</em></p><div id="c10s01.01" class="calibre1"><p class="img"><span class="calibre37"><b class="calibre4">Paella aux Fruits de Mer -- Seafood Paella</b></span></p><p class="center"><span class="calibre37"><b class="calibre4">Ingredients for six to eight servings</b></span></p><p class="calibre6">2 tbsp canola or safflower oil</p><p class="calibre6">2 quarts fish stock (or make from scratch using 1 whole crab, salt, and pepper), or chicken broth</p><p class="calibre6">1 lb mussels and clams (must be tightly closed)</p><p class="calibre6">6 chicken thighs</p><p class="calibre6">2 chorizos (or milder sausage if you prefer)</p><p class="calibre6">¾ lb raw shrimp</p><p class="calibre6">½ lb chopped calamari</p><p class="calibre6">2 tbsp butter</p><p class="calibre6">2 small onions, chopped</p><p class="calibre6">3 cloves of garlic, chopped</p><p class="calibre6">2 sweet red peppers, diced</p><p class="calibre6">4 small zucchini, diced</p><p class="calibre6">3 tomatoes in season or</p><p class="calibre6">1-28 oz can whole tomatoes</p><p class="calibre6">1 lb short grain rice such as Arborio. Avoid Asian rice or the kind of rice that becomes creamy such as risotto.</p><p class="calibre6">1 large pinch saffron threads</p><p class="calibre6">2 cups fresh or frozen peas</p><p class="calibre6">Salt and pepper</p><p class="center1"><span class="calibre37"><b class="calibre4">Directions</b></span></p><p class="calibre6">You will need two pans: one to cook and the other to hold the ingredients that have already been cooked. Once an ingredient is cooked, keep it warm in a 200°oven: enough to keep warm but not hot enough to dry or overcook.</p><p class="calibre6">1- Cut the chorizo into ½ inch thick slices. Dice the red peppers and remove all seeds. Dice the tomatoes if they are fresh. Peel and finely chop garlic and onion. Chop the calamari into ½ inch bits.</p><p class="calibre6">2- Heat the vegetable oil in a wide skillet. Sauté the chorizo on all sides. Add the chicken and sauté on all sides. Add 2 cups of broth and cover. Cook for 20 minutes on medium heat. Add a bit of broth and/or lower the heat as needed so that it won’t burn. Set aside the chorizo and chicken and keep warm. Make sure all the juices remain in the skillet.</p><p class="calibre6">3- In the same pan, sauté the shrimp in the juices. After 2 minutes, add 1 cup of broth. Cover and cook for about 6 minutes. Reserve the shrimp and keep warm in 200°F oven. Let all the juices evaporate in the pan but don’t let it burn.</p><p class="calibre6">4- In the same pan, add a bit of oil and sauté the calamari. Reserve and keep warm. Let all the juices evaporate again.</p><p class="calibre6">5- In the same pan, add a bit of oil and sauté the diced onions until translucent. Add the red peppers and stir. Add garlic and stir. Now add the canned (no need to drain) or fresh chopped tomatoes, and stir for 5 minutes.</p><p class="calibre6">6- Add the rice to pan and stir well, coating the rice with the tomato sauce. Add the amount of broth recommended on the rice package. Add saffron threads. After the initial boil, lower the heat to medium and cover for 20 minutes or until the stock has been absorbed. Halfway though this process, decide if your rice is yellow enough and, if needed, add saffron to darken it to a nice sunflower gold.</p><p class="calibre6">7- Before the rice is cooked all the way, add chopped zucchini and peas and cook until the rice is still firm but not crunchy. If the stock is absorbed but the rice is still crunchy, add stock, one cup at a time, cover, and continue to cook until the rice is tender. Taste and add salt if needed. (If you run out of stock, which you might have already, don’t panic. Water will do at this point since the flavor has been built.)</p><p class="calibre6">8- While the rice finishes cooking, bring two cups of fish/chicken stock to a boil in a separate pan. Drop the clams and mussels into the pot. Cover and cook for ten minutes. Discard any clams or mussels that did not open. You can add the leftover liquid to the cooking rice.</p><p class="calibre6">9- Once the rice is cooked, place it in a mound in a wide, shallow dish. Retrieve all the cooked ingredients from the oven where they have been kept warm. Place the chicken, chorizo and shrimp around the rice. Top with mussels and clams.</p><p class="calibre6">10- Mix and serve at the table in front of your guests.</p><p class="calibre6">Accompany with white wine, cold beer, a simple green salad and a faux Spanish accent.</p></div></div></body></html>
