<p class="summary">My Catalan friend Pepa Aymami had a huge crateful of wild mushrooms, <span class="italic">setas,</span> spread out on towels on the garden table on her terrace in Barcelona. You could smell the forest. She cleaned off any bits of earth with a brush and cooked them in a huge skillet over high heat with a little sweet-tasting extra virgin olive oil, a sprinkling of salt, and just a touch of crushed garlic, so that it would not mask the flavors and aromas of the mushrooms.</p>
<p class="summary">Wild mushrooms grow in breathtaking varieties in the Basque Country and Catalonia, where people are crazy about them. Catalans have identified a hundred edible species, about fifteen of them of gastronomic quality. The most prized are cèpes, chanterelles, and morels. During the season in September and October, market stalls are full of mushrooms. People go mushroom hunting in the mountains. You can learn to identify the edible ones on organized tours, and you get to cook them and eat them. There are mushroom festivals, and restaurants dedicate their menus to them. They are grilled, sautéed, baked, or scrambled with eggs; used as a garnish for game and meat; and added to sauces and stews.</p>
<p class="summary">Wild mushrooms grow in other parts of Spain, especially in the wet northwest, but people there had always been afraid of picking them—until Catalans and Basques came to get them. They were afraid because three or four people are said to die of food poisoning every year. And until recently they did not value them because they were wild and free.</p>
