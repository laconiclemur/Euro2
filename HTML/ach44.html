<p class="author1"><span class="txit">focaccia tropiano</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The wonderful aroma of fresh breads and pizzas wafting from my grandmother’s kitchen was a staple of my mother’s childhood. This recipe makes two medium-size focaccias, which may be served with lunch, as an appetizer, or with dinner. For variety, fresh herbs such as rosemary, sage, marjoram, or basil may be added to the dough when the focaccia is first kneaded, or combined with the olive oil that is drizzled on top just before baking.</p>
<p class="indentb">My mother mixes this dough by hand. However it may also be prepared in a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 package dry yeast or 1 cake fresh yeast</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cups warm water</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 cups all-purpose flour</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus more for sprinkling</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 tablespoons cornmeal</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 tablespoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> In a measuring cup, combine the yeast with <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup of the warm water. Stir until the yeast dissolves.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture. Begin by mixing with a fork and then use your hands while adding enough of the remaining 1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups water to form a soft, dry dough.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and continue mixing it with your hands. Add flour as necessary to keep the dough from being too sticky. Knead until the dough is no longer sticky. Form the dough into a ball and place in a large bowl. Cover loosely with a clean dish towel or with plastic wrap that has been brushed with olive oil on the side that faces down into the bowl. Set aside in a warm place and allow to rise until it has doubled in size, about 2 hours.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_90"/><span class="red">4.</span> Preheat the oven to 400° F.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> Divide the risen dough in half. Roll one half of the dough on a lightly floured surface to a size that will roughly fit a baking sheet, about 9 x 13 inches. Sprinkle the baking sheet with 2 tablespoons of the cornmeal. Place the dough on the baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap or a clean dish towel. Allow to rise for 30 minutes. Proceed in the same fashion with the other half of the dough.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">6.</span> Use your fingertips to make random indentations in the risen dough. Drizzle approximately 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over each piece of dough, and sprinkle with additional kosher salt. Bake on the bottom rack of the oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">7.</span> Serve sliced, warm or at room temperature.</p>
<p class="serves"><span class="smallcaps">— SERVES 12 —</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">NOTE</span>:</span> Dough that has risen once may be wrapped in plastic and stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, or frozen for up to 1 month. Allow the dough to come to room temperature before rolling it out to fit on a baking sheet. Then set it aside to rise for half an hour before proceeding with the recipe.</p>
