				<p class="recipesidebarhead">Sherry Darling</p>
				<p class="recipesidebar">Fino, Manzanilla, amontillado, oloroso, cream — these are all different types of the Spanish fortified wine known as sherry. Varying in color, depth of flavor, and degree of dryness or sweetness, the different types of sherries provide a versatile drink that can be served as both an aperitif before a meal or as a dessert wine. Dry sherries are usually served chilled, while the sweeter ones are served at cellar temperature. Finos are dry and light; Manzanillas are dry, delicate, and slightly salty; amontillados are nutty, slightly sweet, and darker than finos; and olorosos are sweet and darker still. Cream sherry is another name for the sweet oloroso type.</p></div>
