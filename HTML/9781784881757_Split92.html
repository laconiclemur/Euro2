<h1 class="chapter">grana padano timbale</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>This is one of the best-selling dishes at our restaurant Caldesi in Campagna. The recipe was shown to us by Tuscan chef Riccardo Cappelli. It can be made in moulds and turned out, or cooked and served in small ramekins.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 6 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>unsalted butter, for greasing</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 eggs, beaten</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>125 ml (4 fl oz/½ cup) whole (full-fat) milk</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>125 ml (4 fl oz/½ cup) double (heavy) cream</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>good pinch of salt</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>good pinch of freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>150 g (5 oz) finely grated Grana Padano</b></p>
<p class="tx3"><b>TO SERVE</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 ripe medium tomatoes, roughly chopped, to serve</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>small handful of basil leaves, to serve</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>good-quality extra-virgin olive oil, to serve</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Preheat the oven to 160°C (320°F/Gas 3). Grease 6 × 150 ml (5 fl oz) dariole moulds or ramekins generously and put a circle of baking parchment at the bottom of each one. (You do not need to do this if you are not going to turn them out.)</p>
<p class="tx">Mix the beaten eggs with the milk, cream, salt and pepper. Add the grated cheese and stir it through. Pour the mixture into the moulds until they are three-quarters full then set them on a baking tray. Add enough water to the tray to come 2 cm (¾ in) up the sides of the moulds. Bake in the oven for 30 minutes or until golden brown on top and set. Serve with freshly chopped tomato, basil and a swirl of olive oil.</p>
