			<p class="rec-intro">In this dish, the meat is removed from the chops, minced and then reformed around the bones. Some would ask why bother mincing up a delicious piece of meat in this way? Just try it is my answer and you’ll discover how delicious it is. Serve with a good meat jus, heightened with a little lemon juice. A classic dish, it may have been invented by a cook called Pojarski for Tsar Nicholas 1.</p>

			<p class="serves">serves 4</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 double veal chops</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">100g unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">100g white breadcrumbs, soaked in 2 tbsp of cream until soft</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">plain flour </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">breadcrumbs</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 free-range eggs</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">vegetable oil (enough to shallow fry)</p>

			<p class="body">Take the meat off the chops and set the bones aside. Trim the meat and remove any sinew, then mince the meat with the butter and mix in the softened breadcrumbs. Season the mixture well, then shape it along each chop bone to reform the shape. Place the chops in the fridge to set.</p>
			<p class="body">Spread the flour and breadcrumbs on separate plates and whisk the eggs in a bowl.</p>
			<p class="body">Dust the chops with flour first, then dip them into the egg and lastly coat with breadcrumbs. Place the chops in the fridge again to chill and set before frying – don’t be tempted to skip this step, as it is important that the chops are firm before frying. </p>
			<p class="body">Heat enough vegetable oil in a frying pan for shallow frying. Add the chops and gently brown them all over. Turn them carefully so that all of the breadcrumb coating is beautifully golden – you’ll need to hold each chop with tongs to brown the edges.</p>
			<p class="body">Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 200°C/Fan 180°C/Gas 6. Place the browned chops in the oven for about 15 minutes or until the meat is cooked but still pink. Slice each chop in half and serve with some sautéed spinach. </p>
