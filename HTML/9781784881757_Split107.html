<p class="tx2"><b><i>Secondi</i>, the ‘second course’, is usually a form of protein in an Italian meal and follows a starter, or <i>primo</i>, of a soup or pasta. Inland Tuscany <i>secondi</i> is likely to be meat, with fish more popular on the coast. We love to tour Tuscan markets and collect ideas from the stalls. The butchers are the most interesting to me as it seems they just can’t leave a piece of meat alone. Neatly tied packages of stuffed tenderloins, turkey rolls filled with cheese, joints ready for the oven tied with rosemary, and rolled and filled rabbit are crammed into chilled cabinets. There are vegetarian offerings like spinach patties and stuffed vegetables available too, showing the rising trend in non-meat-eaters. We have chosen a range of <i>secondi</i> for this chapter, from the ancient <i>peposo</i> (see <a href="9781784881757_Split120.html#page_208">slow-cooked beef stew with black peppercorns</a>) to personal favourites such as the <a href="9781784881757_Split115.html#page_199">Rabbit in White Wine</a>, and our own invention of the <a href="9781784881757_Split118.html#page_205">porcini loaf</a>, inspired by those market stalls.</b></p>
