<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Few appetizers are as simple or more pleasantly surprising in taste than dates wrapped in bacon. For an added layer of texture and flavor, slip a toasted almond inside each date before wrapping with bacon. The dates can be wrapped in advance, covered with plastic wrap, and refrigerated until ready to fry and serve. Prepare them either on the stovetop or in the oven. Both versions follow.</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">     Large—but not jumbo—size dates are best, as they can be popped in the mouth and eaten in a single bite. While North Africa produces most dates found in Spanish markets, Spain itself does grow them in Elche, south of Alicante. This ancient walled city was under Moorish rule for a few centuries, falling to the Christians in 1265 during the <em>reconquista</em>. During these centuries, palm trees were introduced. Today the <em>palmeral</em> (palm grove) has a total of 200,000 trees. These are so unique and important to the region, UNESCO named the grove a World Heritage Site.</span></strong></p>

</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Cut each of the bacon strips into lengths about 3 inches/7.5 cm long. They need to be only long enough to wrap around a date a single time and just overlap. Wrap each date with a piece of bacon and secure with a toothpick.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> <em>To prepare on the stovetop:</em> In a small skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat and fry the wrapped dates until the bacon is golden and just crunchy and the dates warmed through and tender, about 4 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><em>To prepare in the oven:</em> Preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C/gas mark 4. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Arrange the wrapped dates on the sheet and bake, turning if needed, until the bacon is golden and just crunchy, and the dates are warmed through and tender, about 6 minutes. Transfer to a plate.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Serve immediately while still hot.</p>
