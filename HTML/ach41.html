<p class="author1"><span class="txit">pastina con uova</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">In Italy, <span class="txit">pastina</span> is any of the little pastas given to babies and small children, such as orzo or small star shapes. My father, Stan, remembers his mother making this dish for him for a quick warm lunch or if he wasn’t feeling too well. My mother, Joan, who walked home for lunch from school each day, remembers her grandmother preparing plain warm pastina drizzled with olive oil as a lunchtime meal. So you can try this dish the Tucci way, with eggs, or the Tropiano way, without eggs.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup pastina pasta</span></p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Reserve 1 cup of the cooking water before draining the pastina. Return the cup of hot water and the drained pastina to the saucepan over medium-high heat. Break the eggs, if using, directly into the saucepan. Whisk and simmer to cook the eggs, about 1 minute. Divide between two plates, and top with equal portions of the butter. Serve immediately.</p>
