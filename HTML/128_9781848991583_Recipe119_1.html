<p class="normal"><b>Pan-fried plums are always flavorsome, with their touch of acidity and appealing, delicate texture, so I thought a cookie would be good with these—and a biscotti seemed just the right choice. It’s unusual, perhaps not often baked at home, and the almonds give it a good nutty crunch. For a change, try serving the fruit with silky Greek-style yogurt with a sprinkling of cinnamon.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE ALMOND BISCOTTI</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">7 tablespoons unsalted butter, soft</p>
<p class="acktxt">⅓ cup sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 eggs</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ vanilla bean, halved lengthwise and seeds scraped out</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="acktxt">grated zest of ½ lemon</p>
<p class="acktxt">a pinch ground star anise</p>
<p class="acktxt">¼ cup very fnely ground blanched almonds</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ teaspoon baking powder</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 tablespoons whole blanched almonds, toasted</p>
<p class="acktxta">a pinch of salt</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE PLUMS</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">10 plums at room temperature, halved and pitted, then each cut into 8 segments</p>
<p class="acktxta">1 tablespoon amaretto</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE AMARETTO CREAM</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">¼ cup confectioner’s sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 egg</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup mascarpone, at room temperature</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup double cream</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons amaretto</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Heat the oven to 350°F and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. To make the biscotti, beat together the butter and sugar, using an electric mixer, until very pale and fluffy. Add 2 of the eggs, one at a time, beating in between each addition, then add all the vanilla seeds and all the remaining biscotti ingredients, except the remaining egg and the salt. Continue to mix on slow speed until the dough just comes together. Scoop the dough onto a lightly floured countertop and form into a log about 8 inches long and 3 inches wide. Using the palms of your hands, roll the log until it is 1 inch thick, then put it on the prepared baking sheet; it should just fit.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Whisk the remaining egg with the salt and 1 tablespoon water. Brush this mixture over the top of the loaf, then bake 8 minutes. Turn the baking sheet around, front to back, turn the oven down to 300°F and bake 20 to 25 minutes longer until pale golden.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Meanwhile, to cook the plums, put a skillet over low heat. Add the sugar and cook slowly a few minutes until it turns to a light golden caramel. Add the plums, a few pieces at a time, mix them into the caramel and cook 5 minutes, or until they are soft. Drizzle the amaretto over and stir gently. Leave the plums to cool to room temperature.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> To make the amaretto cream, whisk the confectioner’s sugar and egg in a large bowl until very light and pale. Mix the mascarpone and cream in a separate bowl, then whisk in the amaretto. Whisk the mixtures together until smooth, silky and very soft but just holding soft peaks.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> Remove the biscotti from the oven, transfer to a cutting board and cut off both ends of the loaf, then cut the rest into ½-inch slices. Put them flat on the cookie sheet and bake 5 to 8 minutes longer until they are just dry and a light golden color. Crumble the cut-off ends of the biscotti into ¼-inch pieces in a small bowl.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>6</b> Sprinkle half the plums with the crumble and half the amaretto cream, then spoon some more plums on top and finish with the rest of the amaretto cream. Balance a biscotti on top and serve the rest separately.</p>
