<p class="center"><em class="calibre7">Here is a leaner variation of this recipe: lightly brush olive oil on the eggplant slices (skip the flour) and place the slices in an oven, a barbecue or even a panini maker. You will not obtain the marvelous taste and texture of the fried eggplant, but this is a good alternative for obvious (but depressing) reasons.</em></p><div id="c02s01.01" class="calibre1"><p class="img"><span class="calibre14"><b class="calibre4">Aubergines au Parmesan -- Eggplant Parmesan</b></span></p><p class="center1"><span class="calibre14"><b class="calibre4">Ingredients for four to six servings</b></span></p><p class="calibre6">2- 28 oz can crushed tomatoes</p><p class="calibre6">2 large unpeeled eggplants sliced ½ inch thick.

When the oil is hot but not smoking add the chopped parsley and crushed garlic and stir. Being careful it doesn’t burn, quickly add both cans of tomatoes and stir. Reduce the heat and simmer uncovered so that the sauce reduces. You want a sauce that is moist but not runny, thick but not pasty. Let it bubble up gently on the stove while you prepare the rest of the recipe.</p><p class="calibre6">2- In a plate sprinkle flour on both sides of the eggplant. Some people sprinkle the eggplant slices with salt and let it sweat. I’ve never had the patience. Reserve the eggplant slices and toss the remaining flour. Heat the canola oil. When it is very hot but not smoking, add a layer of eggplant. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, flip and cook the other side. The goal is not to cook the eggplant slice but to grill its sides. Place the semi-cooked eggplant slices on 2 sheets of paper towel and repeat with the rest of the eggplant slices. Now here comes the moment of truth: it will take much more oil than I was comfortable revealing, but by now you’re in too deep and can’t turn back.</p><p class="calibre6">3- Take a look at the sauce. Does it look sexy yet? Any last minute adjustment? If it reduced too much, cover, lower the heat, add water, or all of the above. If it’s too liquid, drain some of the liquid out, uncover, turn up the heat, or all of the above (don’t turn on the heat and walk away as the sauce will burn and your life will be ruined.) Five minutes before assembling add the basil and stir. I personally like basil that was not overcooked. Add pepper and salt to taste.</p><p class="calibre6">4- Now comes the fun part. Decide if you’re going for the family style vibe or the fancyshmancy look and choose either a pretty oven-proof dish (about 9 x 9), or ramekins for individual portions. For extra garlic taste and an evening of fragrant garlic kisses, rub a peeled garlic clove on the bottom and sides of the dish.</p><p class="calibre6">5- Cover the bottom of the dish with sauce. Place one layer of eggplant slices. Sprinkle the eggplant with a generous amount of Parmesan cheese while loudly singing O Sole Mio. Add layers of eggplant and grated Parmesan until you’ve used it all. Top with layer of fresh mozzarella. Cover with the remainder of the sauce.</p><p class="calibre6">6- Wait for your guests to arrive before this last step. When they do, place the dish(es) in the oven at 350°F for 30 to 40 minutes or until the sauce is bubbly and the cheese melts. Before serving add a few leaves or parsley or basil as a garnish.</p><p class="calibre6">7- Serve with pasta, garlic bread, Caesar salad, or anything vaguely Italian you can think of.</p></div></div></body></html>
