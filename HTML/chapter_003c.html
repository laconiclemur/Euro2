<h2 class="h2b">BOURRIDE DE LOTTE</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Monkfish Bourride</em></h3>
<p class="normall"><em>Perhaps less known than bouillabaisse but nonetheless just as difficult to pronounce and a real Provençal classic. Thickened with a garlicky aïoli which is itself enriched with extra egg yolks, the finished soup has a velvet-smooth texture. The favoured fish for</em> bourride <em>are monkfish, John Dory and whiting. I think it is best, though, just using good meaty monkfish, which holds wonderfully and doesn’t dry out while being poached</em>.</p>
<p class="normalla0"><em>Have your fishmonger fillet and trim the monkfish for you, keeping all the bones and trimmings for the stock</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
1kg (2lb 4oz) monkfish tail<br/>
1 leek, finely sliced<br/>
1 onion, peeled and finely sliced<br/>
1 small fennel bulb, finely sliced<br/>
4 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced<br/>
1 bouquet garni (thyme, bay, dried orange zest)<br/>
60ml (2¼fl oz) olive oil<br/>
250ml (9fl oz) dry white wine<br/>
8 large slices baguette, cut at an angle<br/>
2 egg yolks<br/>
1 recipe <em>Aïoli</em> (<em><a href="chapter_003k.html#page92">see here</a></em>)</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 160°C/325°F/Gas 3.</p>
<p class="normala">Sweat the monkfish bones, leek, onion, fennel and bouquet garni in the olive oil for 5 minutes until soft. Pour over the white wine and boil off the alcohol. Add just enough water to cover, boil, skim, and simmer rapidly for 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="normala">In the meantime cut the monkfish fillets into slices at an angle. Try and get six thick even-sized slices per fillet. Set these aside.</p>
<p class="normala">Strain the stock and reduce it by about a third. (This part you can easily do well in advance.) Add the monkfish and gently poach it for about 10 minutes. While it is cooking toast the slices of bread in the oven until golden and crisp, and mix the egg yolks with half the aïoli in a large bowl. Put the rest of the aïoli in a serving dish.</p>
<p class="normala">When the monkfish is cooked lift it out on to the slices of bread and keep it warm in the oven. Boil the stock and add it little by little into the aïoli with the added egg yolks, whisking it in well and making sure it doesn’t curdle. When you have added half of the stock, pour it back into the pot with the other half, stir well to combine and heat gently, making sure it doesn’t boil.</p>
<p class="normala">Put the monkfish and toasted bread into four warmed soup plates, ladle over some of the soup, and serve the rest either in the pot or in a large tureen for people to help themselves. Offer the remaining aïoli on the side.</p>
