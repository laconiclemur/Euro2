<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Like many rural bean dishes, this one is a</span> potaje, <span class="italic">or soup, that is transformed on festive occasions into a grand meal with spareribs and all kinds of cured pork meats, blood sausage, and chorizo. But even then the consistency has to be soupy. By tradition, the dish is accompanied by boiled cabbage and small, elongated mild green peppers called</span> guindillas, <span class="italic">pickled in vinegar.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">The red beans of Tolosa that grew in symbiosis with corn in the steep vegetable gardens of small farmers in the Basque hills have become legendary. They are celebrated during a</span> Semana de la Alubia <span class="italic">(Bean Week) in Tolosa with cooking competitions and communal meals. The beans are dark purple, almost black, and deliciously creamy with a thin skin. The important thing is to cook them so that they are very tender without their skins splitting. You can cook all the different ingredients—the beans, meat, and cabbage—in advance and reheat before serving.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 pound red beans, soaked (see Soaking Beans, page 487)</p>
<p class="qun">1 small onion, peeled</p>
<p class="qun">2 garlic cloves, peeled</p>
<p class="qun">6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">8 country-style pork spareribs</p>
<p class="qun">½ pound slab bacon, in one piece</p>
<p class="qun">About 1 pound semi-cured chorizos</p>
<p class="qun">About 1 pound <span class="italic">morcillas</span> (Spanish blood sausages)</p>
<p class="qun">1 small green cabbage, cut into 6 wedges</p>
<p class="qun1"><span class="italic">Guindillas</span> (mild green chiles preserved in vinegar) for serving</p>
<p class="recsum">Drain the beans and put them in a large saucepan with the onion, garlic, and 3 tablespoons of the olive oil. Cover with fresh cold water and bring to a boil, removing any foam, then simmer over very low heat for 1½ hours, or until the beans are very tender. Add cold water to cover as necessary, and watch that their skins do not split. When they begin to soften, add salt.</p>
<p class="summary">Meanwhile, cook the spareribs and bacon in a large pot of water over low heat for 1 hour. Add the chorizos to the spareribs and simmer for 20 minutes. Add the blood sausages and cook for no more than 10 minutes (or they may burst). Drain and add to the beans when they are cooked.</p>
<p class="summary">Cook the cabbage in a large pot of boiling salted water—it will be tender in minutes. Remove the cabbage when it’s done, then plunge into the same water, brought to a boil, just before serving.</p>

<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">Caparrones,</span> the small mottled beans that grow in La Rioja, can be used instead of red beans for a Riojan version of the dish.</p>
