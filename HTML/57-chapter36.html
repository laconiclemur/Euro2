<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Heavily seasoned and marinated skewers of meat are a staple bar tapa. Originally lamb or beef was used, but these days pork is by far the most popular meat. And while this tapa is found across the breadth of the country, the unusually heavy use of spices reveals its southern origins.</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">     Use the butt end of a pork loin or else the shoulder—both are tender, juicy cuts—and trim into same-size pieces to ensure even cooking. Serve with cold glasses of beer, preferably from one of the finer Spanish brewers like Alhambra, Moritz, or Estrella Galicia.</span></strong></p>

<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> In a large bowl, combine the spices, herbs, and garlic; season with salt and pepper; and blend in the olive oil and a few drops of vinegar. Mix into a moist paste. Add the pork and turn to coat well. Cover with plastic wrap, refrigerate, and marinate for at least 1 hour, though ideally a few hours longer. Toss the pork from time to time while it marinates.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> Thread 4 to 6 pieces of pork on each skewer so that the pieces just touch.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Preheat a grill pan, griddle pan, or large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat and very lightly oil it. Lay on the skewers and grill, turning from time to time with the help of a spatula in order to cook them evenly on each side, until the meat is cooked through and firm to the touch, 8 to 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> If desired, impale a piece of bread on the tip and serve hot on the skewer.</p>
