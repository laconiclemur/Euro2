<p class="running_first"><a id="page_1"/><a id="page_2"/><span class="font1">FROM THE CRAGGY CATALAN COASTLINE TO THE UNDULATING, RED-SOILED HILLS OF ANDALUCÍA,</span> the diversity of the Spanish countryside is without rival. The cuisine directly reflects this landscape, with each region celebrating its own ingredients and culinary traditions. In <em>Spain</em>, long-time Barcelona resident Jeff Koehler gathers the country’s many time-honored dishes and age-old culinary customs, and distills the Spanish table down to its essence—food that is prepared simply but full of homemade flavors, and always meant to be shared.</p>
<p class="running_first">Each chapter is an ode to Spain’s delightful kitchen, from gazpachos, salt cod, and poultry to savory and sweet conserves. The story of the country is told through 200 recipes from classics like Shellfish Paella, Artichoke Egg Tortilla, and creamy Citrus-and-Cinnamon-Scented Flan to delicacies such as Chilled Melon Soup with Crispy Jamón and Monkfish Steaks with Saffron. Dishes from Spain’s leisurely multi-course meals and unpretentious tapas alike celebrate seasonal ingredients: wild mushrooms, asparagus, and local game. Sidebars trace Spain’s rich culinary traditions, taking us from ancient Moorish cities to the arid fields of the Castilian countryside, and allow us to meet some of the people who still, with devotion, make the cuisine so exceptional. Accompanying these are hundreds of evocative photos of the markets, orchards, verdant hills, and fishing ports from which these gastronomic riches originate.</p>
<p class="running_first">Add to this a thorough glossary that includes techniques such as preparing snails, using saffron, and making perfect fish stock, as well as a helpful source list. Novices and veterans of the Spanish kitchen alike will gain a deeper understanding not only of Spain’s cuisine but of its culture.</p>
