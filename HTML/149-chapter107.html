<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">The central market in Valencia is one of the most spectacular in the country, with soaring cupolas, ceilings that reach 100 feet/30 m, and ample windows that infuse it with Mediterranean light. And that is only the architecture! Nearly one thousand food stalls offer the spectacular makings of Valencia’s rather baroque cuisine. The city was under Muslim rule for five centuries (until 1238), and that legacy can clearly be tasted. One prominent influence is the frequent combination of sweet and savory. This chicken dish is one such example, and is adapted from a small book that the stall holders put together a few years ago.</span></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>3 POUNDS/1.4 KG FREE-RANGE CHICKEN DRUMSTICKS AND THIGHS</li>
<li>SALT</li>
<li>GROUND WHITE PEPPER</li>
<li>18 WHOLE SHALLOTS</li>
<li>¼ CUP/60 ML EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL</li>
<li>1 TEASPOON ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR, PLUS MORE FOR DREDGING</li>
<li>GENEROUS 1 CUP FRESH VALENCIA ORANGE JUICE</li>
<li>1 CINNAMON STICK, BROKEN IN HALF</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Remove the skin and trim the excess fat from the chicken. Rinse and pat dry. Season with salt and white pepper.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> Peel the shallots. Finely chop two of them and set aside.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Preheat the oven to 375°F/190°C/gas mark 5.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> In a cazuela, heavy casserole, large sauté pan, or deep skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Lightly dredge the chicken in flour and brown in single-layer batches that don’t crowd the pan, about 5 minutes per batch. Transfer to a platter.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Add the whole shallots to the cazuela and cook until golden, 2 to 3 minutes, and then transfer with a slotted spoon to the platter with the chicken. Add the chopped shallots and cook until tender and golden, about 2 minutes. Stir in the 1 teaspoon flour and then add the orange juice and cinnamon stick. Bring to a boil and boil for 2 minutes, stirring continually. Remove the pan from the heat.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">6.</span> In a large baking dish or roasting pan, arrange the chicken without overlapping the pieces, scatter around the whole shallots, and pour over the sauce. Loosely cover with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes, or until the chicken is done and just starting to separate from the bone.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">7.</span> Spoon the sauce into a saucepan and reduce by about one-fourth over high heat into a thickish glaze, about 3 minutes. To serve, place a drumstick and a thigh with some whole shallots on each plate and ladle over some sauce.</p>
