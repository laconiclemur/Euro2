<p class="author1"><span class="txit">ragù tucci</span></p>
<p class="noindent">This is the traditional recipe for the Tuccis’ <span class="txit">ragù</span> sauce, though my grandmother made a lighter version of this same sauce. It calls for spareribs and stewing beef, but different cuts of meat may be added depending on what is on hand—pork chops, sausage, pig’s feet. It is delicious with <a class="nounder" href="ach130.html#page_252">Meatballs</a> (<span class="txit">polpette</span>), which may be added to the sauce during the last half hour of cooking.</p>
<p class="indentb">This sauce, which is used in Timpano alla <span class="txit">Big Night</span> (see note below), may be prepared two days ahead of serving. Refrigerate it overnight and reheat before tossing with the pasta. It may also be frozen with the meat and meatballs.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 pound stewing beef, trimmed of fat, rinsed, patted dry, and cut into pieces</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 pound country-style spareribs, trimmed of fat, cut in half, rinsed, and patted dry</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup coarsely chopped onions</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup dry red wine</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">One 6-ounce can tomato paste</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups warm water</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">8 cups canned whole plum tomatoes (about two 35-ounce cans), passed through a food mill, or pureed in a blender or food processor</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 fresh basil leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano leaves or 1 teaspoon dried</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Warm the olive oil in a stew pot set over medium-high heat. Sear the stewing beef until brown on all sides, about 10 minutes. Remove from the pot and set aside in a bowl.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Add the spareribs to the pot and sear until they are brown on all sides, about 10 minutes. Remove the ribs and set aside in the bowl with the stewing beef. (If your pot is big enough to hold all of the meat in a single layer, it may be cooked at the same time.)</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_123"/><span class="red">3.</span> Stir the onions and garlic into the pot. Reduce the heat to low and cook until the onions begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in the wine, scraping the bottom of the pot clean. Add the tomato paste. Pour <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup of the water into the can to loosen any residual paste and then pour the water into the pot. Cook to warm the paste through, about 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes along with the remaining 1 cup water. Stir in the basil and oregano. Cover with the lid slightly askew and simmer to sweeten the tomatoes, about 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Return the meat to the pot, along with any extra juices that have accumulated in the bowl. Cover with the lid slightly askew and simmer, stirring frequently, until the meat is very tender and the tomatoes are cooked, about 2 hours. Warm water may be added to the sauce, in <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>-cup portions, if the sauce becomes too thick. (If you have made meatballs, sauté separately to warm through and then they may be added during the last half hour of cooking. The meatballs will soften and absorb some of the sauce.)</p>

The sauce for timpano should be thin, so measure out 7<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups of prepared sauce and stir in <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup water before proceeding with the timpano recipe.</p>
