<h2 class="rec_heading" id="sab0001536"><a id="pg270" class="pcalibre calibre8"></a>CHERRY TART</h2>
<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0001537">When I first came to London, you couldn’t find good cherries; my butcher used to bring me a box of large, burgundy cherries from Spain every year and when he did, I would make this tart.</p>
<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0001538">This recipe makes enough for two pastry tarts but you can always freeze one half – or make the pear tart <a href="part0202.html#pg272" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>.</p>
<aside class="sidebar_wrapper">
<h5 class="serves">MAKES 1 TART (26CM)</h5>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001539">1kg of the best possible dark red cherries, halved and pitted</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001540">150ml <em class="calibre9">orujo</em> (Galician spirit, like grappa)</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001541">icing sugar, to finish</p>
<p class="d_heads" id="sab0001542">For the sweet pastry</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001543">420g cold but malleable butter, cut into cubes, plus extra to grease the tin</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001544">300g icing sugar</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001545">750g flour, plus extra to dust</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001546">30g ground almonds (or blended whole almonds)</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001547">2 eggs</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001548">2 egg yolks</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001549">zest of 3 lemons</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001550">3 vanilla pods</p>
<p class="d_heads" id="sab0001551">For the <em class="calibre12">crema pastelera</em></p>

<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0001558">60g cornflour</p>
</aside>
<div class="maincontent_wrapper">
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0001561">Leave the cherries to soak in the <em class="calibre9">orujo</em> for 6–8 hours or overnight, then drain (reserving the <em class="calibre9">orujo</em>).</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0001562">To make the sweet pastry, mix the ingredients in a food processor or by hand until they come together. Divide into two flat balls, wrap in cling film and refrigerate.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0001563">To make the <em class="calibre9">crema pastelera</em>, put the milk into a pan on a low heat and infuse with the cinnamon, vanilla and lemon zest until steaming – around 15–18 minutes. Turn off the heat and leave to cool, then pass through a sieve to make a smooth mixture. Whisk the egg yolks with the sugar until pale and creamy and the sugar has dissolved. Add the cornflour and mix again, making sure there are no lumps. Add the infused milk bit by bit, then return to the heat. Cook on a very low heat until it thickens to a béchamel consistency and holds together – around 15–20 minutes, depending on the size of your pan.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0001564">Preheat your oven to 180°C, and grease a tart tin (26cm, with a removable bottom) with a little butter.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0001565"><a id="pg271" class="pcalibre calibre3"></a>Flour a sheet of baking paper and place it on a work surface somewhere cool. Remove one ball of pastry from the fridge, place it on the baking paper, and roll it out as quickly as possible to a circle at least 4cm bigger than your tin and around 3mm thick. If your pastry gets too warm and starts to melt you can put it back into the fridge to cool down.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0001566">Put your hand underneath the baking paper and gently turn the pastry out into the tin, then mould it into shape, making sure the sides are 90°. Trim the sides but leave ½cm extra, as it will shrink when it bakes: you can shape it later. Prick the base all over with a fork to help it cook through and not puff up. Put it back into the fridge for 5–10 minutes, or until it’s cold (otherwise the butter may melt too quickly when it goes into the oven).</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0001567">Bake for 15–20 minutes, keeping an eye on it and turning it so it cooks evenly. When nice and golden, leave to cool down then fill it halfway up with the cooled <em class="calibre9">crema</em>. Put it back into the fridge for 20–30 minutes to set, then remove and place the cherries cut side down over the <em class="calibre9">crema</em> until it’s completely covered.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0001568">Put the <em class="calibre9">orujo</em> into a pan and reduce until syrupy, then brush over the cherries and dust with icing sugar before serving.</p>
