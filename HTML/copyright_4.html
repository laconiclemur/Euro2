<p class="bm2">I would like to thank Heather, Grace, Wanda, Nicky, Jo and everyone else who helped me bring my stories and recipes to life.</p>
<p class="bm2t">Just in case you were wondering, Fiori di Zucca means courgette or pumpkin flowers, but the word zucca is also used affectionately to mean one’s own head. In this case perhaps, the alternative ‘Flowers from my Head’ translation has an appropriately personal feel.</p>
