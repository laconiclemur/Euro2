 AUBERGINE &amp; FETA TART</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_blue" id="nad0002972">
<em>This simple tart is easy to make and easy to freeze. With the pastry-making stage taken out, it’s that much quicker to put together, but of course if you are having a lazy weekend you might want to make the pastry from scratch, in your pyjamas, like I do. (And then I use the extra time while my pastry is chilling to play hide-and-seek or do a jigsaw with the kids!) However, when saving time is the priority, ready-rolled is ideal, and I’ve opted for easy toppings too. The soft aubergine works really well with the salty feta. I like to cut it up like a pizza and serve it with salad.</em>

<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Trim the aubergines and slice them lengthways. Brush the slices all over with the olive oil and lightly season. You may need more or less oil depending on the size of your aubergines, as the sizes can vary every time.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002985">
<span class="blue">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Place a griddle pan (or a frying pan, if that’s all you have) on a medium to high heat. Add a few slices of aubergine and griddle on each side until they become tender. Place on a plate, then do the same with the rest of the aubergine slices.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002986">
<span class="blue">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Preheat the oven to 220°C/200°C fan/gas 7.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002987">
<span class="blue">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 In a small bowl, mix together the tomato paste, garlic and dried basil.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002988">
<span class="blue">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Take the pastry out of the fridge and unroll it. It should already be on a piece of baking paper, so leave it there. Place on a large baking tray.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002989">
<span class="blue">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Using a small knife, score a 1cm border all the way around the edge of the pastry. Now prick the base of the pastry, avoiding the border – this will stop the inner part of the pastry puffing up. Brush the 1cm border with beaten egg – this will give it a gorgeous sheen when it bakes.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002990">
<span class="blue">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Spread the pricked base with all the tomato paste mixture. Lay the aubergine slices all over the tomato paste, then crumble the feta on top.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002991">
<span class="blue">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 Bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 25–30 minutes.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002992">
<span class="blue">
<strong>9.</strong>
</span>
 Once baked, take the tart out of the oven and leave on the tray for 10 minutes. Rip up the basil, sprinkle all over the top, and finally give the tart a good drizzle of olive oil.</p>
