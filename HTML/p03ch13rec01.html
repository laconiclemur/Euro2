<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">Originally from France, flan spread from the north of Spain and became ubiquitous all over the country.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE CARAMEL</span></p>
<p class="qun">½ cup sugar</p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup water</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE CUSTARD</span></p>
<p class="qun">2½ cups whole milk</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup sugar</p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
<p class="qun1">4 large eggs</p>
<p class="recsum">For the caramel, put the sugar and water in a stainless-steel saucepan and heat over medium heat. When the syrup starts to bubble and color, swirl the pan to spread the caramel evenly, and then cook until it turns a deep amber, swirling the pan occasionally (watch it, as it can turn too dark very quickly, which would result in a bitter taste). Immediately pour the caramel into a mold that holds at least 4½ cups (it can be metal, porcelain, or Pyrex), turning and tilting the mold to coat the bottom and sides. You have to do this very fast, because the caramel hardens quickly.</p>
<p class="recsum1">For the custard, put the milk, sugar, and vanilla in a saucepan and slowly bring to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat and let cool for 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Lightly beat the eggs with a fork or whisk in a large bowl. Gradually beat in the milk, starting with a ladleful, until well blended. Pour into the caramel-lined mold.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Place the mold in a large baking pan and pour in enough boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the mold (this water bath is called a bain-marie). Bake in a preheated 325°F oven for 1 hour, or until the custard has set. Take the mold out of the pan of water and let it cool, then chill in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap, for at least 3 hours, or overnight.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Just before you are ready to serve, turn out the flan: Run a pointed knife all around the edges of the mold, place a serving dish on top of the mold (there will be a lot of caramel sauce, so the dish should be deep enough to collect it), and quickly turn upside down. Lift off the mold.</p>
