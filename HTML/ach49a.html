<h3 class="h3b">pizza</h3>
<p class="author1"><span class="txit">pizza</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In her neighborhood, my grandmother Tropiano’s pizza was considered the best—quite an accomplishment in a largely Italian community. She began making dough on an almost daily basis at the age of nine or ten and was still doing it at eighty-five. My mother follows my grandmother’s example, kneading the dough by hand, but it may also be prepared in a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook.</p>
<p class="indentb">This is my family’s basic recipe for pizza. Of course, an infinite number of toppings may be used. Even the marinara sauce is optional. Roll your pizza as thick or thin as you like. My grandmother rolled hers thin enough to be cut with scissors.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 package dry yeast or 1 cake fresh yeast</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cups warm water</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 cups all-purpose flour</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 tablespoons cornmeal</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 tablespoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cups <a class="nounder" href="ach59.html#page_120">Sailor’s-Style Sauce</a></span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 cloves garlic (optional)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> teaspoon dried oregano</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 pound mozzarella cheese, grated</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup finely grated pecorino Romano cheese</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> In a measuring cup, combine the yeast with <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup of the warm water. Stir until the yeast dissolves.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture. Begin by mixing with a fork and then by hand while adding enough of the remaining 1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups water to form a soft, dry dough.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and continue mixing it with your hands. Knead to form a smooth dough, adding more flour as necessary to keep the dough from being too sticky. Form into a ball and place in a clean bowl. Cover the bowl loosely with a clean dish towel. Set it aside in a warm place and allow to rise until it has doubled in size, about 2 hours.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_102"/><span class="red">4.</span> Preheat the oven to 500° F.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> Divide the risen dough in half. Roll one half of the dough on a lightly floured surface into a rectangle that will fit on a 9 x 13-inch or 12-inch round baking street. Sprinkle the baking sheet with 2 tablespoons of cornmeal. Transfer the rolled dough to the baking sheet. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Spread 1 cup of the marinara sauce evenly over the dough to within 1 inch of the edge. Squeeze 2 of the garlic cloves, if using, through a press and sprinkle over the marinara. Sprinkle <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> teaspoon of the oregano over the marinara. Sprinkle half the mozzarella and half the Romano cheese over the marinara. Bake until the edges and bottom of the dough are lightly browned, about 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">6.</span> While the first pizza is baking, roll out the other half of the dough and top it with the remaining ingredients. Bake the second pizza. Allow each pizza to cool for 5 minutes before slicing so all the cheese doesn’t slide to the middle.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATIONS</span>:</span> A pound of Fontina, grated, may be substituted for the mozzarella. If you have scraps of leftover dough, shape them by hand into thin 4-inch rounds. Warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a small frying pan set over medium-low heat. When the oil is hot but not smoking, add the dough and fry until golden brown and puffy on one side. Turn and continue browning. Sprinkle with granulated sugar and serve as a snack. Stan’s family ate fried dough with eggs, as though it was toast.</p>
