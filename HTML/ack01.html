<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bi">Much of what is in this book fills me with nostalgia about people.</span></p>
<p class="para">I asked everybody I met in Spain during the five years I took to research this book to tell me about their favorite dishes. Some gave recipes; some spent hours, even days, talking to me about food and life, about the history of their country, and about the produce. Friends cooked for me and took me to restaurants and on <span class="italic">tapas</span> crawls; many were always available to answer questions by telephone or e-mail; colleagues gave me their books and sent me recipes; and mentors made contacts for me in different regions.</p>
<p class="para">So many people helped me that I cannot thank them all, but I do remember them all—every recipe reminds me of somebody. I am immensely grateful to the following: Alicia Ríos, Pepa Aymami, Rosa Tovar, Gaspar Rey, Angelita García de Paredes Barreda, Pepe Iglesias, José María Conde de Ybarra, Lourdes March, Cuqui Gonzáles, Lolí Flores, José Luis Alexanco, Andres Bertomeu, Manolo Ruiz López, Michael Jacobs, Ana Lorente, Luis Bertran Bittini Martinez, Jaime Rodríguez, Sister Inmaculada Romero, and Carolina Zendrera. I have written about them in the book. I am much indebted to Simon Cohen and Vicky Hayward, to food historians Xavier Medina and Antoni Riera Melis, to Josep Lladonosa and the architect Miquel Espinet who is president of the Catalan Academy of Gastronomy and Jose Alba Mendoza of the Instituto de la Grasa de Sevilla (Institute of Fats); and I owe special thanks to Rosa María Esteva Grewe, Martine Beaulieu Gracia, Marion Maitlis, and María Rosa Menocal; to Hilary Pomeroy and Edith Grossman, Elena Santonja, Encarna Vicente, and Sonia Ortega.</p>
<p class="para">I thank my publisher and editor, Daniel Halpern, a poet and a true gourmet, who initiated the book and gave his enthusiastic support and valuable advice throughout. I am grateful to Judith Sutton for her intelligent and painstaking editing; to Jason Lowe for the splendid photographs; and to my agent, Lizzy Kremmer, for her unceasing encouragement.</p>
