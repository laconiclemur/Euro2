  <p class="nonindent">Germany is unquestionably the sausage capital of the world. In some parts of the country a puppet theater is known as Wursteltheater, the counterpart of our Punch is Hans Wurst, and any fun fair is dubbed a Wurstelprater. The philosophy of “an eye for an eye” is expressed here as Wurst wider Wurst, a sausage for a sausage, and the idea that everyone gets what he deserves (you made your bed, now he in it) becomes in Germany <em>die Wurst nach dem Manne braten</em>—every man fries his own sausage. Although Munich leads all other German cities in sausage inventiveness, every section of the country has its local versions, and in the vineyard towns of the Palatinate, the Rhinelanders are especially proud of their three gastronomic W’s—<em>Week, Wurst und Wein</em>—roll, sausage and wine.</p>

  <p class="indent">An assortment of sliced sausages, served with rolls and butter, pretzels, radishes and pickled gherkins, is equally popular in Germany as a mid-morning breakfast, a light lunch, an afternoon snack, before or after soup at dinner and as a late supper.</p>

  <p class="indent">The frankfurter is only the beginning. This ancestor of our hot dog, created in the Main River city that also gave the world Goethe and the Rothschilds, is merely one of three hundred varieties that the German sausage maker (Wursthändler) has in his repertoire. Any sausage shop (Wurstladen) that takes itself seriously includes about one hundred types on its price lists and has between fifty and sixty different kinds of sausages on hand at all times.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page248"></a>These clean and sparkling shops with their garlands of white, gray, tan, red, brown and black wursts are as tempting to the eye as their wares are to the palate. Sausages vary as to their meat fillings and seasonings, their size, shape and casings, and the method of preservation used. Some are absolutely raw and fresh, others may be smoked or pickled in brine in varying degrees, still others are cooked, and many go through a combination of these processes.</p>

  <p class="indent">A visit to a German sausage shop can be a dazzling and rewarding experience. If there is one in your town or city, don’t fail to shop there and gather a sampling of its irresistible wares. The following is a very brief guide to some of the most common and delectable varieties you can choose from.</p>

  <p class="indent">Weisswurst—white sausage—is the most delicately flavored of all sausages. It is made of veal, sometimes with a little pork added, and seasoned with salt, pepper and flecks of fresh parsley. It is slightly cured in a mild brine, and is always steamed and eaten hot. The casing is removed as it is eaten. This is the great specialty of Munich, where it is served from midnight until 11 <span class="small">A.M</span>.—Brotzeit, or bread time. Purists wouldn’t touch it after that hour. It comes to the table in a casserole of hot water, along with rye rolls and, if you like, a white radish and a couple of crisp pretzels. Sweet mustard is the standard condiment. Weisswurst is so delicately flavored and its meat so finely ground, it can easily be made into veal dumplings or quenelles. Simply steam the wurst, skin it, cut into or 1”-thick slices and use as a garnish for soups or stews.</p>

  <p class="indent">Bockwurst is a small finger-size weisswurst made only in spring during bock beer time and is served with that seasonal brew. In Berlin, however, the term Bockwurst denotes a smoked red sausage, similar to our hot dog. It is made of beef, or beef and pork, and is sold the year round at late-night street-corner stands as Curry Wurst.</p>

  <p class="indent">Bratwurst, or “fry wurst,” is made mostly of pork and sometimes has a little veal added to it. The filling is coarsely ground and flavored with nutmeg, caraway, marjoram, pepper, salt and sometimes mace. The combination and degree of seasonings vary according to the taste of the sausage maker. Bratwurst is the specialty of Nürnberg, where small, thin versions called Schweinwurstel are grilled over open wood fires and served on pewter plates. It is not unusual for a patron to eat twelve to twenty-four of these grilled wursts at one sitting. Nürnberg’s Bratwurst-Herzle is the most famous restaurant featuring these sausages. It has been in existence since the fifteenth century and is about as charming an old restaurant as one can imagine. In other cities of Germany, restaurants featuring these grilled sausages are invariably called Nürnberger Bratwurstglöckl. Munich’s is especially good. Smoked, or geräucherte, Bratwurst, is a larger salami-like version that is steamed for about half an hour, then sliced and eaten hot or cold.</p>

  <p class="indent">Frankfurters are smoked and cooked, and though they <em>can</em> be <a id="page249"></a>eaten without further heating, they are generally steamed or grilled. They may be made of beef, pork or a combination of the two, and are usually seasoned with pepper and often with garlic. In Germany a very long, thin frankfurter is also known as a Polnischer, and when this same elongated version is bright red with paprika, it is called a Debreziner, after the Hungarian town Debrecen, which is its home.</p>

  <p class="indent">Bauernwurst looks like a large, fat frankfurter, usually made of pork; the meat is coarsely and unevenly ground. This “farmers’ wurst” is smoked and should be steamed for a few minutes and then grilled. It is highly seasoned and often contains mustard seeds.</p>

  <p class="indent">Knockwurst is a short, stubby, fat wurst that is also called a Regensburger, after the historic town which we call Ratisbon in English. It is made of beef and pork, or of beef alone, and is well seasoned with pepper and garlic. It may be steamed, but it is generally split or scored and grilled; it may also be cooked with lentils or sauerkraut.</p>

  <p class="indent">When it comes to liverwursts, German butchers offer an enormous choice, all of which are smoked and cooked and are eaten cold. Braunschweiger is made of pork and stuffed into a natural pork casing. Zwiebelwurst is liverwurst with bits of browned onions in it. Trüffelwurst is flavored with truffles, as you might guess. Sardellenwurst contains anchovies in its pork-meat mixture. One of the best of all is Hildesheimer Streichleberwurst, which is made with calves’ hver and is as good as any paté I have ever eaten. Of them all, however, perhaps the best-tasting and least known is Kasseler liverwurst, a coarse grind of pork hver and fat seasoned with garlic and herbs and absolutely wonderful when spread on rye bread. Fresh liverwurst (Frische Leberwurst) is served hot, as described.</p>

  <p class="indent">Mettwurst, or tea wurst, is a short, stubby pork sausage, bright red in color. It is completely cooked and is spread on bread, never sliced. Hamburger Mettwurst gets an additional cooking and is served in slices. Rügenwalder Mettwurst is a small, hard salami-like version of this sausage.</p>

  <p class="indent">Lyoner, or Fleischwurstring, “meat sausage ring,” is a circular wurst very close to our own baloney in flavor and texture. It may be made of beef or pork, or both, and is lightly smoked. Though it can be eaten as it comes from the store, it is almost always steamed for 20 minutes and then served hot or cold. Fleischwurst is the same filling in a long roll, instead of in a ring.</p>

  <p class="indent">Kolbascy is another ring-shaped sausage that originated in Poland and though similar to the Fleischwurst, it is cooked longer. Its meat is of a coarser, more uneven grind, and it contains more garlic. Kolbascy is often hung in the air and dried, in which case it is very much like salami.</p>

  <p class="indent">Blutwurst, or blood wurst, is made of fresh pig’s blood. It is sometimes sold completely cooked and smoked, and is then usually <a id="page250"></a>studded with bits of pork or veal tongue, diced fat and other bits of other meat. It is then called Zungenwurst (tongue wurst) or, if it is packed in a natural pork casing, Thüringer Blutwurst. Fresh bloodwurst (frische Blutwurst) is always cooked before it is served, and is eaten hot, as described.</p>

  <p class="indent">Schinkenwurst, or ham wurst, is a wide, smoked and cooked sausage containing pieces of ham in a pork baloney filling. We know it as ham baloney.</p>

  <p class="indent">In addition to the frankfurter, liverwurst and baloney type sausages, there are a number of smoked, cooked and dried salamis or cervelats in the German sausage collection. These are known as Dauerwürste, “hard sausages,” and can be kept for months if hung in a cool place. Any mold that may develop on the casing can be wiped off with a damp cloth. These sausages are used in hot weather and are also known as “summer sausage,” and are carried by hikers, campers and sportsmen on extended expeditions. They come in various sizes and with many different flavorings. There are tiny leathery strips called Jägerwurst (hunter’s sausage) and TV wurst for nibbling in front of the Late Late Show. Touristenwurst is a big ring-shaped salami and Bierwurst (beer sausage) and Plockwurst are among the medium-sized sticks.</p>

  <p class="indent">Pinkelwurst is a winter specialty of northern Germany. It is a sausage made of pork fat, oatmeal and seasonings and is cooked with kale, Pinkel mit Braunkohl (Pinkel with Kale) being a favorite dish in Schleswig-Holstein.</p>

  <p class="indent">There are also several versions of the meat, fat and spices in aspic which we group together under the name of “headcheese.” These include red or white Schwartenmagen, and Sülze, which has a slight sour tang to its jelly.</p>

  <p class="indent">Other enticing products sold in a German sausage shop include the raw, cured, ready-to-eat hams that are similar to Italian prosciutto. These include the famous Westphalian ham; Nusschinken, which derives its name from its smoky, nutlike flavor; Schinkenspeck, which is cured pork loin that is sliced and served like ham; Lachsschinken which is cut in pink, paper-thin slices that resemble smoked salmon, after which this meat is named; and Schwarzwalder Rauchfleisch—Black Forest smoked meat. This last is a cured bacon that is served with the rye Bauernbrot (farmers’ bread) throughout the Black Forest region for the mid-morning Vesper, the little meal that is not complete without a glass of the fragrant, fiery cherry brandy Kirschwasser. (See details on serving these hams.) Bundnerfleisch, the cured beef specialty of Switzerland, is also sold in these stores, as is the wonderful hot liver paté, Leberkäse, described in detail.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Bratwurst is one of the most popular and versatile of the German sausages. Link pork sausages are first cousins to this Nürnberg original, so even if there is no German sausage shop near you, your own butcher can supply you with a close approximation, or you will find it easy to make at home, by following this recipe.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">2 TO 4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 pound pork, preferably loin with just a little fat</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ pound lean veal</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>nutmeg</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>marjoram</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>caraway seeds</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 teaspoon salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ teaspoon pepper</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup cold water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>pork casings</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Grind pork and veal together twice, using the fine blade of a food chopper. Season with a pinch each of nutmeg, majoram, and caraway seeds that have been finely ground or powdered. Add salt, pepper and cold water and mix thoroughly. It is best to knead and mix this mass with your hands to be sure seasonings are thoroughly blended into meat. Fill casings and tie off in <span class="small">2½</span>“-lengths or shape the meat into patties as you would for hamburgers. Cook according to any of the Bratwurst recipes that follow. The patties can be pan-fried in a little butter or bacon fat.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">8 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>8 pairs Bratwurst (about 3 pounds)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>water to cover</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Prick sausages on all sides with a fork and arrange in a large heavy skillet with a cover. Pour water into skillet until sausages are covered. Cover skillet, bring water to a boil and simmer sausages 5 minutes. Drain off water and add butter to skillet. Fry sausages slowly in butter and turn frequently so they brown evenly on all sides. They will be thoroughly cooked in 20 minutes. These sausages may be served with apple rings or slices that have been browned in the butter in which the sausages were fried, or they may be topped with sautéed onion rings or the Brown Onion Sauce.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Grill Bratwurst over an open wood fire and you will have a very good approximation of how the Nürnberger Bratwurstglöckl is served in Germany.</p>

  <p class="indent">Although small Bratwurst (usually called Schweinwürstl) are best for this, the larger ones will do if they are all you can get. Prick wurst on all sides with a fork and parboil for 5 minutes. Drain and brush with melted butter or cooking oil and arrange on a long-handled metal grill. The wood fire should be very hot and burning low. Place grill right on grate of the barbecue pit, or hold 5 or 6 inches away from the white hot wood if you are cooking in a fireplace that has no grate. Broil sausages, turning rack frequently so they brown evenly on all sides. Brush with oil or melted butter once or twice during the broiling. They will be done in 10 minutes if you have the small Bratwurst, 15 to 20 minutes if you have the larger ones. You can, if you prefer, broil these without parboiling them, but add about 5 more minutes to the cooking time. You can also broil them over a charcoal fire. It’s not authentically Nürnberger, but they will taste delicious. Follow same directions for grilling the Bratwurst in the oven broiler.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 pairs Bratwurst (about 1½ pounds)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>boiling water to cover</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 small bay leaf</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 to 3 cups ale or light beer</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 heaping tablespoon minced onion</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>lemon and sugar (optional and to taste)</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Prick Bratwurst on all sides with a fork. Place in a large skillet with a cover and add enough boiling water to cover. Cover skillet and simmer 5 minutes. Drain off water. Add 2 tablespoons butter to skillet and brown wurst quickly on all sides. Add bay leaf and enough ale to cover sausages. Cover, bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 25 minutes. Remove cover and let ale boil rapidly until it is reduced by almost half. Reduce heat and simmer.</p>

  <p class="indent">Melt butter in a small skillet and sauté minced onion until golden <a id="page253"></a>brown. Blend in flour and sauté slowly until mixture is the color of cocoa. Add to the simmering ale and stir in until smoothly blended and thickened. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and a little lemon and sugar if you like a sweet-sour flavor.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2½ pounds potatoes</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 to 5 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 pairs Bratwurst or Weisswurst (about 1½ pounds)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>sweet mustard (preferably flavored with horseradish)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>melted butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 to 3 tablespoons cracker meal</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Peel and wash potatoes. Slice very thinly, and as uniformly as possible. If potato slices are not all the same thickness, some will be cooked while others remain raw. Soak in cold water 5 or 10 minutes and drain thoroughly on a paper towel. Arrange potatoes in a buttered baking dish, which should be about 11” or 12” in diameter and about 2” deep. Place potatoes in thin layers, topping each with a sprinkling of salt, pepper, grated cheese and dotting generously with butter. Sprinkle top layer with salt, pepper, grated cheese and dot with butter. Place in middle of 450° oven about 15 minutes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Meanwhile, parboil sausages 5 minutes. Cut lengthwise down center of each. Fill gash with mustard. When potatoes have baked 15 minutes, place sausages on top of them. Brush sausages with a little melted butter and sprinkle with grated cheese. Sprinkle cracker meal over sausages and top layer of potatoes. Bake another 20 minutes, still at 450°, until potatoes are soft and sausages are nicely browned on top. Serve directly from baking dish.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATION</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">For a richer, creamier version, divide only cup of butter between layers of potatoes, and pour 1 cup boiling milk over potatoes after they have been arranged in layers in baking dish. Top with parboiled, mustard-seasoned sausages at once, sprinkle with cheese and cracker meal and bake in a 425° oven 25 to 30 minutes, or until potatoes are soft and sausages are nicely browned on top.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>8 thick frankfurters (about ¾ to 1 pound)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>mustard</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 thin slices Emmenthaler or Gruyère cheese</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>8 strips of bacon</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Cut lengthwise gash down the center of each frankfurter but be careful not to cut all the way through the bottom as the halves should not separate. Spread each cut side with a little mustard. Cut cheese slices in half and place one in center of each frankfurter. The cheese slice should run the length of the gash. Blanch bacon in boiling water 3 or 4 minutes. Drain well and wrap a piece of bacon around each cheese-stuffed frankfurter. Fasten at both ends with toothpicks. Grill in oven broiler or on a long-handled metal grill over an open wood or charcoal fire. Broil 3 or 4 minutes on each side. These frankfurters can also be fried in a skillet that has been lightly greased with bacon fat.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¼ cup sour cream blended with 2 teaspoons flour salt</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Cut frankfurters or knockwursts into 1”-thick slices. Heat butter or lard in a 1½″-quart saucepan and in it sauté onions until soft and bright yellow. Do not let them brown. Add paprika and caraway seeds and sauté another 3 to 4 minutes. Add vinegar and frankfurter slices and stir over low heat until frankfurters are well coated with spices. Add tomato juice or meat stock, cover, bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes. Stir in sour cream and season to taste. Heat thoroughly but do not boil.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. Half a green pepper, finely diced, can be sautéed along with onions.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. If you would like to make this a “meal in one pot,” add 2 cups cold, <a id="page255"></a>boiled cubed potatoes, just before you add the tomato juice or stock. The potatoes will heat through as wurst cooks.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Fresh liverwurst is heated the same way as blood wurst (above). It is either steamed, or steamed and fried with onions, and it is often served in a combination of the two : liverwurst and blood wurst, each steamed and then fried with some onions, in separate pans. The blood wurst and onions are placed in the center of the dish and a ring of liverwurst and onions is placed around that.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Leberkäse is one of Germany’s greatest delicacies, and though it is known and appreciated all over the country, you will come across it most often at snack stands in Bavaria. Literally translated, it means “liver cheese,” but it is really a very smooth meat and liver paté with the consistency of a soft, very fine and slightly porous baloney-type sausage. It is steamed and served hot, with a little mustard and a wedge of crusty rye bread or a rye roll. Fleischkäse, should you come across the term, is almost indistinguishable from Leberkäse. It is usually a coarser blend of less expensive meat and is therefore a little cheaper to buy. Since it takes the kind of grinder used by commercial sausage butchers to get the meat smooth enough and sufficiently well blended for an authentic Leberkäse, this product is almost always purchased from sausage shops. It also requires a special steamer to cook it. However, it can be approximated at home, in case you cannot get the real thing.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2½ pounds lean pork, ground</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 quart ice water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1½ pounds pork liver</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 onion</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 clove garlic</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ pound unsliced bacon, finely diced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 eggs</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 teaspoon pepper</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 teaspoons saltpeter (you can get this from a druggist)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 teaspoon sugar</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Place ground pork on a cutting board or in a very large bowl. Gradually work ice water into meat. To do this, pour a little water onto meat <a id="page257"></a>and knead with both hands until water is absorbed. If you do this very slowly and carefully, you should be able to work the entire quart of water into the 2½ pounds of pork. The smoothness of the paté depends upon this operation. Grind pork hver, onion and garlic together, twice, using the finest blade of a food chopper. Mix ground pork with ground hver mixture, diced bacon and remaining ingredients. Mix well until very thoroughly blended.</p>

  <p class="indent">Grease one or two loaf pans. Pack paté mixture in pans until each is almost full. It is not necessary to leave more than 1” of space at the top. Brush top of meat with cold water until smooth and glossy. Set loaf pan in a larger pan of hot water. The water should come about halfway up the sides of the pan. Bake in lower third of a 350° oven <em>2½</em> to 3 hours, or until paté is cooked solid and is white throughout.</p>

  <p class="indent">Leberkäse may be served directly from the oven or it may be stored in the refrigerator until you want to use it. It may be eaten cold, but it is much better hot. To heat, remove from refrigerator about 30 to 45 minutes before serving time. Cut off as many slices as you will need and heat in a vegetable steamer if you have one, or in the top of a double boiler that is set over simmering water about 30 minutes, or until meat slices are heated thoroughly.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATION</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Cut Leberkäse in 1”-thick slices and fry slowly in butter with some onion rings, until meat is brown on both sides and onions are soft and golden. Serve Leberkäse slices topped with onion rings.</p>
