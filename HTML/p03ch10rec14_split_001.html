<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Young Luis Bertran Bittini Martinez teaches at the biggest cooking school in Madrid. It is part of the Fundación Tomillo (</span>tomillo <span class="italic">means “thyme”), an independent nonprofit organization whose aim is to be of service to society in many different fields. It teaches dropouts, adolescents who have been expelled from school, youths in trouble with the police, the unemployed, handicapped people, and elderly people who wish to remain independent. Luis teaches youths between the ages of sixteen and twenty-one who want to be professional cooks. At the time he invited my friend Alicia and me to lunch at his house, many of his students happened to be Latin American, from Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru. The year before, they had mostly been Moroccan. He said that when he comes into the class, the students jokingly intone, “Right! Onion, garlic, pepper, tomato!” It is the way so many Spanish dishes start. As we watched him prepare the meal, he told us about what he was teaching. While we ate, his father, Rafael Bittini, told us about how it was when he was young, and Luis’s wife told us that young people now bought ready-cooked pasta dishes to heat up.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Use boneless beef shin, brisket, or flank, chuck, blade, or skirt steak. Luis cooked the meat in a sweet Spanish white wine but said that we could use port or red wine. I used a cheap port and it made a splendid sauce. If you want to cook the stew in the oven, use a casserole that can go on the stovetop and also in the oven. Serve it with mashed potatoes (page 281).</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">6 to 8 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">1 large onion, coarsely chopped</p>
<p class="qun">1 red or green bell pepper, cored, seeded, and diced</p>
<p class="qun">1 carrot, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">1 leek, trimmed, washed, and chopped</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">1 tomato, peeled and chopped</p>
<p class="qun">2 pounds boneless beef (see headnote on page 417), cut into 1¼-inch cubes</p>
<p class="qun">About 2 cups sweet red wine or port</p>
<p class="qun1">2 bay leaves</p>
<p class="recsum">Heat 3 to 4 tablespoons of the oil in a wide casserole. Put in the onion, pepper, carrot, and leek and sauté for about 25 minutes, first over low heat until softened, then over medium heat to brown and caramelize them a little. Turn them often and season with salt and pepper. Add the tomato and cook for a few minutes more.</p>
<p class="summary">Meanwhile, heat 3 tablespoons of the oil and brown the meat on all sides in a large skillet over high heat; do this in batches, adding more oil if necessary—if the meat is crowded, it will stew rather than brown. Lift the pieces out as they are browned and add them to the vegetables.</p>
<p class="summary">Pour the wine into the casserole, add enough water to cover and the bay leaves, and season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="summary">Cook, covered, over very low heat, at a bare simmer, for 2 to 3 hours, adding water as necessary to keep the meat covered, until the meat is very tender, stirring once in a while to make sure that it does not burn at the bottom. If there is too much liquid at the end, remove the lid to reduce the sauce.</p>
<p class="summary">Luis lifted out the meat and blended the sauce to a cream with an immersion blender, but he said it is not necessary to do that. I like to leave the sauce as it is.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATIONS</span></p>
<p class="bl-first">• Alternatively, put the casserole, with the lid on, in a preheated 325°F oven and cook for 2½ to 3 hours.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• For a version from the Pyrenee mountains, use 1 cup red wine and ½ cup brandy instead of the sweet wine. Pour the wine into the pot with the water. Heat the brandy in a small pan and carefully light it with a long match. Let the flames die down, then pour it into the pot. Add 2 cinnamon sticks and 5 cloves.</p>
<p class="bl-last">• For an <span class="italic">estofado de toro con chocolate</span> from Navarre, add 1 tablespoon grated bittersweet chocolate, ¼ cup red or white wine vinegar, and 2 cinnamon sticks. Toward the end, add 1 pound new potatoes, peeled, boiled, and halved, to heat through.</p>
