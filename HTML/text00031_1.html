<p class="first_paragraph" id="nad0002622">I’m not always sure how I feel about lunch. It’s that moment right in the middle of the day when we’re often too busy to stop what we’re doing, and then the instant it’s over we’re already far too busy thinking about what we fancy for dinner. It’s like the middle child of the food world, doesn’t quite know where it belongs. But what I do know is that it’s a vital part of the day and actually very important. For all those middle children out there (don’t worry, I’m one too), it’s time we realized you are worth stopping for, you are worth some embellishment, and you are there to help us remember why it’s good to pause and take a breath. Here is a collection of simple lunch recipes that are easy, satisfying and – most of all – worth stopping for.</p>
