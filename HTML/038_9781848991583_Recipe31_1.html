<p class="normal"><b>Szechuan peppercorns have a big, bold flavor, yet they are seldom used outside Chinese cooking. This fragrant spice works well with quail—which for me is a much underused meat—but make sure you toast it well first.</b></p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">SERVES</span></b> 4</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 30 minutes, plus making the croutons</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 40 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 quail, about 5 ounces each, gutted and cleaned</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 cup plus 2 tablepoons duck or goose fat</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 quail eggs</p>
<p class="acktxt">12 baby zucchini, sliced into thin ribbons using a vegetable peeler</p>
<p class="acktxt">leaves from 1 thyme sprig</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon honey</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon soy sauce</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ teaspoon Szechuan peppercorns, toasted and crushed (see <a href="051_9781848991583_Recipe44.html#pageid_68">page 68</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 small or 1 large head Belgian endive, sliced crosswise</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 handful Croutons (see <a href="013_9781848991583_Recipe7.html">page 18</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 handful flat-leaf parsley leaves, chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Prepare the quail by removing the legs and breasts from each one, or ask your butcher to do this for you. Wrap each leg tightly in plastic wrap and then aluminum foil. (Leave the breasts to one side, covered.) Melt the duck fat in a saucepan over low heat until it is starting to shimmer. Add the foil-wrapped legs and return the fat to a shimmer. Cook 20 to 25 minutes until they are cooked through and tender. Remove the pan from the heat and leave the legs to one side in the fat.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Meanwhile, bring a small saucepan of water to a boil. Add the quail eggs and cook 2 minutes, then drain and refresh them in ice water—the yolks should still be slightly runny. Peel the eggs and leave to one side.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Put the zucchini ribbons in a bowl with the thyme and oil, season with salt and turn until coated. Heat a ridged griddle pan over high heat until very hot, then griddle the zucchini in batches 1 to 2 minutes, turning over once, until charred in places. Transfer to a plate, cover and keep warm.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Unwrap the quail legs and brush with half the honey. Heat a large skillet over high heat. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of the duck fat from the other pan, then add the quail legs, skin-side down, and cook 2 to 3 minutes until the skin is crisp and golden brown. Transfer them to a plate, cover with foil and leave to rest while you cook the breasts.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> Season the quail breasts with salt and pepper. Put them in the skillet, skin-side down, and cook over high heat 2 to 3 minutes until the skin starts to crisp. Turn the breasts over and cook 2 minutes longer until cooked through but still nicely moist. Transfer them to the plate with the legs. Pour the rice wine vinegar and soy sauce into the pan and deglaze by stirring to remove any caramelized bits stuck to the bottom. Stir in the Szechuan peppercorns and remaining honey and heat briefly. Before the honey starts to color, add the quail legs and turn to coat them in the honey glaze, then remove and add the breasts to the pan, skin-side down only, and glaze until they are a lovely golden color.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>6</b> Cut the quail breasts in half diagonally, then put on top of the Belgian endive and the zucchini ribbons with the legs. Halve the quail eggs and put on top, then sprinkle with the croutons and parsley. Drizzle with any glaze left in the pan and serve immediately.</p>
