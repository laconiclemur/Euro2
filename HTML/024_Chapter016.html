  <p class="h3">Pepper Cookie House (Pepperkakehus)</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/126-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent">This delightful little cookie house is just a little bigger than 7” x 5 ½”. The dough is easy to work with and it has a tangy, delicious flavor. Leftover dough can be made into gingerbread men or other fun characters. Smart folks would make several of these quaint little houses. Making these pepper cookie houses is a grand way of sharing the joy of the advent season with both family and friends.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">¾ cup (1 ¾ dl) Lyle’s Golden Syrup</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tsp. pomegranate peel</p>

  <p class="ing">6 tbsp. butter</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tsp. ginger</p>

  <p class="ing">½ cup (1 ⅛ dl) sugar</p>

  <p class="ing">½ tsp. pepper</p>

  <p class="ing">½ cup (1 ⅛ dl) milk, evaporated</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tsp. baking powder</p>

  <p class="ingl">3 cups (7 ¾ dl) flour</p>

  <p class="noindent">Bring syrup, butter, sugar, and evaporated milk to a boil. Cool. Sift remaining ingredients together and add to syrup mixture. Cover dough well and chill a couple hours. Trace and cut out house pattern. Roll the dough out too ⅛-inch thickness and place directly on a lightly-greased cookie sheet. Place traced pattern on top and cut out all the pieces with a sharp knife. Note: number of pieces for each pattern. Remember to cut out openings for the door and windows. Bake in an oven at 350ºF (175ºC) for approximately 10 minutes. Place on a rack to cool.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Decoration:</p>

  <p class="ing">2 cups (4 ½ dl) confectioners’ sugar</p>

  <p class="ing">½ tsp. lemon extract</p>

  <p class="ing">¼ tsp. cream of tartar</p>

  <p class="ingl">1 egg white</p>

  <p class="noindent">Place all ingredients in a bowl and beat with an electric mixer until stiff. Keep covered with a damp cloth at all times to keep crust from forming. Place in a decorating tube and decorate the house. Have a nice assortment of candies for the children to use their imagination while decorating. All decorations must be thoroughly dry before the house is “glued” together.</p>

  <p class="img"><a id="page_127"/><img alt="images" src="../Images/127-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_128"/>Building the pepper cookie house:</p>

  <p class="noindent">Have a sturdy foundation for the house ready. Melt ½ cup (¾ dl) sugar over low heat until it becomes golden brown; watch carefully so it does not burn. Do not stir until ready. One at a time, dip the edges of the house in the melted sugar and glue together. Remember the melted sugar is extremely HOT. You must not let the children do this part. Cover the joints with added frosting. If you desire, you may use the decorating frosting to glue the house together.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="bold">Pepper cookies:</span> Make cookies with the remaining dough and decorate with the frosting. You can build a fence, make animals, or create standard pepper cookies and decorate them all. Share and have fun.</p>

  <p class="cap1"><span class="italic">My sister Eva’s favorite standby for many years. Easily altered by using fruit of your choice. Apricots or apricot jam is an excellent addition.</span></p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">6 eggs</p>

  <p class="ing">1 cup (2 ½ dl) sugar</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tbsp. water</p>

  <p class="ing">1 cup (2 ½ dl) flour</p>

  <p class="ing">6 oz. (170 g.) raspberry jam</p>

  <p class="ing">2 bananas, sliced</p>

  <p class="ing">1 orange</p>

  <p class="ing5">Frosting:</p>

  <p class="ingl">1 ½ cups (3 ¾ dl) whipping cream</p>

  <p class="noindent">Preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C). Beat eggs and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the water. Sift dry ingredients together and fold into the egg mixture, mixing well. Pour into a 10-inch (25-cm) greased spring-form pan. Bake 40 minutes. Cool on a cake rack. When completely cool, divide horizontally into two layers. Sprinkle layers with freshly squeezed orange juice. Place the bottom layer on a platter, baked-side down.

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_129"/>Cloudberry Cream Cake (Multebløtkake)</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/129-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="credit">Photo credit: Forma A/S</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">5 eggs</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ⅛ cups (2 ½ dl) flour</p>

  <p class="ing">½ cup (2 ¼ dl) sugar</p>

  <p class="ingl">½ tsp. baking powder</p>

  <p class="noindent">Beat egg and sugar until light and fluffy, like eggedosis. To test the consistency, the eggedosis should be firm enough for you to write three letters of the alphabet from what drips from the beater. If the letters do not spread the batter is the right consistency. Sift in the flour and baking powder and use a spatula to fold it carefully into the eggedosis. Pour into a greased 10-inch spring-form pan. Bake at 370ºF (185ºC) on the lowest rack for 40–50 minutes, or until the cake springs back when touched in the center. Remove from the oven. Let the cake cook in the pan for a few minutes before removing it to a cooling rack. When cool, divide into three layers. For easier cutting, freeze slightly before dividing. Mark the cake with toothpicks to help you cut a straight line.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Filling and decorations:</p>

  <p class="ing">3 ½ cups (8 dl) heavy cream, whipped</p>

  <p class="ing">1 lb. (450 g.) marzipan</p>

  <p class="ing">10–12 oz. (3 ½ dl) sweetened cloudberries or cloudberry jam</p>

  <p class="ing">Red and yellow food coloring, blended</p>

  <p class="ing">Peppermint leaves, fresh</p>

  <p class="ing">2–3 tbsp. milk</p>

  <p class="ingl">Confectioners’ sugar</p>

  <p class="noindent">Sprinkle cake layers with milk. Blend cloudberries or jam with ⅔ of the whipped cream. Place the bottom layer of the cake baked side down on the platter. Spread with the cloudberry cream mixture. Top with the middle layer of the cake and spread with the remainder of the mixture. End with the top layer bake-side up. Spread the cake’s sides and top with the remainder of the whipped cream.</p>

  <p class="indent">Color ¼ of the marzipan orange and roll out into a circle about 11 inches in diameter. Place on top of the cake. Cover with a 6-inch circle of parchment paper or wax paper. Roll out the white marzipan large enough to cover the top and sides of the cake. In the center cut the marzipan into eight even pie-shaped wedges, but do not cut all the way to the cake’s edge. The parchment paper prevents you from cutting through the orange layer of marzipan underneath. Starting with one tip in the center, roll one wedge at a time away from the center point, forming a scroll. Remove the parchment paper with a fork. Place some fresh cloudberries in the center and around the scroll or decorate with marzipan roses and fresh peppermint leaves. Lightly sprinkle confectioners’ sugar on top.</p>

  <p class="h3">Autumn Cake (Høstkake)</p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="italic">This cake has become very popular in Norway, and serving it is a great way to welcome the autumn. You will receive accolades every time you serve it.</span></p>

  <p class="noindent1">Although it may be enjoyed for singular occasions, it may also be enjoyed any time of the year by substituting blueberries and strawberries for lingonberries and cloudberries. It reaches the peak of its flavor if refrigerated up to 24 hours before serving.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">6 eggs</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ¼ cups (3 dl) flour</p>

  <p class="ing">1 cup (2 ½ dl) sugar</p>

  <p class="ing">Confectioners’ sugar to taste</p>

  <p class="ing">3 cups (7 ½ dl) cloudberries</p>

  <p class="ing5">Garnish:</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ⅔ lbs. (750 g.) marzipan</p>

  <p class="ing">Yellow food coloring</p>

  <p class="ing5">Wine jelly:</p>

  <p class="ing">Juice of ½ lemon</p>

  <p class="ing">¾ cup (1 ¾ dl) white wine or white grape juice</p>

  <p class="ingl">Sugar to taste</p>

  <p class="noindent">Preheat the oven to 340°F (170°C). Beat eggs and sugar until light and fluffy. Combine flour and baking powder and sift over the egg mixture, and carefully fold in. Pour into a 10-inch (25-cm) spring-form pan. Bake on the lowest rack in the oven about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool on a rack. When completely cold, divide horizontally into three layers. Reserve a small amount of each berry for decoration. Mash the remaining berries separately. Sweeten to taste with confectioners’ sugar.</p>

  <p class="indent">Whip the cream. Reserve a small amount of whipped cream for decoration. Mix half the cream with the lingonberry purée, the remaining half with the cloudberry purée. Place the bottom layer of the cake, baked-side down, on a platter. Spread with lingonberry cream. Top with the middle layer of the cake and spread with cloudberry cream. End with the top layer baked-side up. Spread with a thin layer of whipped cream.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cut a circle of parchment paper slightly smaller than the cake and place on top of the cake. Roll out most of the marzipan to a round sheet, big enough to cover the top and sides, and place over the cake. In the center cut the marzipan into twelve pie-shaped wedges, but do not cut all the way out to the edge of the cake. Starting with the tip, roll one <a id="page_131"/>wedge at a time away from the center point, forming a scroll. Remove the parchment paper with a fork. Spoon the reserved lingonberries into the center, surround them with the cloudberries, and spread to the marzipan scrolls.</p>

  <p class="indent">Sprinkle 3 tbsp. cold water over the gelatin. Let stand for 2 minutes to soften, then heat until thoroughly dissolved. Combine wine or grape juice and lemon juice and sweeten to taste. Stir in the gelatin. Strain. Refrigerate until just beginning to set. Spoon carefully over the berries. Smooth out with a knife dipped in boiling water. Color the remaining marzipan yellow. Roll into a strip and place it around the bottom of the cake. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Just before serving, sprinkle lightly with sifted confectioners’ sugar.</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ¾ cups (4 dl) whipping cream</p>

  <p class="ingl">Lemon balm or peppermint leaves</p>

  <p class="noindent">Make two recipes of jelly rolls. Grate and add chocolate with the flour before blending with the eggs. (The chocolate may be doubled if desired.) Spread lingonberry jam evenly across the cakes. Cut each cake in 2 ¾-inch (7-cm) wide strips. Roll the first strip together tightly. Add the next strip on the outside of the first one, continuing to roll snugly until the last strip from both cakes is used up (snowball principle). Place on a large platter and sprinkle the cake with currant juice. Whip the cream until thick and glossy. Use a decorating tube to decorate the cake with the whipped cream, and add some lemon balm or mint leaves around the lower edge. See picture.</p>

Sprinkle with almonds, currants, and sugar. Press the garnish <span class="italic">lightly</span> into the batter so it does not fall off when the cake is done. Bake on the middle rack of the oven at 375°F (190°C) for 20–25 minutes. The cake should be light golden and baked through, but not dry. Remove it from the oven as soon as no batter sticks to an inserted cake tester. Cool slightly on a cake rack. Cover cake with waxed paper and a cookie sheet and turn the cake pan upside down on the sheet. Place a wire rack on the upturned cake and turn again so the cake rests right-side up on the rack. Cool the cake on the wire rack. When the cake is cold, cut in diamond shapes with a very sharp knife.</p>

  <p class="h3">Danish Pastry (Wienerbrød)</p>

  <p class="noindent">I dislike the name “Danish” because what Americans think of as “Danish” is a sad imitation, not comparable to the delectable <span class="italic">wienerbrød</span> made in Scandinavia. <span class="italic">Wiener</span> means Viennese (man), and <span class="italic">brød</span> means bread. That does not explain the flaky heavenly pastry Scandinavians call <span class="italic">wienerbrød</span>; however, once you have tasted <span class="italic">wienerbrød</span>, it does not matter. But knowing what true “Danish” is, you likely will share them with friends repeatedly.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ⅞ cups (250 g.) flour</p>

  <p class="ing">½ cup (1 ¼ dl) milk, cold</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tbsp. sugar</p>

  <p class="ing">1 egg</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tbsp. margarine</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ⅞ cups (200 g.) butter or margarine</p>

  <p class="ingl">1 pkg. active dry yeast</p>

  <p class="noindent">Sift together the flour and sugar. Cut in 1 tablespoon margarine; it will prevent the dough from becoming leathery. Add the yeast to cold milk and let it dissolve. Add the yeast mixture and egg to the flour. <span class="italic">Lightly mix the ingredients. The dough will be extremely soft.</span> Chill 15 minutes. In a cool place, quickly roll the dough out to a large square, ¼-inch (½-cm) thick, using as little flour as possible. Use a cheese knife to thinly slice the butter and place on ⅓ of the dough, approx. ¾ inch (2 cm) from the edge. Fold the ⅓ unbuttered part over ⅓ of the buttered dough, and the remaining ⅓ over on top. Repeat crosswise. Roll the dough out and repeat the folding two or more times or until the margarine is distributed evenly. This gives you a flaky pastry. It is important that the margarine does not ooze out. If it does the dough will become sticky and difficult to roll out, and the finished product will be a disappointment. Bake in a preheated oven at 475°F (245°C) for 15 minutes.</p>

  <p class="ing">½ tsp. salt</p>

  <p class="ing">1 qt. (liter) flour or enough flour to make smooth, pliant dough</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ½ tsp. cardamom</p>

  <p class="ingl">Egg for brushing</p>

  <p class="noindent">Heat the milk until lukewarm. Pour into a mixing bowl and stir in the remaining ingredients except flour. Stir in a little flour at a time until the dough is smooth and elastic. Place in a greased bowl, cover, and set aside to rise in a warm place until double in bulk. On well-floured pastry cloth, turn the dough out and knead very lightly. Divide into eighteen portions. Form each portion into a ball by placing your hand in a cupped shape over the ball, pressing down while making a large circle with your hand. As you roll the ball let up on the weight little by little, allowing the dough to form into a smooth ball. Slit a pocket. With a spoon dipped in water, fill each pocket with almond filling, then seal back up. Place balls apart on a greased cookie sheet, cover, and let rise 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Brush buns with beaten egg, which allows them to rise without cracking and gives them a smooth finish. Bake for 15 minutes. Cool on a wire rack. To leave plain, read the directions but ignore the filling instructions, or add other suggested fillings.</p>

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_142"/>The World’s Best (Verdens beste)</p>

  <p class="noindent">This cake is also known as the <span class="italic">Kvæfjord</span> cake. When I think of Kvæfjord close to Tromsø, fresh fish, lefse, and game come to mind. A little curious such a celebrated cake should originate in rugged northern Norway. There are numerous versions of this recipe. This is my favorite. The Norwegians call it <span class="italic">vidunderlig!</span>—wonderful! You be the judge.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">⅝ cup (150 g.) generous butter or margarine</p>

  <p class="ing">¾ cup (150 g.) sugar</p>

  <p class="ing">5 egg yolks</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tsp. baking powder</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ⅛ cups (150 g.) flour</p>

  <p class="ing">4 tbsp. milk</p>

  <p class="ing1">Meringue:</p>

  <p class="ing">5 egg whites</p>

  <p class="ing">1 cup (200 g.) sugar</p>

  <p class="ing">⅓ cup (50 g.) almonds, chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">Filling:</p>

  <p class="ing">1 small pkg. vanilla pudding</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ¼ cups (3 ½ dl) milk</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ¼ cups (3 dl) whipping cream</p>

  <p class="ingl">1 tsp. rum extract</p>

  <p class="noindent">Cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg yolks one at a time. Sift the baking powder with the flour and add alternately with the milk. Line an 8×12-inch (20×30-cm) pan with parchment or wax paper and grease well. Pour the batter in and smooth the top. Beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry. Gradually add the sugar and beat until stiff and glossy. Spread the meringue over the cake batter. Sprinkle with chopped almonds. Bake in a preheated 355°F (180°C) oven until golden. Prepare double recipe of vanilla pudding. Add rum flavoring, and carefully fold the whipped cream into the pudding. Cut the cake in two horizontally and spread with the filling. Replace the top. Keep chilled until serving time.</p>

  <p class="h3">Almond Tower Cake (Kransekake)</p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="italic">Kransekake reigns supreme in Norway. Weddings, birthdays, promotions, holidays—it is always there. Don’t shy away from making this delicacy. It is not difficult—honestly—just a little time consuming. Follow the directions, do exactly what they say, and soon you can sparkle with pride, knowing you have made the most traditional of Norwegian cakes!</span></p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/142-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Kransekake</span> is just plain fun to make and decorate. Here are two tips: almonds used must be of the best quality. Many prefer to blanch them, which makes the cake lighter in appearance. Leaving the almonds unblanced will make a darker cake, though richer in flavor. I prefer unblanched almonds, but you might like to try half and half.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Decorations:</span> Norwegian flags are a must. The traditional <span class="italic">knallbonboner</span>, party crackers—frilly party favors—are very expensive and hard to find. You can decorate the cake in another beautiful way, with marzipan flowers (see picture). Make them from the same <span class="italic">kransekake</span> dough, omitting the flour and not baking, or use fancy wrapped <span class="italic">konfekt</span>, chocolates. Secure all decorations with a light caramel sauce. Decorations on the cake should be rather uniform. The cake should not be loaded down, but simple and elegant.</p>

  <p class="indent">Many think of <span class="italic">kransekake</span> only in its traditional form—the tower shape—but one can make varied shapes such as baskets, logs, or horns of plenty. <span class="italic">Kransekake</span> keeps well in an airtight container. Adding a raw, peeled potato or a fresh piece of bread to <a id="page_143"/>the container will result in a chewy cake. The cake may also be frozen; when defrosted, the cake will be chewy from the moisture. Prepare and bake the <span class="italic">kransekake</span> rings in advance and freeze. Remove from freezer in time to defrost and decorate before serving.</p>

  <p class="indent">Please read all directions before proceeding. This recipe makes a 16-ring cake. If you do not have <span class="italic">kransekake</span> pans, don’t despair. Prepare the dough according to the directions. Cut into the proper sizes and form rings—the smallest should be 5 ½ inches (14 cm) with each additional ring a scant ¾-inch (2-cm) larger. Cover a cookie sheet with aluminum foil, grease well, and place rings on top.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">5 ½ cups (13 ½ dl) almonds, ground, left as is, or blanched</p>

  <p class="ing">4 egg whites, slightly beaten</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tbsp. flour</p>

  <p class="ingl">5 ½ cups (13 ½ dl) confectioners’ sugar</p>

  <p class="noindent">Grind the thoroughly washed and dried almonds. (If you choose to blanch the almonds, pour boiling water over them, then place in a steamer over simmering water until the hulls loosen and become easy to remove. Do not let the almonds boil; they will lose their flavor and become leathery.) For good results, it is important to work with thoroughly dry almonds. Let them stand covered for at least 24 hours or dry them in a medium-hot oven, being careful not to overdo.</p>

  <p class="indent">Grind almonds a second time with the confectioners’ sugar. Add slightly beaten egg whites a little at a time and mix well. Take care that the mixture does not become too moist; it will rise to excess, become porous, and, as a result, be difficult to remove from the pan. This can be remedied by the addition of a little flour and confectioners’ sugar. On the other hand, if the cake is not moist enough, the cake will not rise and will turn hard and dry. In this case, add a little egg white. It is advisable to test by first baking a small sample.</p>

  <p class="indent">Before you begin, let the dough rest, preferably covered, at least 10 minutes or even until the next day. This will make working with it easier. Grease ring-shaped pans with unsalted butter or cooking oil and sprinkle with a little Cream of Wheat. Roll out small portions (finger thickness) to fit the rings. Cut the edges with a knife and butt edges to form a perfect circle. This will ensure a balanced finished product. Bake the rings on a cookie sheet in the middle of the oven at 300°F (150°C). Do <span class="italic">not</span> over bake. Cool quickly, preferably in a drafty area. When almost cool, carefully slide the cake from the pans. With a pastry brush, remove any excess Cream of Wheat.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Frosting:</p>

  <p class="ing">1 cup (2 ½ dl) confectioners’ sugar</p>

  <p class="ing">½ tsp. white vinegar</p>

  <p class="ingl">1 egg white, slightly beaten</p>

  <p class="noindent">Stir the vinegar and egg white into the confectioners’ sugar until the frosting is thick enough to be used in a cake decorator. Decorate one ring at a time with a zigzag pattern, making sure the pattern reaches well over the edge of each ring. When the rings are stacked, one over the other, the extra icing serves as an adhesive. Make leaves and roses, or other flowers, from marzipan, or decorate <span class="italic">kransekake</span> with party crackers or fancy wrapped chocolates. Attach decorations with caramel. Add small flags. When serving <span class="italic">kransekake</span> remove the lower rings and break into serving-size pieces.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Caramel:</span> The amount you need to make depends on how many decorations you are adding to your <span class="italic">kransekake</span>. Two to four tablespoons of sugar should be sufficient. It is easiest to make caramel in a frying pan. Warm the pan over low heat then add the sugar. It is best not to stir until the sugar is melted because lumps form easily and are difficult to melt. When melted, keep caramel warm while attaching decorations. The candy hardens almost instantly when cooled.</p>

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_144"/>Wedding Cake (Bryllupskake)</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/144-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent1">Times change, and today many use this type of contemporary wedding cake. Though not an old traditional cake, it will please the most discriminating wedding couples and all their guests. The horseshoes topping the cake are made from white chocolate. They stand for good luck in Norway.</p>

  <p class="indent">When you want something superbly delicious, just cut the recipe in half, or thirds, and you will have a cake that will bring memorable moments to any occasion. This cake is baked in 7–8 ½- and 11-inch (18–22- and 28-cm) round springform pans. It is best to make the cake in two batches. Divide the dough in two. One portion will fit the two smallest pans, and the other half the largest pan. The almonds are weighed after they have been scalded. Read the recipe through before beginning to make this cake.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">16 eggs</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ⅓ cups (200 g.) flour</p>

  <p class="ing">2 cups (5 dl) sugar</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tsp. baking powder</p>

  <p class="ingl">1 ½ cups (200 g.) almonds, blanched and ground</p>

  <p class="noindent">Grease the pans and cover the bottom with parchment paper. Whip eggs and sugar to <span class="italic">eggedosis</span> consistency—light and fluffy. Carefully fold in the thoroughly ground almonds, and add flour that has been sifted with the baking powder. Divide the batter into the proper size pans. The smallest pans takes about 30 minutes to bake, medium 35–40 minutes, and large from 50–60 minutes. When baked cool on a rack.</p>

  <p class="noindent1">Filling and decoration:</p>

  <p class="ing">¾–1 ¼ cups (2–3 dl) sparkling apple juice, such as Martinelli</p>

  <p class="ing">2 qts. (liters) whipping cream</p>

  <p class="ing">3 tbsp. sugar</p>

  <p class="ing">2 cups (5 dl) thick apricot jam, lightly sweetened</p>

  <p class="ing">4 ⅜ lbs. (2 kg.) marzipan, approx.</p>

  <p class="ing">Red and green food coloring</p>

  <p class="ing">4–5 Freia Daim chocolates, or substitute</p>

  <p class="ing">7–8 1.5-oz. Heath bars</p>

  <p class="ingl">Bridal couple or white chocolate decoration</p>

  <p class="noindent">See Marzipan Topping, or purchase almond paste and follow the direction on the package. Divide all the cakes horizontally in two or three layers. It is easier to divide the cakes if they are partially frozen. Sprinkle sparkling apple cider on all the layers and spread with a thin layer of jam. Chill the bowl and the beaters before whipping the cream. Whip about 2 cups of cream at a time (adding a little sugar to each batch). Add coarsely-chopped chocolates to half of the whipped cream. Fill the cakes with the chocolate cream, spreading it evenly over one layer of each of the three different sizes of cakes. Top with the second layer of cake, bottom-side up, and cover all three cakes on the top and sides with the remaining whipped cream.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Marzipan cover:</span> Keep marzipan at room temperature and roll out enough marzipan to cover the top and side of one cake at a time, a scant ¼-inch (5-mm) thick. If needed, use a little confectioners’ sugar to help with the rolling out. The sugar can be easily brushed off with a pastry brush.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Place the cakes on a three tier cake stand, beginning with the largest on the bottom. Fill a decorator tube with whipped cream and decorate the three cakes with stars (see Wedding Cake photograph above). Make marzipan roses (in different sizes) and leaves <a id="page_145"/>and finish decorating the cake according to the picture. Top the cake with your desired decoration.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Roses and leaves:</span> Color approximately ¼ of the marzipan with red and green food coloring (mostly red for the roses). Do not add too much food coloring at one time; you want a soft pink color. You can always add more if needed. To obtain a more natural green add 1 drop of blue for every two drops of green. Again, add a little at a time; you cannot remove the color once it is added. Roll green marzipan out and cut out leaves and mark veins with candy tools, a toothpick, or a knife. It is a good idea to at least make the roses and leaves a couple of days ahead of time. They keep well in airtight tins.</p>

  <p class="indent">Roll pink marzipan out as thinly as possible. Cut into 5–6-inch (13–15-cm) long ribbons; the width depends on how big you want the rose to be. At one end start rolling up the ribbon, a little tight at the beginning and loosing it up as you go, allowing the center portion to protrude slightly in some roses and to recess in others. Bend the outer layer outward to resemble the configuration of a rose.</p>

  <p class="h3">Norway’s Grand Fruit Pie (Norges storartet fruktpie)</p>

  <p class="noindent">For inspiration see the photo. Follow the easy steps to make this mouth-watering fruit pie. Large enough to serve 12 people.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/145-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="ing1">Pie Dough:</p>

  <p class="ing">½–⅝ cup (120–160 g.) margarine</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ⅛–1 ½ cups (150–200 g.) flour</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ½–2 tbsp. sugar</p>

  <p class="ingl">3–5 tbsp. water, cold</p>

  <p class="noindent">Be sure to use only chilled utensils as this pie dough must not get warm; use your hands as little as possible. Cut chilled margarine into 1-inch (2 ½-cm) squares. Place margarine, sugar, and flour in a medium-sized bowl and cut margarine in with a pastry blender. Then gather it all quickly together with your fingertips. Add the cold water, a little at a time, using your fingers to form the dough. It should be pliant and smooth, not grainy and moist. Divide the dough in fourths. Take one piece and place on the counter. Place the heel of your hand on the dough and with one stroke, press and stretch out the dough. Scrape the dough up with a scraper and set aside. Repeat with the remaining pieces. Gather up all the dough, sprinkling a little flour on top. Wrap in plastic wrap and cool in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Remove the dough and gently press into 9–12-inch (23–30-cm) tart pan with a removable bottom. Dough should be about <span class="super">3</span>/<span class="sub">16</span>-inch (8-mm) thick. Make the edges even by cutting off any excess dough with a knife.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/145-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent">To prevent the dough from rising, prick with a fork. Let rest 15 minutes. Bake at 395°F (200°C) in the middle of the oven for 10–12 minutes. It is ready when it begins to leave the edge and has a light, golden color. Air circulation makes the pie crust crisp. Cool on a rack. If the finished pie will <a id="page_146"/>stand more than 2 hours before eaten, “seal” the bottom with currant or apricot glaze. If you want to keep it longer, brush with melted chocolate. (The glaze recipe makes enough to seal the crust and to brush on the berries.) Before the berries are added, cover the bottom of the pie shell with vanilla cream.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Vanilla Cream:</p>

  <p class="ing">4 egg yolks</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ¾ cups (4 dl) whole milk, boiling</p>

  <p class="ing">⅔ cup (1 ½ dl) sugar</p>

  <p class="ing">½ cup (50 g.) flour</p>

  <p class="ingl">1 ½ tbsp. vanilla sugar</p>

  <p class="noindent">Beat the egg yolks, sugar, and vanilla sugar until light and fluffy. It should be stiff enough that when it falls back into itself, the drips lay on top. Beat in the flour. While beating, add the boiling milk, drop by drop at first, then in a <span class="italic">thin</span> stream. Pour the mixture into a heavy-bottomed pan and place over medium heat. Stir vigorously while it is being brought to a boil. Lower heat and simmer 2–3 minutes after boiling has begun. Remove from heat and cool.</p>

  <p class="indent">Add berries of your choice (see photo opposite for suggestions). Quickly rinse berries and remove all foreign objects. Drain well on a paper towel while you prepare the glaze.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Glaze:</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tbsp. sugar</p>

  <p class="ingl">¼ cup (1 dl) scant currant jelly or apricot marmalade</p>

  <p class="noindent">Stir the sugar and jelly or marmalade together in a saucepan. Place over medium heat and warm 2–3 minutes. Glaze should thicken to the point that drippings from a spoon are viscous. Do not simmer too long; it may turn to caramel. Brush the glaze over the pie crust to prevent it from becoming soggy.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Spread the vanilla cream in the bottom of the pie crust. Place berries close together, forming a decorative pattern. Brush a thin layer of glaze over the berries. Serve as is with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.</p>

  <p class="noindent1">Serves 10–12</p>
