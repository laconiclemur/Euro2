It comes in many forms and colours; it may be stuffed or plain, dried or fresh, the latter being be found in refrigerated compartments in shops. Pasta is easy to store (especially dried pasta which keeps for a very long time) and also to prepare. There are two kinds of pasta: pasta made from flour, water, salt and egg, and pasta made from semolina, flour, water and salt, but without egg.</span></p><br class="calibre1"/><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> Those who prefer can also make the pasta themselves (for instance, spätzle). The pasta dough can be coloured according to taste, for instance with tomato purée, puréed spinach, very finely chopped herbs, saffron or beetroot juice.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Cooking pasta</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Pasta should always be cooked in plenty of water so that it has enough space to expand and does not stick together. You need 1 litre water per 100 g pasta (2 pints or 5 cups per 4 oz). If the quantity exceeds 400–500 g/14–18 oz it should be cooked in 2 saucepans. Add 1 teaspoon salt for each litre/ 2 pints (5 cups) of water. The salt and pasta should only be added to the water when it is boiling. Cook the pasta uncovered over medium heat following the instructions on the packet (home-made pasta only needs a few minutes) until al dente, stirring occasionally. Strain the cooked pasta in a colander, rinse under hot water (or cold water for pasta salad) and drain.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Potatoes</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Potatoes contain important vitamins, minerals, nutrients and fibre. They have excellent physiologically nutritional properties that are best preserved when prepared without fat and care is taken not to destroy the nutrients they contain. Different potato varieties have different properties. This is why the choice of potato is very important. Based on their cooking properties potatoes are classed as follows:</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Varieties with waxy, firm flesh. These varieties are particularly suitable for salads, boiling and fried potatoes.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Varieties with fairly firm flesh. These are very suitable for boiling, as jacket potatoes, for frying and baking (en papillote) or as a roast vegetable.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Floury varieties. These are ideal for making dumplings, potato fritters, pancakes, potato cakes, or for use in soups and stews.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Storing</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Potatoes should be stored in a dark, well ventilated, cool space (4–6 °C/39–43 °F). If there is any light and the temperature is too high the potatoes will begin to germinate and sometimes turn green in places. Potatoes may be covered with paper. If you do not have good storage facilities it is best to buy smaller amounts which will only be stored for a short time.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Tips</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • For jacket potatoes, always choose potatoes of the same size so that they will take the same time to cook (prick with a fork or knife to check whether the potatoes are cooked).</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • For boiled potatoes, cut the potatoes in pieces of roughly the same size so that they will take the same time to cook.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Only peel the potatoes just before you are going to prepare them. Put them in cold water so that they do not discolour.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Early potatoes (the earliest can be harvested at the beginning of June) have such a thin skin that they do not need peeling. In this case, wash and brush the potatoes very carefully to remove all soil. Early potatoes contain very little starch so they are not suitable for many dishes such as dumplings, potato dough or roast vegetables.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • To boil potatoes, barely cover them in water or cook with very little water, in a potato steamer.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • After pouring away the cooking liquid, return the potatoes to the pan and leave uncovered to let the steam evaporates, while shaking the pan slightly. You can also put a tea towel or kitchen paper between the saucepan and the lid to absorb the steam.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Dumplings</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Dumplings are made from various basic doughs. These are usually made from raw or cooked potatoes or bread rolls, but yeast dough, semolina and spelt are also used. Depending on the recipe, different flavours can be added to the dough, which is normally savoury but may also be sweet. People who prefer to spare themselves the trouble of making dumplings themselves can also buy them readymade.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Tips</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Mix the ingredients very thoroughly so that they form a homogenous mass.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Cut out the dumplings with a spoon and shape them with your hands, previously moistened or lightly coated in flour.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • To fill dumplings, first shape into a ball, then make a hole large enough to be filled with the stuffing. Then carefully press the dough back over the stuffing and smooth out the surface.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Oblong dumplings are made with two spoons, previously moistened. Press the mass from one spoon onto the other until an oblong dumpling is formed.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • When they have been made, put the dumplings on a plate moistened with water or lightly coated with flour to prevent sticking.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Dumplings need a lot of room to cook, so a large pan is needed.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Test one dumpling to check whether the dough is the right consistency. If the dumpling disintegrates, add a little more semolina, potato or flour. But if the dumpling is too firm, add a little more stock, milk, curd cheese or egg to the dough.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Put the dumplings in boiling water, lower the heat and cook the dumplings with the lid on, except for yeast-based dumplings. Do not boil: the water should only be “moving” very gently.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Shake the pan lightly now and again to make the dumplings rise to the surface.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Towards the end of the cooking time, take one dumpling out of the water and open using two forks. If the inside is dry, the dumplings are ready. If the inside is moist, the dumplings must cook a little longer.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • When the dumplings are done, remove from the water with a skimming ladle and leave to drain thoroughly.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Rice</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Rice is rich in vitamins and minerals, low in calories and very easy to digest.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Basmati rice</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> An aromatic variety of rice which develops a delicate fragrance when cooked.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Brown rice</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> The brownish grains still have the soft, silvery inner membrane and the seedling that contains important vitamins and minerals.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Because this variety goes rancid rather quickly it also should be used soon after purchase and not stored for too long. It takes longer to cook than polished rice varieties. Polished rice is produced when the silvery membrane of the brown rice is removed. This involves the grains being cleaned, polished and glazed. Polished rice contains fewer vitamins than brown rice. The fatty elements are removed and it can be stored for longer.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Easy-cook rice</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> This type of rice is pre-cooked after polishing, so it only needs to be cooked for 3–5 minutes.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Long grain rice (Patna rice)</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> This is a widely used variety of rice. The grains are long and narrow and appear slightly transparent when uncooked. This variety is ideally suited for spicy ricebased dishes.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Parboiled rice </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> In the case of parboiled rice, the vitamins and minerals are transferred from the silvery membrane to the inner core of the grain. This means that the rice retains its vitamins and minerals when it is cleaned and polished. Parboiled rice is slightly yellowish before cooking and turns white when cooked. The grains remain separate even when the rice is cooked again.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Risotto rice </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> This has a medium-sized grain (i.e. between short grain and long grain) and originates from Italy. It produces a lot of starch during the cooking process which gives risotto its creamy consistency.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Short grain rice</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> This variety has short grains as the name suggests. It produces a lot of starch when it swells up, while also becoming very soft and mushy. This variety is almost exclusively used for making rice puddings.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Wild rice </span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Strictly speaking, wild rice is not rice but the seed of a variety of aquatic grasses. The grains are thin, almost black and have a nutty flavour. It is very expensive and is usually only available mixed with longgrain rice.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Preparation</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Rice trebles in volume during the cooking process. This means that 1 cup of raw rice produces 3 cups of cooked rice. The cooking time depends on the type of rice. Unhusked rice needs to be cooked for 35–40 minutes, while husked rice only needs from 15–20 minutes (follow the instructions on the packet). You can cook rice either in plenty of boiling salted water, or first fry it in a little oil and then cook in less liquid to enable it to swell (ratio of rice to liquid = 1 to 2). Many vitamins and minerals are lost when the cooking liquid is poured away. But when rice swells up it absorbs all the liquid so that it retains all the nutrients.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Tip</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Cooked rice will not stick together if you place a tea towel between the saucepan and the lid. The steam produced by the rice will then be absorbed by the towel, thus preventing condensation. A further advantage is that the rice does not continue to cook.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Arrange the cooked rice in a soup tureen, greased mould or cup, press down lightly and turn over on a preheated dish.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • To heat up large quantities of rice, put in a greased, heat-resistant dish, cover and heat in the oven preheated to 150 °C/300 °F (Gas mark 2).</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Leftover rice will keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 days but it should be covered. It is even better to freeze leftover rice, then defrost it in a sieve over hot steam before reheating it.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Rice which will be added to soup should be slightly undercooked and only added to the soup just before serving because it continues to cook in the hot liquid.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Cereal</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">The term cereal refers to cereal grains such as rice, rye, wheat, barley, oats, millet, buckwheat and maize. Cereals also include pearl barley, starch, sago and custard powder. Cereals are very important in the diet because they contain important vitamins, minerals, trace elements and fibre. Cereals come in a variety of forms including whole grain, crushed flakes and finely or coarsely ground.</span></p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_142"></div>
