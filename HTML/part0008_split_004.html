			<p class="rec-intro">One of the many great things about this recipe is that nearly all the work can be done well in advance, leaving just the final glaze and assembly when you’re ready to eat. The traditional baba is served with rum and I remember as an apprentice not being allowed to make these delicious cakes for fear that I would get inebriated. This version uses Calvados, another potent spirit, and just as good. If serving kids, leave the Calvados out of the syrup and let the adults help themselves. You can make babas in any shape, such as rings, but I like to use little moulds of about 4 x 3cm.</p>

			<p class="body">Dissolve the yeast in the milk in a food mixer bowl. Add the flour, honey, salt and eggs and knead with the dough hook attachment for 5 minutes. Scrape down the edges, add the butter and continue to work the dough until the butter has been incorporated. Cover and leave to rise for 45 minutes. </p>
			<p class="body">Preheat the oven to 200°C/Fan 180°C/Gas 6. Butter your moulds, unless they are non-stick silicone ones. Knock back the dough, then half fill the baba moulds with it. Leave them to rise again for 30 minutes, then bake in the preheated oven until golden and fully cooked – this should take about 20 minutes. Take the babas out of the moulds and leave to cool on a rack</p>
			<p class="body">To make the compote, peel and roughly chop the apples. Put them in a pan with the sugar and a splash of water, then bring to a simmer. Mash the apples as they cook until you have a soft compote. Leave to cool until needed.</p>
			<p class="body">To make the syrup, put the lemon grass in a small pan with the apple juice, lime juice and sugar. Bring to the boil and then pass through a fine sieve. Add Calvados to taste. Dunk the babas in the lukewarm syrup until swollen, plump and completely soaked. The syrup shouldn’t be too hot or the babas may crack, but if it is too cold, the babas will not soak as well. Place them on a wire rack to drain, then refrigerate until needed. </p>
			<p class="body">Just before serving, make the glaze. Pour the apple juice into a pan, add the sugar and boil until the sugar has melted. Mix the cornflour and lemon juice, then whisk this into the boiling apple juice to thicken. Brush the babas with the glaze to give them a lovely sheen, then serve on a bed of apple compote. Top with Chantilly cream and apple crisps if you like. </p>
