  <p class="chap-para">Scottiglia is a slow-cooked Tuscan stew or casserole that is usually made with whatever the hunter has managed to catch, so you could substitute wild boar, rabbit or hare for the venison in this recipe. Many supermarkets now sell farmed venison; ‘casserole venison’ is cut up ready for stewing. The meat is first marinated overnight for maximum tenderness and flavour and then slow-cooked for a rich-tasting casserole. Delicious served with runny polenta (cornmeal).</p>
