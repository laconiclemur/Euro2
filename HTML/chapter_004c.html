<h2 class="h2b">SAUTE DE CHAMPIGNONS SAUVAGES</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Sautéed Wild Mushrooms</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>As simple and short as it is, a recipe is definitely merited. The heating of the oil until it is smoking and the addition of the butter that cooks to a foamy nuttiness are so, so vital. To my mind and taste, the ideal mushrooms for this are either</em> sanguines <em>(saffron milk caps) or ceps, but failing either of these you could use large cap mushrooms which tend to have a fairly gutsy, if not wild, flavour. I like to use flat-leaf parsley as opposed to the more common curly. Rather than chop it madly, leaving you with a green board and a bunch of wet stuff that smells like freshly mown grass, I slice it finely, which you can either do with a sharp knife or a pair of scissors</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
Around 600g (1lb 5oz) wild mushrooms<br/>
3 tbsp olive oil<br/>
50g (1¾ oz) unsalted butter<br/>
3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped<br/>
1 small bunch flat-leaf parsley, leaves picked from the stalks, sliced<br/>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 180°C/350°F/Gas 4.</p>
<p class="normala">Heat a large heavy frying pan with the olive oil until it is smoking, then add the mushrooms in a single layer and just leave them for a couple of minutes to let the heat get back into the pan. Toss them a little, then fry them for a further few minutes until they are well coloured. Next add the butter and let this cook until it is golden brown and has a healthy smell of nuts. Sprinkle over the garlic and parsley and as soon as you are hit by their aroma, season the mushrooms and serve and eat them immediately, as a starter or accompaniment.</p>
