<p class="chapterSubtitle">{ <span class="bi-color">tortilla de patatas</span> }</p>
</div>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">This is also known as</span> tortilla española <span class="italic">because you find it everywhere, in every region, in tapas bars and in homes. Some like it with potatoes only, some add onions. Some like it moist, others prefer it firm and dry. Some slice the potatoes, some cut them into small dice. I like it with onions and slightly creamy. I will not pretend that it is easy to make. On the contrary, making</span> tortilla española <span class="italic">is an art that has secrets and tricks and requires skill and intuition. In trying to make a large one, I failed twice, partly because I did not have the strength to turn a tortilla from a heavy skillet onto a large platter without most of the uncooked part spilling out. Finally I called my friend Alicia in despair. She sent me five pages of “secrets” for getting it right.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">For years, I had been making an Arab-style potato omelet, by boiling the potatoes, then slicing them, and finishing the omelet under the broiler. Alicia said, “No! No! No!” to that. She advised me to make two small omelets rather than one large one. She said to use a very light nonstick skillet and a slightly concave pan lid larger than the skillet to catch any liquid running out from the overturned omelet before returning it to the skillet. The shape of the lid is important. I have been told by people that a lid for making</span> tortilla <span class="italic">is something you hand down in the family.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Through Alicia, I met a young chef who taught at a cooking school; he said that they used sunflower oil because it is cheaper than olive oil. Alicia kept silent, but when we were alone, she said, “No! Anyway, with olive oil you can use it again and again, so it actually works out to be cheaper than other oils.”</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4</span></p>
<p class="qun">½ pound new or waxy potatoes, peeled, cut into ½-inch dice, and patted dry</p>
<p class="qun">1¼ cups olive oil, or enough to cover the potatoes</p>
<p class="qun">1 medium onion, cut in half and thinly sliced</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun1">6 large eggs</p>
<p class="recsum">Dry the potatoes on a dish towel or paper towels as soon as you have sliced them. Heat the oil in a nonstick skillet just large enough to contain all the ingredients (I use one with a base 6½ inches in diameter) over medium heat. Add the potatoes and onion, and cook, covered, over low heat (in this way they are stewed rather than fried) for 20 to 30 minutes, until the potatoes are tender when you prick them with the point of a knife. Move them occasionally with a fork and do not let them color. Drain them in a colander, reserving the oil. Spread on paper towels and sprinkle lightly with salt.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Beat the eggs lightly with a fork in a bowl, adding a little salt. Add the potatoes and onions, and mix gently.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Pour 1 tablespoon of the reserved oil back into the skillet and heat until it almost begins to smoke. Pour in the egg and potato mixture, turn down the heat to low, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until the eggs set at the bottom; shake the pan occasionally with a gentle circular movement so that the omelet doesn’t stick.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Place a slightly concave lid larger than the pan on top of the pan and flip the pan over quickly, inverting the omelet onto the lid. Heat another tablespoon of the oil in the skillet (you can keep the remaining oil to make another omelet) over high heat, then slide the omelet gently into the pan, uncooked side down, lower the heat, and cook for 2 minutes more or until just set.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Run a wooden spoon around the edges of the omelet to give it a tidy look and turn out. Serve warm or at room temperature.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATIONS</span></p>
<p class="bl-first">• I have put the tortilla under the broiler to finish it instead of turning it over, and I recommend it to those who find it difficult to turn the tortilla over.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• In Navarre, there is a <span class="italic">tortilla al horno,</span> cooked in the oven. Boiled potatoes cut into little squares are mixed with chopped flat-leaf parsley and beaten eggs and seasoned with salt and pepper, poured into a greased dish, and baked at 325°F for 45 to 60 minutes.</p>
<p class="bl-last">• For a <span class="italic">tortilla de cebolla,</span> with onions alone, fry 2 large onions halved and thinly sliced in 3 tablespoons oil until golden. Mix them in a bowl with 8 lightly beaten eggs, season with salt and pepper, and proceed as above.</p>
