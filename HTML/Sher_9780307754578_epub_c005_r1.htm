  <p class="center1"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L01_r1.jpg" /></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Eggs are extremely popular in Germany, not only as garnishes and enrichments for other foods, but for themselves. Although soft-cooked eggs in pretty porcelain cups are the only kind that appear at breakfast, from then on and for the rest of the day, the preparations become far more imaginative and varied. For second breakfasts, afternoon snacks, late cold suppers and as appetizers, Germans like stuffed hard-cooked eggs; and in the Black Forest, there is an almost endless array of egg salads.</p>

  <p class="indent">For luncheon or dinner entrees, eggs are combined with cheese, meats, fish or vegetables to turn them into hearty main courses. As one might expect, the basic egg preparations are the same in Germany as anywhere else. Differences lie in the foods and flavorings combined with these basic egg preparations to make them interesting and different.</p>

  <p class="indent">Raw egg yolks (rohe Eigelb) are regarded as the most efficacious morning-after cures for a Katzenjammer—the German hangover that is remarkably like our own. To make the yolks more palatable and to give them extra restorative powers, they may be whipped up with a little red wine. An egg yolk is sometimes blended with a tablespoonful of honey, then stirred into a cup of warm milk and spiked with a tablespoonful or two of brandy—a kind of warm eggnog that is a complete and exhilarating breakfast.</p>

  <p class="indent">Both hard-cooked eggs (hartgekochte Eier) and poached eggs, called “lost” (or verlorene Eier), are served topped with cheese, mushroom or tomato sauce. One of the sauces may be spooned over them, or they may be baked in the sauce for a few minutes before serving.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page88"></a>Fried eggs, known as “mirror” or Spiegeleier, are favorites on German menus. Usually three are served as the standard portion and the eggs may be accompanied by fried ham or bacon, or they may be topped with a sprinkling of grated Swiss cheese that has cooked with them, or dressed with a layer of onion rings sautéed separately in butter until soft and golden.</p>

  <p class="indent">Scrambled eggs (Rühreier), literally, “stirred” eggs, are flavored with minced fresh herbs such as chives or parsley, cheese, caraway seeds, flecks of fried bacon or cooked ham, slices of sausages or finely diced cooked vegetables. They are often served on top of slices of cold ham or tongue and are popular garnishes for such dishes as smoked eel, smoked kippers and creamed mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="indent">French-style omelettes are as important in Germany as they are everywhere else, and they are preferred with the same foods and flavorings as described above for scrambled eggs. But German egg cookery reaches its real genius with other types of egg pancakes—called Eierkuchen or Pfannkuchen, egg cakes or pancakes. The soufflé omelette (Schaumomelett) is a favorite, and for this the stiffly beaten egg white is added to the egg yolk and flavorings, and then cooked on top of the stove, in the oven, or a combination of both. Flour is sometimes added to the French or soufflé omelettes to make them more like spongy cakes, and the German love for crepes and large, sweet, thin pancakes, with or without apples, is too well known to need elaborating here.</p>

  <p class="indent">Soufflés (Aufläufe) are common delights on German tables, and again, the most popular versions are the same as one finds throughout Europe : cheese and ham soufflés as main courses; chocolate, chestnut, lemon and Grand Marnier soufflés for dessert. As with the rest of the egg recipes in this chapter, I have included only those combinations that seem especially German.</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_3"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>CHEESE (Käse)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">Germany produces a number of fine cheeses, some of which are exported to this country. But if the German varieties are not available where you live, you will certainly be able to get all the general types, either made in the United States or imported from other countries. There is an Emmenthaler, close to a Swiss Gruyère, a fragrant semi-soft Tilsiter, a fine buttery Münster, and several hard, tangy beer cheeses. Green-herbed Sago and Italian Parmesan are often grated into German dishes to make them more savory. When it comes to ripening cheeses, Germans prefer those that are strong-tasting and very strong-smelling. Allgäuer, Limburger and the French-sounding, strictly German Romadour are among these along with hand cheese (Handkäse) that may well be the world’s worst-smelling cheese. A cheese platter is a favorite dessert after <a id="page89"></a>a cold meal (never after a hot one), and sliced cheeses are often served as complete light meals in themselves for breakfast, lunch, mid-afternoon or late at night. Gervais and Camembert are on all restaurant menus for dessert, prepared as described.</p>

  <p class="indent">The most popular cheese for cooking is pot cheese (Topfen) or its creamed derivative, cottage cheese (Quark). These can be used interchangeably in most recipes, as long as you allow for the difference in moisture between them when adding other liquids. Since cottage cheese is a little easier to get in this country, I have indicated it where possible in the recipes that follow. If you <em>can</em> get pot cheese, use it and add a little more of whatever liquid is called for in the recipe. Weisskäse or Kümmelkäse is cottage or pot cheese with caraway seeds added, and in the Harz mountains this is allowed to ripen in crocks until it becomes highly fragrant, to put it mildly. In Saxony, pot cheese is mixed with minced chives and onions or scallions, and is then stirred into thick sour cream to make a dressing for boiled potatoes that are served hot, with or without jackets.</p>

  <p class="indent">There are also dozens of processed cheeses imported from Germany, many of them blended with wines, brandies, herbs, smoked ham and many other such flavorings. German processed cheeses are not any better than other processed cheese, but this may be a personal blind spot, so perhaps you should try them for yourself.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Nowhere in the world can you get better ham and eggs than in Germany, and for some reason or other this dish always seems at its best in Hamburg. It is an impression that has been corroborated on five separate visits to that city, each several years apart. Ham and eggs are always fried together, pancake style, in Germany, and to do this successfully, you must let the eggs fry slowly, or they will not cook thoroughly.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">1 SERVING</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 or 3 slices precooked ham, about ¼″ thick</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 eggs (the standard portion in Germany)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a 9” skillet and slowly fry ham slices, turning so both sides are slightly browned. Add other tablespoonful of butter and when hot and bubbling, break eggs over ham slices. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper and fry slowly so that eggs will be thoroughly cooked, basting several times with the hot butter.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">1 SERVING</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 slice white bread without crust, diced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 teaspoons finely minced onion</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 eggs, lightly beaten with 1 tablespoon milk</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Heat butter in an 8” skillet and slowly fry diced bread and onion until golden. Season eggs with a few dashes of salt and pepper and pour into skillet over bread and onion. Scramble egg mixture over low heat until egg is cooked as you like it.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">2 TO 4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 eggs</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 cups water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons vinegar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 scant tablespoon flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon prepared mustard</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon sour cream</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>nutmeg</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 slices toast</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>minced chives</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Poach eggs in water to which vinegar has been added. When eggs are done, remove with a slotted spoon and place on warm plate. Reserve cooking water. Melt butter in small saucepan and when hot and bubbling, blend in flour and mustard. Gradually add 1 cup water in which eggs were poached, stirring constantly over low heat. Blend in sour cream, and season to taste with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Cook until sauce is smooth and thickened. Place a poached egg on each slice of toast and cover with mustard sauce. Sprinkle with chives and serve. Serve 2 eggs to a portion for an entree; 1 egg to a portion as an appetizer.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">1 SERVING</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 slices cooked ham cut to fit poaching cups</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 teaspoon butter (approximately)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 eggs</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 slices toast, or</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 English muffin, split and toasted</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 or 5 asparagus tips, cooked</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 or 5 tablespoons Hollandaise, White or Cheese Sauce</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">The thinly sliced ham should be trimmed to fit round cups of egg poacher. Place cups in frame and bring water to boiling point. Add about ½ teaspoon butter to each egg cup, cover pan and simmer until butter melts. Line each cup with slice of ham and gently break egg over ham. Cover and poach eggs as you usually would—ideally, until whites are set and yolks still runny. Butter toast or muffin halves. Invert egg cup over each slice and let egg and ham drop onto toast, ham side up. Arrange asparagus tips around toast and spoon sauce over all.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">3 TO 4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¼ cup diced bacon (use unsliced bacon for this)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 small onion, finely diced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 medium-sized potatoes, boiled, peeled and cut into small cubes</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon minced parsley</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>5 eggs, lightly beaten with 2 tablespoons milk</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Put bacon in a cold 9” or 10” skillet and fry slowly. When lightly browned on all sides, add onion and continue frying slowly until onion begins to soften and take on color. Add potatoes and sprinkle lightly with salt, pepper and parsley. Sauté slowly, stirring carefully with a wooden spoon or spatula so potatoes do not break apart. When potatoes begin to turn golden brown, pour egg-milk mixture into skillet. Cook over high heat and with fork move cooked edges of omelette away from sides and toward center of pan, tilting pan so that uncooked egg will run to bottom. Continue in this way until egg is completely set. This omelette may be turned over and lightly browned on the top side, or it <a id="page92"></a>may be folded in half and served in the manner of a French omelette, or eggs can be added to sautéed bacon-onion-potato mixture and the whole thing then baked in oven. If you prefer, this mixture can be lightly scrambled instead of being cooked as an omelette.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 eggs lightly beaten with a dash of salt and 2 tablespoons of milk</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 large tomato, thinly sliced</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Heat butter in a 9” or 10” skillet and in it fry bacon until it begins to turn brown. Add Bratwurst or link sausage slices and fry slowly until browned on both sides. Sprinkle with half the parsley, sauté a minute or two, then pour egg mixture into skillet. Cook over high heat, and with a fork move cooked edges of omelette away from sides and toward center of pan, tilting pan so that uncooked egg will run over to bottom. When egg is set, slide omelette onto a heated platter or divide it in half and serve on heated individual serving plates. Top with tomato slices, a light sprinkling of salt and rest of parsley.</p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>grated rind of 1 lemon</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 egg whites</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>fruit sauce or preserves</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page93"></a>Beat egg yolks with sugar, a dash of salt and grated lemon rind. Beat egg whites to a stiff snow and fold into yolk mixture. Heat butter in a <strong>9”</strong> skillet and when it begins to bubble, add egg mixture. Cook slowly until bottom of omelette is golden brown. You may cover pan until top of omelette is thoroughly cooked, or you may serve it with top slightly runny, as with a regular French omelette. You may also turn it over if you like it browned on both sides. Spread with fruit sauce or preserves. Apricot, strawberry or raspberry preserves are especially good with this. Fold in half and serve.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. To make a Cheese Soufflé Omelette, add 2 tablespoons grated Cheddar, Parmesan or Gruyère cheese to egg-yolk mixture and eliminate lemon rind and sugar. A dash of cayenne may be added for seasoning.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. Finely minced parsley and/or chives may be added to egg-yolk mixture, in which case you would also eliminate sugar and lemon rind and add an extra dash of salt.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. To make a Chocolate Soufflé Omelette, stir 2 ounces cooled melted bittersweet chocolate that has been mixed with two tablespoons water into egg-yolk mixture. Eliminate lemon rind and salt and adjust amount of sugar to taste. Finish this omelette either by covering it or by putting it in 400° oven. Do not turn it over. Serve sprinkled with granulated sugar, with whipped cream or Chocolate Sauce.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">This dish is a wonderful hot appetizer or an entree for a light luncheon or dinner. It is also perfect for a company brunch or midnight supper. It is a convenient “meal in one baking dish” and needs only a crisp salad and some coffee, beer or white wine to make it complete.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">3 TO 6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>Butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>6 slices white bread</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>12 slices bacon, crisply fried and drained, or 12 slices Canadian bacon, fried and drained</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>6 slices Swiss cheese, cut to cover bread slices</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>6 tablespoons sweet cream</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>minced chives</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Heat oven to 375°. Butter a rectangular baking dish well, then cover bottom with bread slices, arranged side by side in single layer. Place 2 strips bacon, or 2 slices Canadian bacon, on each piece and cover with cheese slice. Break eggs over slices. Pour a little cream around yolk of each egg, sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper and bake until eggs are set, 10 to 20 minutes. Sprinkle with chives and serve. You may also prepare and serve these eggs in individual open bakers, such as shirred-egg dishes.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">6 TO 8 PANCAKES</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 cup sour cream or cottage cheese</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ teaspoon salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 to 6 tablespoons milk</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 egg yolks</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¾ cup flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 egg whites</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 to 2 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Sprinkle sour cream or cottage cheese with salt and gradually stir in milk until mixture is consistency of heavy sweet cream. If you are using sour cream, 2 to 4 tablespoonfuls milk will be enough; cottage cheese may require 4 to 6. Beat in egg yolks and add flour, a little at a time, stirring until batter is smooth between each addition. Beat egg whites to a stiff snow and fold into cream and egg yolk mixture. Melt 1 tablespoon <a id="page95"></a>butter in 10” skillet. For each pancake, drop about ½ cup batter into hot butter. Space pancakes 3 to 4 inches apart. Fry slowly until underside is golden brown and pancake begins to puff up. Turn and brown other side. Add more butter to skillet and fry remaining batter. If you have a very large skillet, melt all the butter at once and fry 6 to 8 pancakes in a single shift. These pancakes may be served as a light luncheon entree. They can be garnished with a dab of sour cream and accompanied by a crisp green salad. They are also good sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar and served as dinner dessert or with afternoon coffee.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. Add 1 tablespoonful sugar and grated rind of ½ lemon to batter. Sprinkle finished pancakes with sugar and serve with fresh or preserved fruit sauce.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. For Apple Sour Cream Pancakes, peel 1 large or 2 small apples, cut into small cubes and sauté in hot butter 3 or 4 minutes, or until apples begin to take on color. Add apple cubes to egg-yolk-cream mixture before folding in egg whites. Fry as directed in master recipe and serve sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. Yogurt may be substituted for sour cream. Less milk will be needed in that case; 1 or 2 tablespoonfuls will do.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Literally translated, Arme Ritter means Poor Knights; it is the dish we know better as French toast, although the German version differs from our own in that it is lightly coated with breadcrumbs before being fried. For best results, buy the very best white bread you can get, unsliced, and cut it thickly by hand. In Germany, crusty white rolls are often used for this, and you will also get excellent results with the golden, braided loaf bread you can find in Central European and Jewish bakeries. Poor Knights are often served with apple slices that have been pared and lightly browned in butter.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">4 TO 8 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 egg yolks</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 cups milk</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon sugar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>grated rind 1 lemon</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>8 to 10 1”-thick slices stale white bread, with crusts, or 6 to 8 stale rolls, cut into 1”-thick slices</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 egg whites lightly beaten with 2 tablespoons water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>breadcrumbs</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 to 4 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>Cinnamon</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>sugar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>sautéed apple slices (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Beat egg yolks with milk, sugar, a dash of salt and lemon rind. Soak bread slices in egg-milk mixture until all liquid is absorbed. Turn slices once during soaking so bread will be evenly saturated. Carefully dip each bread slice into egg-white and water mixture and then into breadcrumbs, coating slices on both sides. Heat butter in a large skillet and slowly fry bread slices, browning first on one side and then the other. Sprinkle with cinnamon and granulated sugar just before serving. Top with sautéed apple slices if you are using them. If your skillet is too small to allow you to cook all bread slices at once, fry them in two shifts. In that case, do not soak all the slices at one time. Soak and coat second batch while first is frying, or bread will become too soggy to handle.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. For Carthusian Dumplings (Karthäuser Klösse) : Use Parker House-type rolls; grate crust off each roll, then cut in half lengthwise. Flavor egg-milk mixture with ½ teaspoon almond extract or 5 grated bitter almonds. After rolls are dipped, dredge with crumbs of grated crust. If you like, slices can be studded with slivered, blanched untoasted sweet almonds. Fry as directed and while still hot, dredge on all sides with half-and-half mixture of cinnamon and sugar.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. For Drunken Maidens or Knights (Versoffene Jungfern oder Ritter) : Using Parker House-type rolls, grate crust off rolls and cut in half <a id="page97"></a>lengthwise. Soak, dredge and fry. While slices fry, heat ½ cups red wine with 1 stick cinnamon and a little sugar to taste. Pour this hot wine over fried bread slices, and serve while hot in deep dishes. To make this even more elaborate, cut bread slices can be spread on one side with a little Preiselbeeren, cranberry or currant preserves, not jelly. Sandwich coated sides together in pairs. Dip each sandwich into egg batter, dredge with breadcrumbs, and fry; soak the finished jam sandwiches with wine.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. Plum or Prune Hot Sandwiches (Pflaumen- oder Zwetschgenbavesen) : Instead of using preserves, plum or prune jam may be substituted. The bread slices are sandwiched together, dipped in egg-milk mixture, dredged and fried. They are served sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">3 TO 4 PANCAKES; 3 TO 4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup sifted flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 teaspoons sugar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¼ teaspoon salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 eggs</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup milk</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>6 tablespoons butter (approximately)</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Sift flour, sugar and salt together. Using a rotary beater, whip eggs until light and frothy; beat in milk. Turn flour mixture into beaten egg and, still using beater, whip until you have a smooth batter. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a 10” skillet, or a 12” skillet if you can handle it, and pour in just enough batter to cover bottom with a thin layer. This should take approximately a fourth to a third of batter. As soon as you pour batter, tilt and rotate pan so batter will run over it evenly. Cook over moderate heat until pancakes are golden brown on underside; turn and brown second side. Remove to heated platter.</p>

  <p class="indent">Continue to fry rest of pancakes in same way until batter is used up. Add 2 tablespoons butter to pan between each pancake. To keep the first pancakes hot while you make the others, arrange them in large open baking dish and place in 250° to 300° oven until you are ready for them. It’s a good idea to keep oven door open so they don’t bake. Put final topping on rolled pancakes when all have been made.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>PANCAKE GARNISHES</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. For a simple dessert or a breakfast entree, sprinkle each crepe with a little cinnamon and sugar. Roll and brush with melted butter.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2 For a more elaborate dessert, add any preserved fruit to crepe before rolling it. Preiselbeeren, the tiny German cranberries, are excellent for this. After rolling pancakes, brush them with a little melted butter and sprinkle with a little more cinnamon and sugar. Pour a little heated rum, brandy, or any white fruit liqueur, such as kirsch, framboise or quetsch, over rolled pancakes and flambé them.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. For Apple Pancake (Apfelpfannkuchen), sauté pared apple slices in a little butter until they soften slightly and begin to take on color. Sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar. Prepare pancake batter, and when it has set in pan, add a layer of apples and cover with a thin coating of additional batter. Brown slowly on both sides. Fold in half or roll, brush with melted butter and sprinkle with a little more cinnamon and sugar. Use 3 medium-sized apples for this amount of batter.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">4. For Cherry Pancake (Kirschpfannkuchen), substitute 1 pound cherries—washed, dried, stoned and cut in half—for apple slices.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">16 TO 20 PANCAKES; 8 TO 10 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 cup sifted flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¼ cup sugar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¼ teaspoon salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 eggs</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup milk</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup heavy cream</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons butter, melted</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup raisins, soaked for 30 minutes in a little rum</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 teaspoon cinnamon</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 cup sugar</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Sift flour, sugar and salt together. Using rotary beater, whip eggs until light and frothy; beat in milk and cream and melted butter. Turn flour mixture into beaten egg and still using rotary beater, whip until you have smooth batter. Grease a 6” or 8” skillet with a little butter and when moderately hot, pour in just enough batter to cover bottom of skillet with a paper-thin layer. To do this, pour batter, then quickly tilt and rotate pan so batter runs over it evenly. Cook over moderate heat until pancake is golden brown on underside; turn and brown second side. Remove to a heated platter. Continue frying pancakes this way until batter has been used. With two forks, tear pancakes into small pieces, approximately 1” to <em>1½″</em> squares or rectangles will do. Melt ½ cup butter in a 10” skillet and add soaked, well-drained raisins and cinnamon. Put cut pancakes into this sauce and sprinkle with 1 cup sugar. Toss lightly over low heat so that it becomes evenly distributed. Do this quickly, as sugar should not melt but retain some of its grainy texture. Serve immediately.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. If you like more flavor in the pancakes themselves, add a little grated lemon rind, or a few drops of rum or vanilla extract to batter. Make this addition to egg-milk mixture before stirring in flour.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. Add ⅓ cup chopped pecans or blanched, toasted almonds to raisin-sugar-cinnamon sauce.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. To make Apple or Cherry Schmarren (Apfel- oder Kirschschmarren), add a few thin slices of apples or a few pieces of cut, stoned cherries to batter after it has been poured into pan. Pour another very thin layer of batter over fruit. Brown on both sides, as directed, cut in strips or pieces and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar before serving.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Use the same batter as for Emperor’s Pancakes, above. In Germany, crepes such as these are very popular both as desserts with sweet fillings <a id="page101"></a> (süsse Füllungen), or as entrees or appetizers with salty fillings (salzige Füllungen). In the latter case, sugar is not added to batter. Following are some sweet and salty fillings.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>SWEET FILLINGS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. Crepes Confiture: Spread crepes with orange marmalade that has been slightly melted. Roll and sprinkle with sugar flavored with lemon rind. You can pour a little warm rum or brandy over these and flambé them in the manner of crepes suzette.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. Cottage Cheese Crepes (Topfenpalatschinken) : Mix a filling with ½ pound cottage cheese, 4 tablespoons sugar, 2 tablespoons raisins, 1 egg yolk and ½ cup sour cream. Blend well and spread over each crepe. Roll and place side by side in open baking dish. Brush with melted butter and bake in 375° oven 10 minutes, or until cheese filling melts slightly. Serve with Chocolate Sauce.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. Fruit-Filled Crepes: Spread crepes with applesauce well seasoned with cinnamon and sugar, or with finely diced fresh fruit such as apricots, cherries, peaches or any berries. For best results, steep cut fruit in sugar for an hour or two before adding to crepes. Chopped pineapple and nuts is another very good filling used in this way. Roll crepes and serve, sprinkled with sugar or topped with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. You may also reverse the order: fill crepes with ice cream and top with fruit.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">4. Chocolate-Filled Crepes: Sprinkle pancakes with mixture of grated bittersweet chocolate, chopped pecans, walnuts or toasted almonds and roll. Serve with Chocolate Sauce and whipped cream.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">5. Maraschino-Gervais Crepes: Spread crepes with Gervais cheese mashed with a little maraschino liqueur. Roll and serve.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>SALTY FILLINGS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Be sure to eliminate sugar from batter when using these. Also, fry crepes on one side only.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. Creamed Spinach.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. Creamed Mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. Creamed chicken with or without mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">4. Biberacher-Pfannen-Duennett: To make these filled crepes that are a specialty of the Swabian town of Biberach, prepare and fry crepe batter as in Basic Crepes. Brown crepes on one side only and arrange on warm plate or surface. The filling for these is scallions, cut in ¼″ to ½″ pieces and then steamed for a few minutes in a little butter. Season with salt, spoon onto crepes and top with grated Sago cheese and butter. Roll crepes, heat 4 to 5 minutes in 450° oven, brush with melted butter and serve.</p>
