<div class="chapter_opener_text" id="div22">I had always wanted to use zucchini flowers at my restaurants but could never find the right supplier at the right cost—until I visited a small Amish organic farm close by the Pennsylvania Turnpike eight years ago. There, among the heirloom tomatoes and sweet baby corn, I saw they were growing zucchinis in old tires. I spotted one plant that was in bloom, so I asked the young farmer, Daniel Beiler, if he would sell me the delicate flowers. I said I’d buy as many as he could grow, but he just scratched his long beard. He couldn’t believe anyone ate them. A couple of months later, he called to say he was sending thirty cases of flowers to my restaurant. We created a lot of zucchini flower specials that month! Now Daniel is an expert grower of zucchini flowers, picking them just before they open so they last a little longer en route to the restaurant. He and his large young family have also learned to love eating them at home, coating them in eggs and flour and cooking them in butter. Daniel is proof that old and new traditions can come together in fresh ways that bring out the best in both.</div>
<div class="chapter_opener_text1" id="div23">Daniel is also part of a trend among smaller organic farmers who have introduced a city crowd to new fruits and vegetables. The best showcase for smaller farmers in my city is the market at Dupont Circle. Every Sunday for the last decade, more than two dozen organic producers have converged on a parking lot next to a bank in downtown Washington, D.C. In rain or in sweltering heat, they unload their trucks, set up some shelter, and lay out crates of the latest crops. Some sell the staple foods—corn, tomatoes, potatoes. But many others have brought new ingredients to a conservative town—sweet pea vines, Asian pears, Brandywine tomatoes. In a city where people work hard and shop at supermarkets, the Dupont Circle farmers’ market has helped transform the way Washingtonians think about their fruit and vegetables, connecting city slickers to the fresh produce of the farmland around the nation’s capital. The market is one of many around the country, part of a movement across America where small farmers have turned themselves into direct sellers, just as they did in the days before the big supermarkets. And just as they <a id="page103"/>do in Spain today, where the farmers have gathered at marketplaces in small towns for centuries.</div>
<div class="chapter_opener_text1" id="div24">For me, the farmers’ market has become a Sunday ritual. My daughters’ baby food consisted of purees from those products—peas and carrots with a little chicken; potatoes, onions, and green beans. That led to several fights with my wife because whenever I fed my daughters, I took a little taste for myself. When my wife saw the empty bowl, I always told her the kids had eaten really well. She never believed me.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div26"><span class="italic">Pisto Manchego</span> is a classic dish: a perfect Mediterranean mix of vegetables—zucchini, peppers, eggplant, and tomato—and olive oil. This version is from La Mancha, the region at the heart of Spain. I’ve finished it off with zucchini flowers, which bring a wonderful seasonal freshness to the <span class="italic">pisto</span>.</div>

<div class="IL_item" id="div40">3 sprigs fresh parsley, finely chopped</div>
</div>
<div class="method" id="div41">Cut the tomatoes in half. Place a grater over a large mixing bowl, and rub the open face of the tomatoes into the grater until all the flesh is grated. Discard the skin. Strain the grated tomatoes and set aside.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div42">Heat the olive oil in a medium sauté pan over a medium flame. Split open the garlic cloves by placing them on a chopping board and pressing down hard with the base of your hand or with the flat side of a knife. Add the garlic to the pan and sauté until it begins to brown, about 2 minutes. Add the onions and thyme, and sauté until the onions become translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the peppers and cook for 3 minutes, or until they start to soften. Add the zucchini and cook for another 3 minutes. The oil should be crackling lightly as the vegetables are cooking. Add the eggplant and cook for another 3 minutes.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div43">Add the reserved tomato puree and cook until it turns a deep red color, 5 to 10 minutes.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div44">Peel back the green base of the zucchini flowers and snap off the stems, pulling out the interior of the blossoms. Right at the end of the cooking time, add these blossoms to the <span class="italic">pisto</span> and remove the pan from the heat after just a few seconds. Season with salt to taste, sprinkle the parsley on top, and serve.</div>

<div class="method1" id="div53">Prepare a bowl of ice water and stir in plenty of salt. Then fill a medium sauté pan with water and bring it to a boil.

<div class="method1" id="div55">Fill a small saucepan with water and place it over low heat. Checking with a thermometer, heat the water to 147 degrees. Place the egg in the water, being careful not to break it, and cook for 35 minutes. Remove the egg from the water and set it aside.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div56">Spoon the asparagus puree onto a serving plate. Carefully shell the flat end of the egg (not the more pointed top). Put the partially shelled egg on the puree and lift the rest of the shell from the top. Place the asparagus tops next to the egg. Drizzle with the olive oil, and season with sea salt to taste. Sprinkle with the chive flowers (if using) and the tarragon pieces, and serve.</div>

The water will spit until it evaporates, leaving the onions thoroughly cooked without getting burned. Add the bacon and sausage, and cook gently until the sausage has browned, about 4 minutes.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div108">Stir in the flour and the liqueur, and cook for 30 seconds. Pour in the chicken stock (or water) and raise the heat to medium. Add the mint sprig and bring to a boil. Then lower the heat to a simmer, add the peas and the vines, and cook for 5 minutes, or until tender. Season with salt to taste.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div109">Spoon a little on each plate, sprinkle the mint leaves on top, and serve immediately.</div>

<div class="tip_text" id="div111">If fresh peas aren’t available, you can get a close approximation by using good-quality frozen peas that are sweet and tender.</div>
<div class="tip_text1" id="div112">If you can’t find a good Spanish <span class="italic">butifarra</span> sausage, any good-quality, sweet pork sausage will do. But you can also skip the bacon and pork sausage—it will still be a wonderful dish.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div114">Despite their look, artichokes are not a difficult vegetable to cook. Here they’re paired with ham (almost any vegetable—asparagus or green beans, for instance—marries well with ham, because of its natural saltiness).</div>
<div class="yield" id="div115"><span class="green"><span class="bold">Serves 4</span></span></div>
<div class="ingredients" id="div116">
<div class="IL_item_top" id="div117">4 large or 6 baby artichokes</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div118">1 bunch flat-leaf parsley, with 1 teaspoon chopped parsley reserved</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div119">3 tablespoons Spanish extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div120">1½ cups juice from canned tomatoes</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div121">1 pinch sugar</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div122">1¼ teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div123">2 tablespoons dry white wine</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div124">1 ounce <span class="italic">jamón serrano (Spanish cured ham), diced (about 2 thin slices)</span></div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div125">1 bay leaf</div>
</div>
<div class="method" id="div126">Using a serrated knife, cut off and discard the top half of each artichoke. Using your fingers, remove and discard the first few layers of leaves, until you reach the tender leaves beneath. Use a spoon to remove and discard the white, hairy interior. Use a paring knife to remove and discard the tough outer layer around the base of the artichoke, until you reach the soft white flesh. Peel the stalk until you reach the white flesh again. Don’t be afraid to remove most of the artichoke. Repeat with all the artichokes.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div127">Cut the trimmed artichokes into 6 or 8 segments, and put them in a bowl of cold water. Add the bunch of parsley (to stop the artichoke from oxidizing and coloring).</div>
<div class="method1" id="div128">Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a small pan over a medium flame. Add the tomato juice and sugar. Simmer for 15 minutes, until the juice is a deep red.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div129">Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in a sauté pan over a medium flame. Add the artichokes, making sure they lie flat, and the salt. Sauté, stirring every 30 seconds, until the artichokes are golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the wine and simmer until reduced by half, about 30 seconds. Add the ham and stir for 10 seconds; pour in the reserved tomato juice. Add the bay leaf and cook until the artichokes are tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Add salt to taste. Drizzle with a little more oil, sprinkle with chopped parsley, and serve.</div>

<div class="tip_text" id="div131">One day supermarkets here will sell fresh artichoke hearts that are already cleaned, as in Europe today. Until then, although cleaning an artichoke may seem difficult, it’s worth the trouble. When it comes to keeping the hearts white, use parsley, as I do here, instead of the traditional lemon. Lemon makes the artichokes too acidic; the parsley enhances the white color of the flesh.</div>
