<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">This is the great festive Christmas Eve dish of Madrid that is now popular in other parts of Spain. I ate it in Asturias. I was with the American journalist Jane Kramer and the food writer Pepe Iglesias in a restaurant called La Arcea (another name for the</span> becada, <span class="italic">or woodcock), overlooking the sea in Andrin, the port near Llanes. The fish was sensational. They used a wonderful Galician Albariño, but you can use another fruity dry white wine. And you can use sea bass instead of bream.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 large sea bream or sea bass (about 4½ pounds), gutted and scaled</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">1 onion, cut in half and sliced</p>
<p class="qun">6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">8 to 12 waxy potatoes, peeled</p>
<p class="qun">A good pinch of saffron</p>
<p class="qun">1 cup Albariño or other fruity dry white wine, such as Riesling</p>
<p class="qun">1 lemon, cut into thin slices</p>
<p class="qun">2 garlic cloves, crushed to a paste or through a press</p>
<p class="qun">2 tablespoons fine bread crumbs</p>
<p class="qun1">2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley</p>
<p class="recsum">Rinse the fish and season inside and out with salt. Line a baking dish large enough to hold the fish with foil.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Sauté the onion in 1 tablespoon of the oil in a skillet over medium heat until soft and golden. Spread in the baking dish.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Cook the potatoes in boiling salted water for 10 minutes; drain and cut into thick slices.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Add the potatoes to the onions. Sprinkle on 3 tablespoons of the oil, add the saffron and a little salt, and mix gently, then pour in the wine.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Rub the top of the fish with 1 tablespoon of the oil and place it in the baking dish, with the potatoes around it. Slash it in 2 places at the thickest part. Cut 1 slice of lemon in half and insert one half in each cut. Put 1 lemon slice inside the fish and the rest on top of the potatoes.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Mix the remaining tablespoon of olive oil with the garlic, bread crumbs, and 1 tablespoon of the parsley, and sprinkle this mixture over the fish. Roast the fish in a preheated 475°F oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until cooked (test using the point of a knife in the thickest part—the flesh should be opaque right through to the bone) and the potatoes are tender.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Serve sprinkled with the remaining tablespoon of parsley.</p>
