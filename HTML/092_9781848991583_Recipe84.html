<p class="normal"><b>There are so many types of honey to choose from, so experiment to find the ones you like the best. I find the subtle flavors of flower honeys delicious, and here they perfectly complement the flavor of delicate pink rhubarb.</b></p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">SERVES</span></b> 4</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 20 minutes, plus at least 8 hours freezing</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 10 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">5 egg yolks</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 cup less 1½ tablespoons honey, such as lavender, thyme, chestnut or acacia</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 vanilla bean, split in half lengthwise and seeds scraped out</p>
<p class="acktxt">⅔ cup whipping cream</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 rhubarb sticks, chopped into large pieces</p>
<p class="acktxt">a few edible lavender flowers, to serve</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Line a 12- x 5- x 3½-inch bread pan or terrine with plastic wrap, leaving a generous overhang. Put the egg yolks in a mixing bowl and add the vanilla seeds, reserving the bean for another recipe. Melt 2½ tablespoons of the honey in a small saucepan over low heat, then scrape it into the egg yolks and beat about 10 minutes, using an electric mixer, until the mixture is cool and forms a light ribbon when the beaters are lifted out of the bowl.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Whip the cream, then fold it into the cold egg and honey mixture. Pour the mixture into the prepared bread pan, cover with the overhanging plastic wrap and put in the freezer at least 8 hours until firm.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> To poach the rhubarb, pour 2 cups water and the remaining honey into a saucepan and bring to a boil. Turn the heat down to low and simmer 3 to 4 minutes until a very light syrup forms. Add the rhubarb and poach slowly about 5 minutes until it is just soft. Using a slotted spoon, scoop out the rhubarb and put it on a plate to cool. At the same time, leave the syrup to cool. When both are cool, return the rhubarb to the syrup, then sprinkle with the lavender flowers and serve with a slice of the honey parfait.</p>
