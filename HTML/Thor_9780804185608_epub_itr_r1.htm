<div class="nonindent" id="div5"><span class="dropcaps2line">T</span>here is a ferry that sails south from the town of Royan, on the Atlantic Ocean, to Le Verdon at the northern tip of the Médoc peninsula. It is not a particularly charming ride—nor one I had ever planned on taking. Yet one day in late autumn some years ago, I found myself on that ferry with my husband, three kids, five dogs, and a baby on the way. We had given up our apartment in the lovely 7th arrondissement of Paris, found a house in Médoc, and, voilà, there we were.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div6">How did an only child from bustling Hong Kong, born into a family with a fondness for cats, whose French mother hardly ever set foot in the kitchen, end up on that ferry? I don’t know exactly, but I think my current country lifestyle—complete with a big rowdy family, lots of dogs, and a huge kitchen where I can make all my culinary fantasies come true—is something I always wanted.</div>
<div class="nonindent_space" id="div7">My favorite food memories of my childhood include my father taking me, sometimes late at night, to little food stalls in Hong Kong. We’d seek out the best tripe, the finest dumplings, our favorite comforting bowl of noodles. I was a picky eater, a skinny child, which drove him nuts. But in the end he always found a way to feed my cravings. He probably understood me better than anyone; I definitely inherited my food obsession from him. We didn’t say hello, but, instead, “Have you eaten?” as many Chinese people do.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div8">In contrast, we spent our holidays in Paris or in the south of France with my mother’s family. There I was introduced to a whole other world <a id="page10"/>of tastes and flavors, a new universe of gastronomic delights. My grandmother and aunt were both terrific cooks, and every day meant a feast. We started many mornings with a trip to Monsieur Gourdet, the best greengrocer in Moissac, where my grandmother would spend a whole hour choosing the freshest vegetables, fussing over small details, sniffing, observing. Going to the market was like a trip to the museum—each artichoke was a sculpture to be admired. Then we’d have our little moments in the early evenings, just the two of us, peeling away the artichoke leaves and dipping them in her signature vinaigrette, until we reached the best part, the heart. That’s when she would say, “You have it, <span class="italic">chérie</span>; you’re so thin.” My aunt, on the other hand, could take whatever was available and turn it into the most miraculous dishes: fish soup with ruddy-colored rouille, roasted lamb with garlic and flageolets, and an endless repertoire of soups, including my favorite, her fava bean soup. My grandmother was the food philosopher, my aunt the master technician.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div9">While my childhood was filled with food, rarely was I the one in the kitchen helping make it. Later, as a student in Paris and London, I had my signature dishes, a few delicious little things I was proud of and that reflected my tastes, but I always spent more time in restaurants than in my own kitchen. It wasn’t until I married and started a family that the kitchen won me over. Yet I feel as if I had been preparing for this role all my life; all the places I’ve been, all the meals I’ve had, come together in the pots and pans of my kitchen.</div>
<div class="nonindent_space" id="div10">It was an unplanned process that led us to Médoc in the first place. Even now I would be at a loss to explain exactly why we took the plunge. But we needed a bigger place for a growing family, so why not think outside the box, outside Paris? My husband wanted more dogs, we wanted to see the kids running around in a big garden, we were up for an adventure.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div11">The last few years have been a revelation. For a city girl to move to Médoc, one of the more remote and untouched parts of France, was a bit of a shock. I felt somewhat lost the first few months—no hairdresser downstairs, no bakery on the corner. In their place, I have a view of the forest from my bedroom window and, when I am really lucky, a herd of deer roaming my garden in the early hours, so quietly that the dogs don’t even notice them. Gone are the classic parquet floors of our apartment in Paris, the rosettes and stately flourish, the marble mantlepieces, the black painted French balconies, and our tiny kitchen. Now we have beautiful stone floors, rustic walls with real character, fireplaces in every room (which we use for grilling birds in winter), thousands of roses climbing up the wall and decorating one side of the house, and a giant rosemary bush just outside the kitchen window that perfumes the dogs as they pass it by and then bring its scent into the house.</div>
<div class="fullpageimage" id="div12"><a id="page11"/><img alt="" src="images/Thor_9780804185608_epub_006_r1.jpg"/></div>
<div class="indent" id="div13"><a id="page12"/>Never have I been so aware of the changing of the seasons, the different pleasures that each of them has to offer. I grow my own vegetables and even some fruits. I’ve made peace with the moles that dig up our garden. Gradually we have found our favorite everything—from the best baguette to the most perfect duck legs, from where to buy foie gras, to which wines we like best and from what years. We’ve befriended the winemakers, snail farmers, and hunters who regularly pass by our house (and make our dogs crazy).</div>
<div class="indent" id="div14">I am fascinated by the contrasts of the Médoc region, which boasts pine forests where wild boar roam, endless white beaches along the Atlantic, and some of the most famous vineyards in the world. When I first came here, I was worried that the châteaux had been modernized too much and lost their charm, so I was relieved to find that even if the owners might have brushed up on their techniques, the building façades remain as glorious as ever. Driving up from Bordeaux, through the famous villages of Margaux and Pauillac, is like being in an American movie about France, in the best possible sense. In some ways, Médoc is the anti-Provence, for better and worse—not a souvenir shop in sight, and sometimes, less conveniently, not even a loaf of bread. A peninsula detached from the rest of France, Médoc is unknown to many, even to many French. People have drunk the wine but never seen the châteaux. The locals happily go about their lives, enjoying their isolation from the rest of the world.</div>
<div class="nonindent_space" id="div15">A few months after we moved, my daughter Gaïa was born, and a year after that, I launched <span class="italic">Manger</span>, my food blog. I had been encouraged by friends, houseguests, and family to start one—because of my cooking, because they wanted my recipes, because of the way we live, because my husband is a photographer, because we have so many kids and dogs, because I had the time. So, one night in April, out of the blue, without telling anyone, I wrote my first post. I wasn’t sure the world needed another food blog, but I felt I had something to offer: French home cooking in English, from someone who really knows the country—and from an insider who is also an outsider. Being half-French, half-Chinese, I fit in everywhere and nowhere. I grew up in Hong Kong and that place is now partly gone. I’ve lived in France almost half my life, but I don’t consider myself completely French.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div16"><a id="page13"/>I still marvel in my little finds and discoveries, and I wanted to share them, to tell the world about Médoc, to encourage people to take risks and to follow their dreams, whether that means picking up and moving to an old farmhouse in the French countryside or simply trying a new recipe for dinner.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div17">As I am a mother of five and a stepmom to two, children are also high on my list of priorities. My husband, Oddur, and I are (or try to be) serious about educating them about food—from a health perspective, sure, but also in terms of broadening their minds and their palates. We want them to enjoy food as much as we do, and to behave themselves at the table, whether at home or in a restaurant. I love to take them through the whole process of growing vegetables and then cooking them. I want them to understand where food comes from, and how you can transform ingredients in simple ways. And it’s paying off. Mia, my ten-year-old, frequently gives our visitors lectures on nutrition and how to have a healthier life through what you eat. Louise, my five-year-old prima donna, has the most impeccable table manners (when she wants to) but is perhaps a little too sure of what she does and doesn’t want on her plate. Hudson, who is seven, is the biggest gourmand of them all. I have never seen him say no to any food—he really is the boy who ate everything. Then we have Gaïa, the two-year-old, who pesters her father every night at the aperitif hour for pickles and charcuterie. Thorir, my sixteen-year-old stepson, arrives here for his holidays with a fantasy menu of what to eat, a list of the things he has to have before he leaves. For him, eating is a competitive sport and his greatest fear is not having enough of everything. Gunnhildur, the eldest, is so polite she will eat anything, even if it’s far from her favorite. She’s the kindest critic and will be anyone’s dream dinner party guest.</div>
<div class="nonindent_space" id="div18">Most of my culinary fantasies have come true, because everything they say about the French way of life is true—especially the food part.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div19">Before we left Paris, Oddur and I were lucky enough to work on a special project, a food guide to Paris. We spent eighteen months going to a new restaurant almost every weekday, tasting the food, interviewing the chefs,<a id="page14"/> getting their stories and, most important, some of their secrets. It was fascinating for me, having spent such a great deal of my life in the dining rooms of countless establishments, to find myself on the other side of the wall, in the steamy rooms where the action happens. I listened for hundreds of hours as countless chefs—young and old, famous or just starting out—poured their hearts out and spoke about their philosophy of cooking, their preferences, their purveyors. Ingredients, it turned out, are what almost every good chef in France believes to be the most important thing.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div20">Even as other cities, from Copenhagen to Sydney to Tokyo to San Sebastián, claim to rival or have surpassed the French in the kitchen, France will always have its traditions, opinions, and ingredients. The other day, I was out by the side of the road, picking through the brush, when a truck driver passing by inquired, “Are there any?” He knew I was looking for cèpes without even asking. I showed him the small bounty I had collected in my basket and before I knew it, he had parked his huge truck by the side of the road and jumped out to see if he, too, could find some for himself for dinner.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div21">When we lived in Paris, we had four butchers and five bakers on our little stretch of street, and most of them had lines at certain hours of the day. A trip to a French butcher is not just a simple affair of pointing at the lamb chops and saying, “I want eight of those.” On the contrary, it involves a bit of banter; an exchange of recipes, perhaps; a discussion of meals past and present; and an account of how your last purchases worked out. Our little village manages to support two bakeries, despite the fact that some of our neighbors prefer one in the next town—even though it means an extra fifteen minutes in the car.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div22">People take pride in their food and they take it seriously: you tell them your recipe for <span class="italic">blanquette de veau,</span> they counter with theirs. You start a discussion on the best way to make a foie gras terrine, and you will be told by someone that his family’s recipe is the best—but it’s a secret and he can’t share it. It is not uncommon to hear office workers on their lunch breaks debating the best way to make hot chocolate or whether a certain sauce should have shallots or not. In France, when it comes to food, there is a right way to do everything—but everyone’s right way is not the same. Everyone has an opinion and that is, as Inspector Clouseau might say, why France is France.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div23">Although we are people who like to eat, we are accustomed to waiting for seasonal pleasures: strawberries in May and June, bright red (or yellow) tomatoes in July, mushrooms in the fall. We want what we want when it’s in season. One of my favorite chefs, Alain Passard, says it best: “<span class="italic">Les tomates en Décembre, ce n’est pas normal!</span>” And then he makes a face that suggests that everyone simply must agree. For the most part, they do. Just as we put our summer dresses in boxes and start looking for the ice skates, so we bid farewell to plum tarts and apricot desserts. It’s not really goodbye, though—it’s <span class="italic">au revoir.</span> We’ll be seeing them again, but first we have other foods to tend to: pumpkins, beets, apples, pears, game.</div>
<div class="fullpageimage_flow" id="div24"><img alt="" src="images/Thor_9780804185608_epub_007_r1.jpg"/></div>
<div class="indent" id="div25"><a id="page15"/>It’s so much fun to chase the seasons and cook with fleeting ingredients, to embrace every month and the gifts it brings. Why should anyone want to eat the same things week in week out when every season offers new discoveries and endless possibilities? If I can inspire people to cook good food with high-quality ingredients, using simple everyday French recipes, I will have achieved something. If I can make someone feel that we can all, at some point, live our dreams one way or another, change our lives if we wish to, even if it’s just to try it out, then so much the better.</div>
