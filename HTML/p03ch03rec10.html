<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">I tried several versions of these fritters, some with the fish mixed with a batter of flour and water or flour and milk, some just with potatoes and egg. These are fluffy and slightly moist. You may be able to buy desalted salt cod, vacuum-packed or frozen. If not, make these with fresh cod.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">MAKES ABOUT 23 SMALL FRITTERS</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 to 2 baking potatoes (about 9 ounces), peeled and quartered</p>
<p class="qun">½ pound desalted bacalao (salt cod; see page 338), or skinless fresh cod fillet</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">2 large eggs, lightly beaten</p>
<p class="qun">2 garlic cloves, crushed to a paste</p>
<p class="qun">2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="qun">½ teaspoon baking powder</p>
<p class="qun">4 to 5 tablespoons beer</p>
<p class="qun">2 tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley</p>
<p class="qun1">Olive or sunflower oil for deep-frying</p>
<p class="recsum">Boil the potatoes in salted water until soft; drain and mash them.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Remove any skin and bones from the desalted salt cod, if using it, and poach it for 2 minutes, then drain. When it is cool enough to handle, finely shred it with your fingers. If you are using fresh cod, simply poach it for 3 minutes, or until it just begins to flake.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Mix the fish and potatoes in a bowl, and add salt and pepper to taste; even salt cod might need some salt if it has been desalted excessively. Add the eggs, garlic, flour, baking powder, beer, and parsley and beat very well. Leave the creamy paste to rest for about 2 hours covered in the fridge.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Heat ½ inch of oil in a wide skillet until a small piece of bread sizzles when you drop it in but does not brown too quickly. Drop small portions—about 2 tablespoons worth—of the cod mixture into the oil, in batches, and cook over medium heat until the little fritters are golden, turning them over once. Drain on paper towels.</p>
