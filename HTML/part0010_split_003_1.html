  <h3 class="h3a">Slow-cooked marinated beef with chocolate</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">Although adding chocolate to savoury dishes is a South American tradition, it has become increasingly popular in Italian dishes – cocoa powder is even added to pasta dough! I must say I am not too keen on these gimmicky recipes; however, the addition of a little good-quality dark chocolate to slow-cooked beef does enrich the sauce.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">1kg/2lb 4oz stewing beef, cut into chunks</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 onions, sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 carrots, sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 bay leaves</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 garlic clove, left whole, crushed 250ml/9fl oz/1 cup red wine</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 tsp red wine vinegar</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">a handful of parsley, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 sprigs of thyme, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">400ml/14fl oz/1⅔ cups <a href="part0007_split_005.html#pg21" class="calibre1">beef stock</a> – or use a stock cube</p>

  <p class="ing1">30g/1oz dark chocolate, grated</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing2">3 potatoes, cut into chunks</p>

  <p class="para">Rinse the beef under cold running water and pat dry. Place in a bowl with the onions, carrots, bay leaves and garlic. Pour in the wine and vinegar, cover with clingfilm (plastic wrap) and put in the fridge to marinate for 8 hours or overnight.</p>

  <p class="para">Discard the garlic clove, drain the liquid and set aside. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan and brown the beef well all over. Add the onions, carrots and bay leaves and sweat for about 4 minutes, until the onion has softened. Stir in the parsley and thyme, pour in the marinade liquid and stock and stir in the chocolate, some salt and pepper. Reduce the heat, partially cover with a lid and cook on a low heat for 1½ hours.</p>

  <p class="para">Remove the lid, add the potatoes and cook on a medium heat for a further 30 minutes, until the potatoes are cooked and the liquid has reduced slightly. Serve immediately.</p>
