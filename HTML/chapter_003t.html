<h2 class="h2b">CARRE D’AGNEAU PROVENCAL</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Rack of Lamb with a Herb Crust</em></h3>
<p class="normall"><em>This is as Provençal as it gets – spring lamb scented with garden herbs and a simple sauce: no muddying of flavours, and a pure pleasure to eat. Whenever I attempt a different way of serving rack of lamb, I’m always disappointed. I’ve never been one to get stuck in my ways, but this is an exception. I come back to this dish every time, the only variation being savory instead of rosemary or thyme in the breadcrumbs</em>.</p>
<p class="normalla0"><em>Make sure you order the lamb a little in advance: ask for it to be French trimmed, with the chine bone removed, and insist that the trimmings and bones are chopped and kept for you to make the jus. The amount of trimmings that you get from each rack is plenty to make more than enough jus for each portion. It is best to buy either two racks from the neck end, which are slightly more flavoursome, or two best ends that are easier to carve</em>.</p>
<div class="hang0">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
2 best or neck ends of spring lamb (about 8 ribs each)<br/>
2 tbsp vegetable oil<br/>
2 tbsp Dijon mustard<br/>
1 recipe Provençal Breadcrumbs (<em><a href="chapter_001i.html#page31">see here</a></em>)</p>
</div>
<div class="hang00">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">JUS</span><br/>
All the lamb bones and trimmings<br/>
2 tbsp vegetable oil<br/>
¼ onion, peeled and chopped<br/>
1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed<br/>
1 ripe Roma tomato, about 90g (3¼ oz), chopped<br/>
1 tbsp tomato concentrate<br/>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 200°C/400°F/Gas 6.</p>
<p class="normala">For the jus, roast the lamb bones and trimmings in the vegetable oil for about 20 minutes in the preheated oven. You need to get them nice and dark and they should smell like the aroma coming from the oven when you open it to a cooked roast of lamb. Put a sieve in the top of a saucepan and tip the bones into it to remove any excess oil without burning yourself or losing any bones. Return the bones to the roasting tray, add the chopped onion and garlic, chopped tomato and tomato concentrate, and mix them in well. Cook them, stirring occasionally, until all is well browned and the tomato concentrate smells like dried tomatoes, about 10–15 minutes. Remove it all from the oven, add about 200ml (7fl oz) water to the pan, and scrape the bottom to remove any caramelised juices. Pour this into a saucepan, bring it all to the boil, skim the stock and simmer for about 1 hour. Strain through a fine sieve and reduce to taste. (If you get the taste you want but would like the jus a little thicker, just dilute a little cornflour in water, boil the sauce and whisk it in little by little.) Season well with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="normala">Heat the vegetable oil in an ovenproof pan and sear the racks on their flesh side for 2 minutes until golden brown. Turn the racks on to their fat sides and roast in the preheated oven for 12 minutes if using the best ends, 15 if using the neck ends. Remove the lamb and let it cool a little. Spread the mustard over both sides of the meat and press in the breadcrumbs until it is all completely coated. Put the pieces of lamb on a rack over the top of a tray until you need them.</p>
<p class="normala">You can prepare the rack of lamb up to this point 3–4 hours in advance. When you are ready to serve, roast the racks again in the oven for another 6–8 minutes (poke with a skewer to make sure they are hot inside). Leave to rest for 5 minutes then heat the jus, slice the racks and serve with some roasted vegetables or ratatouille (<em><a href="chapter_003l.html#page94">see here</a></em>).</p>
<p class="normal2"><span class="smallcaps">ON MAKING JUS</span></p>
<p class="normala">If you are put off making sauces and jus because you regard them as time-consuming, please reconsider. With a jus such as the one here, there is not actually that much time spent cooking. Why not make the jus three days before you need it?</p>
