<p class="summary">Various types of dry pasta made of durum wheat, all of them short (about 1 to 1½ inches), are called <span class="italic">fideos</span> in Spain, or <span class="italic">fideus</span> in Catalan. The name derives from <span class="italic">fidawsh</span>, an Arab word for “pasta.” Fourteenth-century Catalan cookbooks have recipes for <span class="italic">fideus</span> and for <span class="italic">aletria</span>, an alternative word for “pasta” derived from the Arabic <span class="italic">itria</span>. Fideos come in various thicknesses that are graded from 0 to 4. Size 0 is vermicelli-like, and it is also called <span class="italic">cabello de ángel</span> (angel’s hair). (For this you can use vermicelli nests—break them in your hands into small pieces.) There is also a thin spaghettini and a thicker spaghetti, as well as a small curved macaroni pasta.</p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Fideos</span> are cooked like rice in a paella pan, in a casserole or earthenware dish, or in a pot, and like rice in Spain, they are cooked in stock or in a sauce, not in boiling water. In Catalonia, they are sometimes first fried in oil—then they are called <span class="italic">rossejats</span>. Catalonia and Valencia have a variety of pasta dishes. <span class="italic">Fideos</span> are a legacy of the Arabs. Italian-style pastas such as <span class="italic">caneloni</span>, <span class="italic">pene</span>, and <span class="italic">macaroni</span> date back to the nineteenth century when a large number of Italian cooks opened restaurants or came to work for the newly wealthy Catalan and Basque bourgeoisies. These have become Spanish in style and flavor.</p>
