</h1>
<p class="pf">Several years ago, when I toured a food company in Chicago, a salesman pulled me aside and asked, “What do you do in Minnesota with all the marshmallows we sell there?” He was a little taken aback by my response: “We put them into green Jell-O and call it a salad. Then we take the salad to a potluck supper at church, where it is served with a macaroni hot dish.”</p>
<p>One year, a woman contacted me for suggestions on changing the Lenten Wednesday night suppers at her church. “For way too many years,” she said, “we’ve had a spaghetti bake, lasagna, sloppy joes, chili, and more with lettuce salad bars. It’s just too much sameness! Change is difficult for Lutherans, but there must be more to life.”</p>
<p>Yes, there can be more to church suppers—or any other large gathering, for that matter. The menu doesn’t <i>have</i>
 to have white bread, sliced ham or bologna, sloppy joes or pizza, and iceberg lettuce. It’s a perfect venue for a food enthusiast to offer more sophisticated choices.</p>
<p>Times have indeed changed, especially in our church kitchen. It really didn’t take that much effort.</p>
<p>What prompted the change was, of all things, the Lenten season, the forty days before Easter. Wednesday night suppers during Lent had become mundane and monotonous. Soup and sandwiches were to be the theme, but nobody wanted to help out or even partake in the meals. We went from canned soups and bologna-and-cheese sandwiches on white store-bought bread to having people make sandwiches at home and then trade them at the supper. Attendance was at an all-time low.</p>
<p>Peter Strommen was our pastor at the time—and he was a master at analyzing situations and empowering people. His plea to me was, “Do something. I don’t care what it is, but do something to change the Lenten suppers!”</p>
<p>In rummaging around all the old equipment in the storage room of the church basement, I discovered a twenty-quart Hobart mixer with a whisk and paddle, covered with dust and grime. We brought that up into the kitchen, ordered a dough hook for it, and then we were in the business of mixing bread dough—a project right up my alley!</p>
<p>That was when we started serving homemade bread and offering freshly sliced cheese and cold cuts. This allowed people to make their own sandwiches. Alongside the sandwiches, we served a quickly made soup.</p>
<p>People loved the wild rice bread I had been making at home and bringing to the suppers. It was a recipe I had adapted from one my friend Susan Poupore had created when I worked on a project for the Wild Rice Council. We make that bread in large batches of sixteen loaves at a time. In addition to the wild rice bread we usually make a white bread, fashioned after the recipe we used at Somebody’s House, as well as another variety of bread just so people have a choice.</p>
<p>Baking bread fills the entire church with a wonderful, enticing aroma. A couple of years later we began roasting vegetables—mostly root veggies that are in season and available in the late winter/early spring. To round out the menu we made soup. Sometimes a long-simmered split pea, bean, or root vegetable soup—a different variety every week of the six weeks.</p>
<p>Volunteers for the kitchen have found the work rewarding—people come to learn something about different foods, mixing bread dough, all that spiced by the inspiration of being together in a kitchen. Lenten suppers have become an energizing time.</p>
<p>We slice our own cold cuts and cheese instead of buying already sliced and nicely arranged trays. We figure we save a lot of money this way. Men and women with artistic bents can try their hand at creating and arranging beautiful trays of raw veggies, roasted veggies, and sandwich fillings. The results have been amazing.</p>
<p>To round out the meals we have a variety of salads and at least two choices of soups. Nowhere in town can anybody buy such a meal for a “donation.” We always hope the donations will cover the expenses. They always have. At least so far.</p>
<p>Besides offering the value of a meal to our guests, there is nothing like working together in a kitchen, scrubbing and peeling carrots, potatoes, and other vegetables, for providing camaraderie. It also has always been fun to introduce new flavors, combinations, and techniques that people can take home and use.</p>
<p>When committees have been formed for the ubiquitous “forward planning” sessions, the cry has routinely been “Don’t mess with Lent!” A friend named Marcia, who is a piano teacher, once told me that kids wouldn’t schedule their piano lessons on Wednesdays during Lent because of the wonderful community meals at the church.</p>
<p>Church kitchens, however, have one common problem: dull knives! Sometimes we have had all our knives professionally sharpened, but within a couple of weeks, they’re all dull again. There are more casualties with dull cutting utensils than with sharp ones. And so the call always goes out: “Bring sharp knives!”</p>

<p class="rpill">8 to 10 pounds bread flour</p>

<p class="rph1">1 loaf</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpil">1 cup warm water (about 110°F)</p>
<p class="rpil">2 tablespoons honey</p>
<p class="rpil">1 package or tablespoon active dry yeast</p>
<p class="rpil">1½ teaspoons salt</p>
<p class="rpil">2 tablespoons shortening or oil</p>
<p class="rpil">¼ cup uncooked quick rolled oats</p>
<p class="rpil">¼ cup whole wheat flour</p>
<p class="rpil">¼ cup dark rye flour</p>
<p class="rpil">¼ cup cooked and very well drained wild rice*</p>
<p class="rpil">2¼ cups bread flour</p>
</div>
<p class="rph1">Glaze and topping</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpil">1 egg, beaten with 2 tablespoons water</p>
<p class="rpill">Toasted, salted sunflower seeds</p>
</div>
<p class="rpn">* Cook 1 cup wild rice according to package directions until very soft; be sure to cool thoroughly before adding to the bread.</p>
<p class="rpf">Combine warm water, honey, and yeast in large mixing bowl. Let stand 5 minutes until yeast bubbles. Add the salt, shortening or oil, rolled oats, wheat flour, rye flour, and wild rice; mix at low speed until smooth. Slowly add the bread flour; turn mixer on low to medium speed for about 10 minutes or until the dough is well mixed, pulls away from the sides of the bowl, and has a slightly tacky feel. Cover and let rise until doubled (about 1 hour). Divide the large batch of dough into 16 parts and shape each into an oblong or round loaf. Place on lightly greased pans, 4 or 5 per large sheet pan. Cover and let rise until almost doubled, about 45 minutes. Brush loaves with the egg-water mixture and sprinkle with the sunflower seeds. Slash loaves with a sharp blade in two or three places.</p>
<p class="rp">Bake in a 375°F regular oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or in a commercial convection oven set at 350°F for about 20 minutes or until a wooden skewer inserted through the loaf comes out clean and dry. Cool on a rack, and slice for serving.</p>
<p class="rpy">Makes 10 generous slices per loaf</p>
