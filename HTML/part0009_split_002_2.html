  <p class="chap-para">This lovely roasted pumpkin makes an ideal antipasto served alongside some Parma ham and lots of good bread or crostini. The vinegar marinade gives the pumpkin a ‘kick’ and gets your taste buds going. This can be rustic or more elegant: marinate the pumpkin in four small ramekins and turn out onto serving plates. It can be made the day before and left in the fridge overnight – but serve at room temperature.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">extra virgin olive oil, to grease and drizzle</p>

  <p class="ing1">850g/1lb 14oz peeled and deseeded pumpkin, finely sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt</p>

  <p class="ing1">150ml/5fl oz/⅔ cup white wine vinegar</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 small shallots, finely sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 small bay leaves</p>

  <p class="ing1">6 black peppercorns</p>

  <p class="ing2">a handful of basil leaves, plus extra to garnish</p>

  <p class="para">Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas mark 4. Lightly grease a baking sheet with olive oil, put the pumpkin slices on top, sprinkle with salt and drizzle with more olive oil. Roast in the oven for 30 minutes, until golden and cooked through but not mushy. Remove and leave to cool.</p>

  <p class="para">Put the vinegar, shallots, bay leaves and peppercorns in a small pan and bring to the boil. Remove from the heat and leave to cool.</p>

  <p class="para1">In a non-metallic container, make layers of pumpkin, basil leaves and the vinegar marinade. Leave to marinate for at least 4 hours – or overnight in the fridge. Bring to room temperature before serving, drizzle over some extra virgin olive oil and scatter over a few fresh basil leaves.</p>
