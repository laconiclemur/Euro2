<p class="author1"><span class="txit">tiramisu della livia</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Gianni’s sister Livia perfected this recipe for tiramisu. “I prefer my sister Livia’s tiramisu to all others I’ve tried,” claims Gianni. “Having tasted her share of tiramisu at the homes of friends and relatives, Livia took the elements that she liked best about each recipe (not too sweet, not too heavy, etc.) and incorporated them into a recipe of her own.” Her secret? A well-beaten egg-and-sugar mixture to minimize the “eggy” flavor.</p>
<p class="indentb">It is best to make this dish the day before serving so that the tiramisu has ample time to set. It also freezes well. You can extend the recipe to provide more servings by folding whipped cream into the mascarpone along with the egg whites. The width and length of ladyfinger cookies can vary from brand to brand, though generally a 7-ounce package will fill the rectangular dish recommended here.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 large eggs, separated</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup sugar</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 pound mascarpone cheese</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup crushed amaretti cookies (optional)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cups brewed espresso coffee</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon dark rum (such as Myers’s), Grand Marnier, or Cointreau</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">One 7-ounce package ladyfinger cookies</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> In a medium-size bowl, beat the egg yolks with 6 tablespoons of the sugar until foamy and pale. Beat in the mascarpone until smooth. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> In a large bowl, whip the egg whites with an electric mixer. When they are frothy, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar. Continue beating until they hold stiff peaks. Fold the egg whites into the mascarpone mixture, then fold in the crushed amaretti cookies, if using. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Mix the espresso with the rum in a shallow bowl. Soak each ladyfinger, one at a time, in this mixture until it has softened slightly and absorbed some of the liquid. (The cookies <a id="page_345"/>should not be mushy, but your fingers should be able to make a light indentation in them.) Arrange the cookies in an 11 x 7 x 2-inch baking dish to form a tightly packed single layer. Use pieces of broken cookies to fill in any gaps. (If the cookies seem dry, a small amount of the coffee mixture may be spooned on top.)</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Spread the mascarpone cream mixture evenly over the cookies. Shake the cocoa through a fine-mesh sieve to evenly coat the top. Refrigerate to set for at least 2 hours before serving.</p>
