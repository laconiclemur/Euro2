<p class="summary">I hope the recipes in this book will inspire you and that you will get a lot of pleasure from cooking and eating Spanish dishes. Here are some general suggestions for achieving good results.</p>
<p class="bl-first">• Always buy good ingredients, the best you can afford—very fresh fish, good meat, and, if possible, free-range organic chickens and eggs.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• Use sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, unsalted butter, and whole milk.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• Buy unwaxed lemons when you will be using the grated zest or strips of peel.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• Wash your vegetables and fruits. I wash and rub my chickens with lemon juice—a measure of hygiene learnt in Egypt—but now I hear that there is no need even to wash them, as any bacteria would die after a good time in a hot oven.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• Cooking is about pleasure, about pleasing yourself and pleasing others. You have to like what you cook. When you follow these recipes, you must also follow your instincts and use your good sense. When you cook, you have to look and touch and smell, and you have to adjust seasonings and flavorings to your own taste. The time needed to fry a chopped onion, for example, varies depending on its size, the type and amount of oil, the size of the pan and whether it is heavy or light, and the heat. You have to decide how soft you like it and how golden. What is low heat for you might be medium-low for someone else. If your tomatoes are tasteless or too acidic, you will need to add a little more sugar. The heads of garlic that you get might be bigger than the one I get, so use as much as you like.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• Ovens vary, and their heat is not always accurate. Cooking time also depends on whether a dish was cold from the refrigerator when it went in. So look in the oven and take the food out a little before time or leave it in the oven for a little longer if necessary.</p>
<p class="bl-last">• Spanish cooking does not have strict rules like French haute cuisine. In Spain, everyone feels they can have their own way of doing things—and so should you. You will acquire skills by cooking the same recipe over again, but do always feel that if a dish tastes good to you, that is how it should be.</p>
