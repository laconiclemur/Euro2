<p class="author1"><span class="txit">salsa marinara</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This sauce takes its name from the fresh, simple marinara sauces that fishermen’s wives would prepare to accompany the catch of the day. We call it Sailor’s-Style to distinguish it from <a class="nounder" href="ach58.html#page_119">Joan’s Basic Tomato Sauce</a>. The ingredients for both sauces are essentially the same—the difference lies in the cooking technique. This Sailor’s-Style marinara sauce is cooked in a large uncovered pan so the tomatoes break down, creating an intensely flavored, thick sauce. Joan’s Basic Tomato Sauce is cooked in a small covered saucepan, resulting in a lighter, soupier sauce. For either sauce, whenever I shop for canned tomatoes, I look for ones from the San Marzano area of Italy. They are the finest. This sauce may be prepared several days ahead and refrigerated or frozen. Reheat slowly before serving. Serve over pasta or with other dishes as noted throughout the book.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 cloves garlic</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon chopped onions</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 cups canned whole plum tomatoes (about one 35-ounce can)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano leaves or <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> teaspoon dried (optional)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 fresh basil leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">Warm the olive oil in a large sauté or frying pan (about 12 inches in diameter) set over a medium-high heat. Add the garlic and onions and cook until the onions are soft but not browned, about 2 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, crushing them with your hands or with the back of a slotted spoon as you add them to the pan. Stir in the oregano (if using) and basil, and season with salt and pepper. Simmer until the tomatoes have thickened and sweetened, about 25 minutes (the longer you cook this sauce, the thicker it will become). Remove from the heat and allow to rest so the sauce thickens slightly and the flavors come together, about 5 minutes.</p>
