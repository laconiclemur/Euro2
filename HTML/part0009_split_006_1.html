  <h3 class="h3a"><a id="ch3sec6a" class="calibre1"></a>Meatballs</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">This is a fantastically simple recipe you can make with the beef cooked for the <a href="part0007_split_005.html#ch1sec4a" class="calibre1">beef broth</a>; in the past, Italian housewives would always make <em class="calibre4">polpette</em> this way or with leftover roast beef. When we have leftover boiled or roast beef, my wife Liz often makes meatballs or burgers for the children. These meatballs can also be frozen. <em class="calibre4">Polpette</em> are delicious eaten as they are or with a tomato sauce, served with pasta or added to a lasagne. If you turn the beef into burgers, serve with some good bread buns, salad and cheese and enjoy, as my girls do, a homemade treat!</p>

  <p class="ing">Makes about 40 meatballs or 20 burgers</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 quantity of beef from <a href="part0007_split_005.html#ch1sec4a" class="calibre1">beef broth</a></p>

  <p class="ing1">3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 onions, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">a handful of parsley, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">115g/4oz bread, grated into fine crumbs</p>

  <p class="ing1">100g/3½oz Parmesan, grated</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 eggs</p>

  <p class="ing1">plain (all-purpose) flour, to dust</p>

  <p class="ing2">olive oil for frying</p>

  <p class="para">Drain the beef from the broth and chop into large chunks; put the chunks in a food processor and whizz until well minced (ground). Alternatively, chop the beef very finely with a sharp knife.</p>

  <p class="para">Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the onions and sweat on a low heat for about 10 minutes, until softened. Leave to cool.</p>

  <p class="para">Combine the minced beef with the cooled onion, parsley, breadcrumbs, Parmesan, salt and pepper to taste, and the eggs. Shape into balls about the size of walnuts; alternatively shape into burgers. Place on a lightly greased baking tin or dish, cover with clingfilm (plastic wrap) and place in the fridge for about an hour. Alternatively, place in a container, seal and freeze for later use.</p>

  <p class="para1">Dust the meatballs with a little flour, heat some oil in a frying pan and fry the meatballs in the hot oil until lightly browned on all sides. Do this in batches, depending on the size of your pan. Drain on kitchen paper and keep warm until all are cooked. If you are making burgers, fry them for a couple of minutes on each side. Serve with pasta or buns and salad.</p>
