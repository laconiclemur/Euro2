<p class="summary"><span class="italic">In Asturias, I stayed with the</span> New Yorker <span class="italic">journalist Jane Kramer in Jaime Rodríguez and his wife Marichu’s farmhouse in Llenín, near Cangas de Onis. We had met Jaime in the street and he had invited us to stay. It is a little mountain paradise with a sweeping view of the Picos de Europa mountains. Once upon a time, cows slept on the ground floor in the winter and Jaime went to school with the donkey cart that took their milk to town. Now the farmhouse has been transformed into a beautiful and welcoming</span> casa rural, <span class="italic">a family guesthouse, called Heredad de la Cueste. We sat beside the fire as Jaime told us how life had been in the Asturian mountains not long ago. Rural tourism is now the basis of the economy. Marichu works as a guide in the Picos de Europa national park. Her mother cooks traditional food, using local produce, for the guests. We had</span> <span class="italic">casadielles</span>, <span class="italic">fried pastry rolls filled with walnuts, for breakfast.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">At home, I tried several different pastry doughs. This one with olive oil worked best. It can be rolled out easily to make a thin crisp crust for the soft, moist, aromatic walnut filling. In Asturias, it is usual to fry the pastries, but I find they are better baked.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">MAKES 12</span> <span class="bolditalic">CASADIELLES</span></p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE DOUGH</span></p>
<p class="qun">½ cup olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup warm water</p>
<p class="qun">½ teaspoon superfine sugar</p>
<p class="qun1">About 2⅓ cups all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE FILLING</span></p>
<p class="qun">1¾ cups walnuts</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup superfine sugar</p>
<p class="qun">2 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="qun1">3 to 4 tablespoons anise-flavored liqueur (you can use ouzo, pastis, or arak)</p>
<p class="qun">1 egg yolk, beaten with 1 teaspoon water, for egg wash</p>
<p class="qun1">Confectioners’ sugar for dusting</p>
<p class="recsum">For the dough, mix the oil, water, and sugar in a bowl, beating vigorously with a fork. Then gradually work in enough flour to get a soft, smooth, malleable dough that is not sticky: begin by stirring in the flour with the fork, then work it in with your hands and knead briefly. You can use the dough right away or keep it wrapped in plastic wrap, at room temperature, not in the refrigerator, until you are ready to use it.</p>
<p class="recsum1">For the filling, grind the walnuts a little coarsely with the sugar and butter in a food processor. Add the liqueur and blend very briefly.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Divide the dough into 2 pieces, to make rolling easier. Roll each piece out into a large rectangle about ⅛ inch thick; do not flour the surface or the rolling pin—the dough is oily and will not stick. Cut each sheet of dough into 6 rectangles about 3½ by 5 inches.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Take a lump of filling the size of a walnut, shape it into a loose sausage, and lay it along the edge of a long side of a dough rectangle. Using your little finger or a cotton swab, paint a thin line of the egg wash along the other remaining 3 sides (this is to make the dough stick better), then roll up like a cigar and pinch the ends firmly together. Repeat with the remaining dough rectangles and filling, and arrange the <span class="italic">casadielles</span> on an oiled baking sheet. Brush them with the egg wash, and bake in a preheated 300°F oven for about 30 minutes, or until slightly golden. Let cool before moving the pastries to a serving plate and dusting them with confectioners’ sugar.</p>
