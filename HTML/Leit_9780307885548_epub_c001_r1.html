  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">W</span>hen I was a kid, this was a treat I’d look forward to every autumn. My father has always had a huge garden in the backyard, and squash is one of his favorite crops. After he harvested them, we pulled the seeds right from the guts of the gourds, washed them, and tossed them in spices before popping them in the oven. Because we had a limited supply, we ate them sparingly on cold Sunday morning walks. He’s fond of calling them “Portuguese popcorn.”</p>

You can use whole seeds for a more rustic crunch, as my dad does, if you wish. What I like about this recipe is that you can tinker with it, adding more or less of each spice to suit your taste. It’s a perfect accompaniment to a crisp, effervescent</em> vinho verde, <em>nicely chilled.</em></p>

  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">P</span><em>astéis de bacalhau</em>, salt cod fritters, are a staple in just about every restaurant, <em>tasca</em> (small family-run eatery), and home in Portugal. When I lived in Lisbon, I’d spend afternoons at different cafés in the Baixa and Chiado districts, and there were always platters heaped high with the fritters pressed up against the front windows.</p>

  <p class="indent">This version adds another Portuguese favorite to the mix: shrimp. It gives the fritters a sweetness and lighter flavor, ideal for those still acquiring a taste for salt cod. And, unlike many of the fritters I’ve eaten all over Portugal, some of which can be veritable belly bombs, these are exceptionally light, a result accomplished by separating the egg, whipping the white, and then gingerly folding it into the mixture.</p>

So they peeled the skins thick enough to be fried up as a bar snack. The flavor comes from frying the curls in an herb-infused oil. The result? Every bite is full of crunchy potato and crisp flecks of herbs.</p>

  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">T</span>he Portuguese are just mad about their sausages and press them into service in just about every course. I’ve had many versions of this starter. Some contain a mixture of chouriço, <em>morcela</em> (blood sausage), and soft <em>farinheira</em> (sausage stuffed with flour and pork drippings). Others, like this one, rely solely on the flavor of the chouriço to carry the dish—so <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_itr2_r1.htm#s038">choosing an excellent sausage</a> is imperative.</p>
