  <p class="ct1" id="id8"><span class="italic"><span class="pink">Pâté bourbonnais aux pommes de terre</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindenti"><span class="red"><span class="italic">“The pâté bourbonnais? A very local recipe in every way—its name, its ingredients, the know-how necessary to make it, and especially what it is:</span> un rien trublion, <span class="italic">a little troublemaker. As was considered the old province of the Bourbonnais, the land now called the Allier, from early on was regarded as unruly by the government of the Auvergne, which tried to annihilate it, unsuccessfully.</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindenti"><span class="red"><span class="italic">“The pâté bourbonnais is like that, mutinous. It goes against all the traditions of the culinary canon. Potatoes? Encased in pastry? And flooded with heavy cream? Such an unlikely union. Yet all who taste it are won over.</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindenti"><span class="red"><span class="italic">“Another confirmation of its local authenticity is that it is best eaten only with other products of the Bourbonnais. The rougette or doucette lettuce grown in the mud of the Allier banks, or the ham air-dried in our Bourbonnais mountains, and of course the white Auvergne wine of Saint-Pourçain—a unique cépage that balances perfectly the richness of our pâté.</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindenti"><span class="red"><span class="italic">“Omit or add any ingredient at your own risk. Beware of turning our pâté into a most improbable pudding!”</span></span></p>

  <p class="right_red">Gérard Charasse</p>

  <p class="right_red"><span class="italic">Deputy of Allier</span></p>

  <p class="noindenti1"><span class="italic"><span class="red">“The potato pâté was born in the farming country between Target and Voussac in the Allier in 1789, a time of great food shortage. In those days the farmers, all observing the religious rules strictly, never ate meat on Fridays. To add to the privation, they were not permitted to fish the ponds in the woodlands belonging to their Bourbon overlords. What were they to do?</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindenti"><span class="red"><span class="italic">“With the few components they were able to scare up, they devised a new Friday meal consisting of a potato-filled two-crust pie, cooked without liquid and then infused with crème fraiche, an ingredient all farms had in good supply.</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindenti"><span class="red"><span class="italic">“This pâté bourbonnais has survived the years, and today many bakeries in the region as well as local restaurants offer the potato pâté every Friday.”</span></span></p>

  <p class="right_red">Jean Mallot</p>

  <p class="right_red"><span class="italic">Deputy of Allier</span></p>

  <p class="noindenti1"><span class="italic"><span class="red">“Among the excellent recipes from the Auvergne, the most ubiquitous in the Allier is without doubt this very pâté. All three of us agree that our pâté bourbonnais represents the best that our region has to offer. This is the gourmet version, although some who incline more toward gourmand may add ham, or even turn it into a dessert by substituting pears.”</span></span></p>

With a knife, cut out a cross in the middle and fold back the four corners to create a chimney. For decorative effect, make light incisions all around. In a small bowl, lightly beat the egg yolk with 2 tablespoons water. Brush top of pie with this egg wash. Bake 45–60 minutes.</p>

Like so many in French gastronomy, it was born out of poverty, long ago, when meat was rare and literally every animal part had to be used. This recipe is not for the faint of heart. It also requires that you enjoy a good relationship with your butcher. The secret for making this traditional specialty is cooking it for seven hours. A tip from Sisteron chefs is to prepare the dish the day before.</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindenti"><span class="rose"><span class="italic">“This recipe comes from Mr. Jacques Guistini, butcher-charcutier in Sisteron. It is made with the Red Label lamb—a distinction awarded by the government guaranteeing that the lamb is of local origin and pasture-fed.

It is so much a part of their culture that each year Sisteron holds a Concours des Pieds et Paquets, with prizes, inviting amateurs to compete along with professionals.

  <p class="noindenti"><span class="blue1"><span class="italic">“The famous farcidure is known to all Corréziens. But there are many towns in the Corrèze, each with its own farcidure, so to tell them apart, almost all of them bear a second name as well. Argentat’s farcidure is called</span> poule sans os <span class="italic">or</span> poule seize <span class="italic">or</span> colombette. <span class="italic">The one from Brive is</span> mique<span class="italic">; from Treignac,</span> mounassou. <span class="italic">Only the dish from Tulle is referred to simply as farcidure.

  <p class="noindenti"><span class="blue1"><span class="italic">“How could every Corrézien possibly cook the same way, after all, when one lives half a mile high and another almost at sea level? Some live on the banks of the Dordogne, near Quercy, some on the Millevaches Plateau. So many different altitudes, climates, cultures, within one department. Our cuisine reflects these differences.</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindenti"><span class="blue1"><span class="italic">“The</span> milhassou <span class="italic">has for its base potatoes. In the environs of Égletons, before the potato arrived, millet was the main fare. In those days people used to soak their millet, and because millet is rather bland, they added chopped herbs and vegetables. The farcidure was cooked in a bit of pork fat until crisp on one side, then on the other,</span> et voilà<span class="italic">!</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindenti"><span class="blue1"><span class="italic">“Then potatoes arrived. In order to give the potato a texture similar to that of millet, the women of the Corrèze devised a metal tool with points that scraped the potato into shreds. This tool has evolved into what we know today as a grater.</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindenti"><span class="blue1"><span class="italic">“This is how women fed their families, for years and years. On practically nothing. And yet the dish survived. Today, Corréziens salivate at the mere mention of farcidure.</span></span></p>

  <p class="ct1" id="id172"><span class="italic"><span class="rose">Pastis du Quercy</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindenti"><span class="blue2"><span class="italic">The Lot department in the southwest of France, part of the old province of Languedoc, is named after its river Lot, a tributary of the Garonne. The Lot produces wine, especially around Cahors, and a full range of foodstuffs.</span> Pastis <span class="italic">here is not the anise-flavored aperitif popular in southern France, but a supremely delicate pastry. It is also a word meaning “a sticky situation.”</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindenti"><span class="blue2"><span class="italic">“Our</span> pastis <span class="italic">is one of the most emblematic and most delectable desserts from a long Quercy tradition. This aromatic, crisp yet melt-in-your-mouth recipe used to be passed down from mother to daughter. Nowadays it is seldom made, for it takes a lot of time and attention to detail. An extremely thin dough flavored with eau-de-vie is stretched into a long sheet before assembling the pastry with slices of apple and pear. Patience is needed, and elbow room, and of course a serious touch of gourmandise.”</span></span></p>

  <p class="shd"><span class="rose"><span class="bold"><span class="u">Serves 7–8</span></span></span></p>

  <p class="ing"><span class="rose">6 cups flour</span></p>

  <p class="ing"><span class="rose">4 eggs</span></p>

  <p class="ing"><span class="rose">pinch of salt</span></p>

  <p class="ing"><span class="rose">2 cups warm water</span></p>

  <p class="ing"><span class="rose">8 tablespoons butter</span></p>

  <p class="ing"><span class="rose">1/2 cup canola oil</span></p>

  <p class="ing"><span class="rose">1 apple</span></p>

  <p class="ing"><span class="rose">1 pear</span></p>

  <p class="ing"><span class="rose">1 tablespoon orange flower water</span></p>

  <p class="ing"><span class="rose">2 tablespoons eau-de-vie</span></p>

  <p class="ing"><span class="rose">2 tablespoons vanilla extract</span></p>

  <p class="ing"><span class="rose">1 cup sugar</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2"><span class="rose">✓</span> In a large bowl, put the flour and salt, make a well in the center of the flour, and crack the eggs into it. Slowly pouring in the warm water, work the mixture into a soft, smooth dough. This must be done long and thoroughly, so as to incorporate air, which will allow the dough to develop. Cover with film, and let rest 3 hours.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="rose">✓</span> Lay a fine tablecloth or bedsheet over a large table, ideally 6 feet square. Place the dough in the center of the cloth. It will begin to spread by itself. Slide your hands underneath the cloth and work the dough, nudging it outward with your fingers until it gradually covers the whole work surface in a very thin layer, like cigarette paper. Let it rest 10 minutes.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="rose">✓</span> Preheat oven to 350°F.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="rose">✓</span> Melt butter and mix with oil. With a pastry brush, paint the dough sheet entirely.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="rose">✓</span> Peel and core the apple and pear. Slice very finely. Place fruit evenly over dough.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="rose">✓</span> In a small bowl, combine orange flower water, eau-de-vie, and vanilla. Sprinkle the entire surface with this liquid, then with sugar.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="rose">✓</span> Grasping one edge of the cloth and lifting, lightly roll the filled dough onto itself to form a tube. Do not tamp down, just keep it rolling by gathering up the cloth. Delicately place the tube, in a spiral, in a round, high baking dish, preferably with a cover.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="rose">✓</span> Bake 20 minutes uncovered until the pastry is nicely colored. Then cover the dish and continue baking 20 minutes more. Remove from oven, unmold, cut into pieces, and serve warm.</p>

  <p class="shd"><span class="pink"><span class="bold"><span class="u">Serves 6–8</span></span></span></p>

  <p class="ing"><span class="pink">1 5-pound chicken</span></p>

  <p class="ing"><span class="pink">10 garlic cloves, peeled</span></p>

  <p class="ing"><span class="pink">Pork rind, enough to line the pot</span></p>

  <p class="ing"><span class="pink">2 onions, peeled and quartered</span></p>

  <p class="ing"><span class="pink">3 leeks, well washed, cut into 2-inch chunks</span></p>

  <p class="ing"><span class="pink">4–5 carrots, peeled and sliced thickly</span></p>

  <p class="ing"><span class="pink">5 turnips, peeled and quartered</span></p>

  <p class="ing"><span class="pink">10 potatoes, peeled and halved</span></p>

  <p class="ing"><span class="pink">1 can tomato paste</span></p>

  <p class="ing"><span class="pink">1 bouquet garni (parsley, celery, bay leaf)</span></p>

  <p class="ing"><span class="pink">Pepper and salt</span></p>

  <p class="ing"><span class="bold"><span class="pink">For the stuffing:</span></span></p>

  <p class="ing"><span class="pink">Liver and gizzard of chicken</span></p>

  <p class="ing"><span class="pink">1 pound pork sausage meat</span></p>

  <p class="ing"><span class="pink">1 pound stale bread, soaked in water and squeezed dry</span></p>

  <p class="ing"><span class="pink">6 eggs</span></p>

  <p class="ing"><span class="pink">Pepper and salt</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2"><span class="rose">✓</span> Start by preparing the stuffing. In the food processor, grind the liver and gizzard. Place them in a bowl with the sausage meat, eggs, bread, pepper, and salt, and mix well. Reserve a small handful for stuffing the bird, and shape the rest of the stuffing into a ball. Enclose it in a sturdy piece of cloth and tie it like a purse with kitchen twine.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="rose">✓</span> Place garlic cloves and reserved stuffing inside chicken. Sew or skewer the opening securely.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="rose">✓</span> In a kettle, line bottom with pork rinds. Place purse of stuffing and chicken on top of rind. Add vegetables, tomato paste, and bouquet garni. Cover with water, at least 2 inches above ingredients. Cook 1 hour over medium heat, reduce to low, and simmer for 1 hour more.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="rose">✓</span> Remove from heat. Taste and adjust seasoning. Cool. Refrigerate at least 5 hours, preferably overnight. A layer of fat will come to the surface. Lift it off and reserve it.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="rose">✓</span> Cook rice, using the chicken fat and sufficient broth from the pot instead of water. The rice will swell greatly and be very delicious, served with the broth, chicken, sliced stuffing, and vegetables. The broth may be served alone first, or in a soup plate along with the rest.</p>
