<p class="center1"><em class="calibre7">Note: Few restaurants in France would dare to have a dessert menu lacking crème brûlée or moelleux au chocolat. ‘Moelleux’ means moist, bordering on gooey.</em></p><p class="center1"><em class="calibre7">I can prepare this recipe while blindfolded with both hands tied behind my back. Ten minutes to prepare, under 20 minutes to bake and it can be served piping hot from the oven.

The taste of almond is barely noticeable in this recipe but it takes the place of flour to give the cake its fabulous consistency)</p><p class="calibre6">½ cup corn starch or preferably potato starch. You can find potato starch in the Jewish cooking section of supermarkets, especially around Passover. I usually buy many boxes at that time because I’m never sure when I’ll find it again.</p><p class="center1"><span class="calibre33"><b class="calibre4">Directions</b></span></p><p class="calibre6">1- Place the stick of butter and the chocolate chips in a microwave-proof dish and cook on high for exactly one minute. Stir until smooth. You might need to heat a few more seconds and re-stir if not smooth.</p><p class="calibre6">2- Preheat oven to 350°F.</p><p class="calibre6">3- In a medium bowl, beat eggs, then add granulated and brown sugar. Stir until well mixed. Add salt and vanilla.</p><p class="calibre6">4- Add the butter and chocolate mixture to the egg and sugar mixture. Beat until homogenous. Add ground raw almond and corn or potato starch. Stir well.</p><p class="calibre6">5- Grease a 9-inch round cake pan. Line the bottom with parchment paper and smear a bit of butter on the paper.</p><p class="calibre6">6- Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan.</p><p class="calibre6">7- Place in the oven. After 25 minutes, insert a blade into the center of the cake. It should come out neither gooey (undercooked, and entirely delicious but my enthusiasm for liquid centers is tempered by my fear of salmonella) nor clean (dry as a bone) but somewhere in between. Serve at room temperature or slightly warm, with vanilla ice cream for full effect.</p></div></div></body></html>
