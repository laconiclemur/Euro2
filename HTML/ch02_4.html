<h2 class="h2"><a id="ch02"/><a id="page_18"/>TAPAS<br/><span class="blue"><small>LITTLE BITES, BIG TASTES</small></span></h2>
<p class="noindent">In a compulsively social country like Spain, the <em>tapeo</em>—tapas bar crawl—is a ritual of near-religious importance. And it isn’t just the nibbling and the imbibing: In Spain, the <em>tapeo</em> embodies a whole worldview and a lifestyle.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_19"/>The verb <em>tapear,</em> says the Sevillian tapas expert Juan Carlos Alonso, “is a broad concept that encompasses multiple actions: drinking, eating, chatting, strolling, greeting, seeing, being seen . . .” Indeed.</p>
<p class="indent">In its original form, the tapa (from the word <em>tapar,</em> to cover) was a free slice of cheese or <em>jamón</em> that topped a glass of sherry, thus protecting the drink from flies and dust. The tradition originated in the nineteenth <a id="page_20"/>century in Andalusia, the center of sherry production, where scorching summers make full meals unthinkable. Besides, a strong, fortified drink such as sherry fairly demands a snack. From these basic beginnings, the tapa evolved into a truly protean concept defined only by size and function: a bite to accompany drinks, normally eaten with one’s hands, standing up. Place a portion of leftover stew in a small <em>cazuela</em> and you’ve got a tapa. Order a beer, chat up your neighbor, and it’s a fiesta. No wonder the Spanish prefer hanging out in bars to entertaining at home.</p>
<p class="indent">Although Spain is presently in the grip of a <em>nueva cocina</em> revolution, old-school tapas bars happily remain true to themselves. Imagine a heart-stoppingly atmospheric tiled dive suffused with the musky scent of <em>jamones</em> (cured hams) hung from the ceiling. Its walls are plastered with bullfighting photos. Its floors are scattered with napkins, toothpicks, and olive pits. The crowds stand wall to wall, shoulder to shoulder, exchanging cracks with the countermen, who shout out orders for another round of briny anchovies or batter-fried bacalao. At classic bars all over Spain, standbys like <em>ensaladilla rusa</em> (a mayonnaise-drenched potato salad), <em>embutidos</em> (cured meats), cheese, and potato <em>tortillas</em> seem inescapable. But beyond these stereotypes, tapas vary dramatically from region to region and from bar to bar.</p>
<p class="indent">Meatballs, <em>patatas bravas</em> (potatoes with spicy tomato sauce), and cups of broth from <em>cocido</em> (boiled dinner) washed down with beer or vermouth on tap are the stuff of old Madrid <em>tabernas.</em> In the northwestern region of Galicia, the <em>tapeo</em> involves squares of seafood empanadas, paprika-dusted poached octopus slices known as <em>pulpo a feira,</em> and stubby glasses of albariño. <em>Sidra</em> (cider) is the drink in the mountainous Asturias region, accompanied by a wedge of stinky Cabrales cheese and a link of chorizo braised in more cider. In their Basque incarnation tapas are called <em>pintxos</em> and are almost always mounted on bread—fanciful canapés decorated with frilly mayonnaise borders and arrayed on bar counters like edible communion dresses. Andalusian bars seduce with a vast array of edibles, from small portions of stews or snails in a spicy <a id="page_21"/>sauce, to fried fish and delicacies like poached hake roe in a piquant <em>aliño</em> (marinade).</p>
<p class="indent">Spain’s Mediterranean regions—Catalonia, Valencia, Alicante—don’t have a long tapas tradition. But this is where you find the best <em>bares de producto</em>: ingredient-driven lunch and dinner counters that offer <em>raciónes</em> or <em>media raciónes,</em> full or half portions. Few things in life are more pleasurable than staking a perch at one of the counters at Barcelona’s colorful Boqueria market and nibbling on flash-fired baby squid, as tiny as a pinky nail; just-picked fava beans with a fried egg on top; or the season’s first asparagus.</p>
<p class="indent">Even within one region, bars tend to specialize: Some excel in fried stuff, like <em>croquetas,</em> others in griddled or skewered bites, yet others in <em>montaditos</em> (canapés). Certain bars draw crowds with their inexpensive portions of marinated carrots or roasted peppers, others with seafood delicacies like langoustines or goose barnacles for prices as steep as those at Tokyo’s sushi bars. Some bars have menus, others have iron-lunged waiters who breathlessly recite the daily specials. Some lavishly display their wares on the counters; at other bars, each order emerges just-cooked from the kitchen. Wine bars and cheese bars, the breakfast bars of Seville and the beer bars of Madrid, bars out of central casting, and white neo-Moderne haunts with tapas artfully arranged in shot glasses, on skewers, and on spoons—at times, the entire country seems like one vast bar theme park.</p>

<p class="noindent">Here’s an enticing Moorish-inspired dish that I tasted in Alicante. It’s a great, simple way to jazz up a bowl of olives.

<h3 class="h3">SEVILLIAN MARINATED CARROTS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ZANAHORIAS ALIÑADAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Spanish tapas bars can become legendary among locals for even the humblest of things—a great potato omelet, extra-fat caper berries. Las Golondrinas, a crammed, tiled institution in Seville’s evocative Triana quarter, is a case in point. Its menu is varied, but the wall-to-wall crowds that gather there each evening all demand one thing: marinated carrots. Spiced in the Moorish manner with cumin and loads of garlic and swimming in a tangy puddle of lemon juice and aromatic olive oil, the carrot slices are indeed a treat. The bar also uses a similar <em>aliño</em> (marinade) for slices of cooked beets and roasted red peppers, <a id="page_24"/>and I invite you to follow its lead. Getting the actual recipe was out of the question; it’s zealously guarded. But while not as transporting as the original, my version comes pretty close.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 pound carrots (about 1½ inches in diameter), trimmed and scraped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 to 4 large garlic cloves, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ to 2 teaspoons cumin seeds</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons dried oregano</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pinch of crushed red pepper flakes</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, plus more for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup plus 1 teaspoon fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup fresh lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ tablespoons best-quality red wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the carrots in a large pot of boiling salted water and cook until crisp-tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the carrots and let cool just enough to handle, then cut them into ¼-inch slices.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> While the carrots are cooking, place the garlic, cumin, oregano, red pepper flakes, 1 tablespoon parsley, salt, and 1 teaspoon olive oil in a mortar and, using a pestle, mash them into a medium-fine paste. Whisk the lemon juice into the garlic paste.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place the carrot slices in a glass bowl while they are still warm and pour the garlic paste over them. Add the vinegar and the remaining ½ cup olive oil and toss to mix. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let marinate for at least 6 hours or refrigerate overnight. The carrots can be refrigerated for at least a week. Let the carrots come to room temperature before serving, place in a serving bowl, and garnish with parsley. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 8 TO 10 AS A LIGHT TAPA</strong></span></p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_23"/>SEVILLE TAPEO</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Sun-washed Moorish Seville, where Don Juan smirked and Carmen swirled, has always relished its role as the country’s sherry-soaked fun central and bar paradise. And if in other regions a tapa is something to nibble on with a drink before lunch or dinner, <em>sevillanos</em> tend to turn the <em>tapeo</em> into a meal. This makes perfect sense in the summer, when the city resembles a furnace and nobody wants to sit down to a big, filling dinner. Besides, what could beat getting together with friends to shuffle from one crowded bar to the next? You grab a bite and a beer at each place. You run into more friends on the way. Suddenly, the <em>tapeo</em> turns into a street party.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Maestros of the frying pan, Sevillians rank their <em>frituras</em> at the top of the tapas chain. Floured fried slices of eggplant; tiny <em>puntillitas</em> (baby squid) that one can inhale by the dozens; <em>cazón en adobo</em> (dogfish in a tangy marinade); <em>tortillitas de camarones</em> (crunchy shrimp pancakes)—all emerge from the bubbling olive oil greaseless and as light as lace. Also in demand are the traditional stews, made in an <em>olla madre</em> (mother pot) and then apportioned into mini <em>cazuelas</em>. These include spinach with chickpeas; plump, saucy meatballs; potatoes in saffron; and the ubiquitous oxtail stew, found especially at bars near the Maestranza bullring crowded with bullfighting fans. Among cold tapas, <em>papas aliñas</em> (marinated potatoes) reign supreme, followed by <em>mojama</em> (cured tuna), <em>chacinas</em> (smoky charcuterie), and the country’s tastiest olives and caper berries. And not to forget: the pitchers of coral-colored gazpacho that wait on bar counters during the summer; and <em>salmorejo,</em> gazpacho’s thicker, creamier cousin, which often doubles as a dip.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">My Seville lunchtime <em>tapeo</em> always centers on <em>calle</em> Gamazo, a narrow lane in the old city center, which has an improbable concentration of excellent bars. Here, hidden behind a century-old <em>ultramarino</em> (grocery store), is the spectacularly picturesque Casa Moreno, festooned with bullfighting paraphernalia and Holy Week posters of the virgin of Macarena, her doll-like face framed by a cascade of gaudy white lace. Wisecracking guys behind the long stainless-steel counter dispense dense, chewy smoked meats and warm, smoky chorizo sandwiches, slapping them onto pieces of waxed paper. Across the street, the macho bar Enrique Becerra beckons with mussels on toast, oxtail croquettes, and juicy mint-scented lamb meatballs. Next, I follow the <em>tapeadores</em> to the venerable pocket-size Casablanca, where the wall-to-wall crowd testifies to the excellence of its tapas-scaled seafood stews, extra-fluffy potato tortillas with whiskey sauce, and Seville’s definitive <em>papas aliñas,</em> which impressed even King Juan Carlos. The last stop is Bodeguita Romero, where plates come draped with translucent slices of smoked bacalao, bread heaped with sea urchin caviar, and caper berries as big and juicy as grapes. And I would never—never—think of leaving without an order, or two, of <em>pringá</em>:a kind of Andalusian sloppy joe consisting of the solids from a boiled dinner (blood sausage, chorizo, root vegetables) mashed up and pressed into warm bread, like a <em>panino</em>. Time for a long siesta—followed by an evening <em>tapeo</em> in the Triana quarter across the Guadalquivir river.</p>

<p class="box-title">SKEWERED!</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Bites impaled on a stick are the most ubiquitous and beloved kind of tapa. They are called <em>banderillas,</em> after the colorful darts employed in bullfighting. Skewers of briny, appetite-stimulating things are ideal companions to <em>aperitivos</em> and can be put together in minutes at home. Keep in mind that these tapas should be rather small, to be eaten all in one bite. Use the ideas below, or experiment at your whim.</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• A quartered artichoke heart, a cube of Roncal or Manchego cheese, and a cherry tomato</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• A chunk of canned tuna sandwiched between pieces of a small pickled cucumber</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• A cube of hard salami or chorizo, a pickled pearl onion, and a chunk of red bell pepper</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• A hard-cooked egg quarter dabbed with mayonnaise, a poached shrimp, and a rolled-up anchovy</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• A chunk of poached salmon, a piquillo pepper, and a cornichon</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• A chunk of roasted green pepper, a rolled-up <em>boqueròn</em> (white anchovy), a cube of potato, and a pimiento-stuffed olive</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• A cube of aged Manchego cheese and one of <em>membrillo</em> (quince paste), and a chunk of endive or radicchio</p>

<h3 class="h3g"><a id="page_26"/>GILDA BASQUE SKEWERS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>GILDA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">The Gilda is a Basque bar classic: a spicy, briny skewer with alternating bits of aromatic fragrant pickled guindilla chiles, olives, and anchovies. Along with a stubby glass of Txakolí, the slightly fizzy local white, nothing quite hits the spot quite like the Gilda.</p>
<p class="indent">Locals know this, and consume them by the dozen. Said to be invented at a San Sebastián bar, the Gilda was named after Rita Hayworth’s spicy performance in the 1946 film of the same name. The rest was history, and now Gildas are on practically every bar counter. Though not part of the classic recipe, squares of red bell pepper lend color and crunch. Serve Gildas with sherry or a light white wine, such as the Basque Txakolí or Portuguese Vinho Verde.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>24 manzanilla olives (pimiento-stuffed are fine)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 guindilla chiles (see <a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#ch02_note1">Note</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 best-quality oil-packed anchovy fillets, drained</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 red bell pepper squares (each about ¾ inch)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt">Thread an olive onto a skewer. Add a guindilla chile, then an anchovy folded in half or thirds, followed by a square of red pepper, finishing with another olive. Repeat with the rest of the skewers. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES 12 SKEWERS</strong></span></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="ch02_note1"/><span class="blue"><strong>NOTE:</strong></span> Mildly spicy Basque guindilla chiles have a complex fragrance and are definitely worth seeking out. They’re available at some specialty groceries and from mail-order sources—just Google “guindilla chiles.” Otherwise, look for slender Italian pickled pale-green chiles that are about 3 inches long.</p>

<h3 class="h3">SMOKY FRIED ALMONDS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ALMENDRAS FRITAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Roasted almonds are fine, but when the nuts are slowly fried in good olive oil they acquire a profoundly nutty character that is particularly Spanish. Tossed with sea salt and smoked paprika, they are practically addictive, especially if you use the fabulous marcona almonds. However, if you prefer to roast the nuts, spread them on a rimmed baking sheet and bake them in a 350°F oven for about 20 minutes, stirring them several times. Then toss them with the salt and paprika.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1½ cups blanched almonds, preferably marcona</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About ¾ cup extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ teaspoons coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon smoked sweet Spanish paprika</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_27"/><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Line a small baking sheet with paper towels. Place the nuts in an 8-inch skillet and add enough olive oil to come level with the almonds. Place the skillet over medium-high heat and heat until the oil begins to crackle gently. Reduce the heat to medium and continue cooking the nuts until they are light golden, about 5 minutes, stirring several times. Using a slotted spoon, remove the almonds from the oil and spread them on the paper towels to drain.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> While the almonds are still warm, place them in a brown paper bag or another heatproof bag and add the salt and paprika. Close the bag and shake it to evenly coat the nuts. Transfer the almonds to a bowl and serve at once. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES 1½ CUPS</strong></span></p>

<p class="box-title">TAPAS TIPPLES</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">What you’ll drink with your tapas depends on where in Spain your <em>tapeo</em> takes place. The custom of eating tapas originated in the sherry-producing area of Andalusia, so an ice-cold sip of fino or manzanilla (dry sherries) is a natural in these southern parts. In the Basque Country, the tipple is Txakolí, the slightly fizzy local white wine poured from arm’s length to aerate it. In Asturias, you will have tapas with hard apple cider. The refreshing young white called albariño is served in small ceramic cups in the region of Galicia. And your flute will be filled with sparkling cava in Catalonia.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Okay, now forget all I said.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">The most popular thing to drink with tapas all over Spain? A <em>caña,</em> meaning a small beer. In fact, my Andalusian friends insist that ordering sherry is a sure way to stand out as a foreigner. During a recent <em>tapeo</em> in the bars of Logroño, the capital of the wine-producing Rioja region, I was shocked to observe that beer orders outnumbered wine three to one. Considering that an average tapas bar crawl might involve some eight drinks, small glasses of beer make perfect sense in a country where getting slobbered in public is considered embarrassing. Splashed with some 7-Up or lemon soda, the <em>caña</em> becomes a <em>clara</em> (clear), or affectionately, a <em>clarita</em>, Spain’s beloved summer refresher.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Add the same soda to a glass of cheap red wine and you’ve got <em>tinto de verano</em> (summer red), a hot-weather tipple much more popular in Andalusia than sangria, which tends to be dismissed as a tourist drink. My own Spanish bar favorite, especially at the über-traditional Madrid <em>tabernas,</em> is <em>vermú de grifo</em> (vermouth on tap) cut with soda. And though traditions die hard, these days one sees a new breed of wine bar opening all over the country, with a sophisticated choice of new-style wines by the glass.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">For my <em>tapeos</em> at home, I usually avoid full-bodied new-wave reds, such as high-alcohol Priorats, and opt instead for lighter Rioja <em>crianzas</em> or rosés from Navarra. With seafood, a well-chilled albariño certainly hits the spot, as does the crisp Rueda white called verdejo or the festive, easy-drinking bubbly, <em>cava</em>. With predinner nibbles such as green olives, almonds, or anchovies, a fino or manzanilla is a natural.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Now about mixed drinks: Though the Spanish adore their <em>copas</em> and <em>cóctels</em>—especially the <em>cuba libre</em> (rum and Coke) and “gin tonic”—they have a strange habit of indulging in them after dinner, usually in glasses the size of a small chamber pot.</p>

<h3 class="h3g"><a id="page_28"/>BLACK OLIVE, ANCHOVY, AND CAPER SPREAD</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>GARUM</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">In ancient Rome, <em>garum</em> was a pungent all-purpose condiment made from fermented anchovies, not unlike present-day Asian fish sauce. In modern Catalonia, the name refers to a spread similar to the French tapenade made of olives, anchovies, capers, sometimes mashed egg yolks, and either olive oil or softened butter. This recipe, flavored with rum and a touch of mustard, is adapted from one served at the Hotel Ampurdan in Figueres. The hotel is legendary for its robust Catalan cooking and credited with naming this spread <em>garum.</em> Try to find olives that are pungent, but not vinegary and briny. The spread is delicious on toasted baguette rounds or slices of grilled country bread. It also makes a fine accompaniment to grilled meat, chicken, or fish.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>2 cups pitted black olives, such as niçoise (see <a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#ch02_note2">Note</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 anchovy fillets, chopped and mashed in a mortar or with a fork</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons drained capers</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large garlic clove, crushed with a garlic press</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large hard-cooked egg yolk, mashed with a fork</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons dark rum or brandy</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon Dijon mustard</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 tablespoons fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Grilled bread, toast, or breadsticks, for serving</strong></p>
<p class="indentt">Place the olives, anchovies, capers, garlic, egg yolk, rum, and mustard in a food processor and process in quick pulses to a medium-fine paste, scraping down the side of the bowl once or twice. Gradually add the olive oil, pulsing several times after each addition. Scrape the mixture into a bowl and let stand at room temperature for about 1 hour so that the flavors develop. Serve with grilled bread, toast, or breadsticks. The spread can be refrigerated, covered, for up to 2 weeks. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES ABOUT 1¾ CUPS</strong></span></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="ch02_note2"/><span class="blue"><strong>NOTE:</strong></span> If the only pitted olives you can find are Kalamatas, soak them briefly in cold water and use fewer capers and anchovies. To pit olives, place them in a plastic bag. Lay the bag on a flat surface, and crush them lightly with the flat side of a large knife, a mallet, or a heavy skillet. Then pick out and discard the pits.</p>

<h3 class="h3">CATALAN GUACAMOLE</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>GUACAMOLE A LA CATALANA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Barcelona might be as generously supplied with sushi joints as any other cosmopolitan city, but “fusion” cuisine of any kind is still regarded there with great suspicion. Witness the uproar that ensued when Juanito, the legendary proprietor of Bar Pinotxo in the Boqueria market, introduced a toasted canapé topped with an avocado spread on <a id="page_29"/>his menu. How could a place as iconically Catalan as Pinotxo dare to spread a tostada with a Mexican guacamole, the traditionalists cried out. Could this be the end of Catalan cuisine? None of it seemed to bother Juanito, who proudly plied regulars with his new concoction. Besides, his lemony avocado spread, bolstered with sherry vinegar, isn’t exactly guacamole. Juanito serves it on long slices of toasted bread, topped with fat anchovies and sprinkled with chopped, briny black olives.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>2 small garlic cloves, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 best-quality oil-packed anchovy fillets, drained and chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large pinch of coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>

<h3 class="h3g">ZUCCHINI, BELL PEPPER AND ONION JAM</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>PISTO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Every southern European culture has its own mixed vegetable spread: Provence has ratatouille, Sicily, caponata. In Spain, you find the Catalan <em>samfaina,</em> the Andalusian <em>alboronia,</em> and <em>pisto,</em> which is popular in the rest of the country, especially in La Mancha and the Basque Country. Similar to ratatouille but minus the eggplant, the flavor of <em>pisto</em> is sweeter because of the red bell peppers and onion. Serve it as a spread for bread or toast, a base for canapés, or with fried or poached eggs. The Basques use <em>pisto</em> in endless imaginative canapés made with everything from anchovies, to smoked salmon, to ham, to poached quail eggs.</p>

<h3 class="h3">TOASTED HAZELNUT ROMESCO DIP</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ROMESCO DE AVELLANAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">I can’t imagine a tapas bash without at least one dish accompanied by <em>romesco,</em> the famous pepper and nut sauce of the Catalan Tarragona province. In that region, one encounters dozens of variations on <em>romesco,</em> with ingredients that vary slightly, depending on how the sauce will be served. The version here—zesty with raw garlic, puckery with vinegar, and subtly spicy with dried chile—makes an ideal dip for crunchy green crudités, such as celery sticks, fennel sticks, or endive leaves. It is also delicious with grilled shrimp or poached or grilled asparagus, or simply smeared on a piece of grilled or toasted bread.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 medium-size dried ñora pepper or ancho chile, stemmed, seeded, and torn into small pieces</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅔ cup hazelnuts, toasted and skinned (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_267">page 267</a>; see <a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#ch02_note3">Note</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 large garlic cloves, peeled</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ tablespoons toasted bread crumbs</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small ripe plum tomato, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon sweet (not smoked) paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅛ teaspoon cayenne, or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 tablespoons fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons best-quality red wine vinegar, or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the ñora pepper in a small heatproof bowl, add ½ cup very hot water, and soak until softened, about 30 minutes. Drain, setting aside the soaking liquid.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the hazelnuts in a food processor and pulse until they are ground medium-fine. Add the ñora pepper, ⅓ cup of its soaking liquid, and the garlic, bread crumbs, tomato, paprika, and cayenne, and process until fairly smooth but still with some texture from the nuts. With the motor running, drizzle in the olive oil until it is completely incorporated.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Scrape the sauce into a bowl, stir in the vinegar, and season with salt to taste. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the sauce stand until the flavors meld, at least 30 minutes. Taste the sauce before serving, adding more vinegar and cayenne, if desired. The dip will keep, covered in the refrigerator, for up to 1 week. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES ABOUT 1½ CUPS</strong></span></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="ch02_note3"/><span class="blue"><strong>NOTE:</strong></span> To intensify the flavor of the hazelnuts, once they are toasted and skinned, you can fry them in 2 tablespoons olive oil until golden. Hazelnuts give a special character to the sauce, but fried almonds, or a mix of almonds and hazelnuts, are also delicious.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_31"/>BACALAO HASH</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>BACALAO AL AJO ARRIERO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">In the La Mancha region, cod <em>al ajo arriero</em>—or mule driver’s style—refers to a bacalao and potato puree not dissimilar to the French <em>bran-dade.</em> In the Basque Country, <em>ajo arriero</em> is prepared with flaked cod that’s slowly sautéed with onion, tomato, and peppers. It’s often spread on bread as one of the region’s favorite <em>pintxos</em> (tapas). At home, I mound it on bread or serve it as a chunky spread. Spooned on toast and topped with a poached egg, the hash also makes an excellent breakfast or brunch. This is one case where salt cod shouldn’t be replaced by fresh, as the dish needs that nice pungent kick. Start at least a day ahead to give the bacalao a chance to soak.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>6 ounces salt cod, soaked and cooked (see <a class="nounder" href="ch07.html#page_198">page 198</a>), then drained</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons fragrant extra-virgin olive oil, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size onion, finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 large garlic cloves, minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ large green bell pepper, cored, seeded, and diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 to 7 piquillo peppers (from a can or jar), or 3 large pimientos, cut into strips</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size Yukon Gold potatoes (about 6 ounces each), peeled, boiled, drained, and diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon sweet (not smoked) paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup tomato sauce</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon white wine vinegar or sherry vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Sliced crusty baguette, for serving</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Flake the salt cod finely, discarding the bones, skin, and any tough bits.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes. Add the green pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion and pepper are very soft, about 10 minutes, reducing the heat so they don’t brown. If the skillet looks dry, add a little more olive oil, then stir in the flaked salt cod, piquillo peppers, and potatoes. Stir to mix well, then cover the skillet and cook for 5 minutes, stirring once or twice.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Add the paprika and stir for a few seconds. Stir in the tomato sauce, reduce the heat to very low, re-cover the skillet, and simmer until all the flavors are melded, 8 to 10 minutes. The cod hash should be nicely moist; if it isn’t, add a little water and simmer for a few minutes longer. Stir in the vinegar and salt and black pepper to taste. Let the hash cool to warm or room temperature (the flavors will meld and develop further as it sits). Stir in the parsley and serve on or with bread. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6 TO 8 AS A TAPA</strong></span></p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>TOMATES RELLENOS DE BONITO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">The Cuchara de San Telmo tapas bar in San Sebastián is amazing. Its young chef/owners Iñaki Gulin and Alex Montiel have both worked at El Bulli, Ferran Adrià’s outrageously inventive restaurant. But instead of applying their credentials and skill to someplace haute, they decided to open a simple neighborhood haunt serving restaurant food—at bar prices. Nothing there costs more than a few dollars but ah, the food: caramelized foie gras ravioli, shot glasses of ethereal chilled crab soup topped with tomato jam, amazing boned pork ribs glazed with balsamic vinegar (see <a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_238">page 238</a> for my adaptation). Here is one of Iñaki and Alex’s simpler and most popular dishes, perfectly ripe skinned tomatoes filled with tuna mousse and presented in a bright-green puddle of parsley vinaigrette, with drizzles of aged balsamic vinegar. The chefs use <em>ventresca,</em> the prized tuna belly, for the filling, but good imported canned tuna will do just fine. The dish is as pretty as it is delicious, especially when served on an elegant white plate to show off the colors.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>8 smallish vine-ripened tomatoes (about 2¼ pounds total; do not use beefsteak or plum tomatoes)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup best-quality red wine vinegar, plus more for sprinkling over the tomatoes</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 ounces imported solid oil-packed tuna, or 2 cans (each 6 ounces) Bumble Bee tonno in olive oil, drained and flaked into chunks</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup light olive oil for the filling, plus ½ cup for the vinaigrette</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 packed cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves, plus 8 whole parsley leaves for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pinch of sugar, or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons syrupy aged balsamic vinegar, or ⅓ cup thin balsamic vinegar reduced over medium-high heat to 2 tablespoons</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Using a vegetable peeler, peel the tomatoes. Slice the tops off and trim the bottoms so that the tomatoes will stand upright on a plate. Using a grapefruit spoon or a small coring knife, scoop out the pulp from the tomatoes, leaving about ⅛ inch of the shell and reserving the pulp. Arrange the tomatoes on a pretty white serving plate and sprinkle salt and a little red wine vinegar on the insides.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Finely chop the pulp from 4 of the tomatoes, setting aside the remaining tomato pulp for another <a id="page_33"/>use. Place the chopped pulp in a small sieve to drain off excess moisture.</p>

<p class="uln1"><strong>8 to 9 ounces herbed goat cheese, at room temperature</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>14 to 16 whole piquillo peppers (from a can or jar), and 2 piquillo peppers finely chopped</strong></p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_34"/><span class="blue">PIQUILLO PEPPERS</span></p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Elegantly shaped, scarlet red, and supremely sweet with just a hint of heat and acidity, piquillo peppers are the caviar of capsicums. Fortunately, because these peppers are roasted, then packed flat in cans or in jars, piquillos travel perfectly well and can now be found at many American markets. In fact, piquillos prove that some preserved foods are indeed better than fresh. And once you discover them, there’s no going back to ordinary roasted peppers.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Piquillos are adorable looking: small and triangular, with a characteristic peak that gives them their name. Grown in the vegetable-rich Navarra region, like a fine wine they have been given a denomination of origin, with the appellation of Lodosa, a small Navarrese village around which they are grown. Piquillo peppers are hand picked when perfectly ripe, slowly roasted over beechwood, which imparts a light smokiness, and then packed in their own sweet juices. Because they lose much of their water content during roasting, their flavor is amazingly concentrated: What you get is the essence of pepper.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Though it might seem that piquillos have held their place in the Spanish repertoire forever, their mass production dates back only to the 1970s, when they were popularized by modern Basque chefs. Today, you’ll find them stuffed, baked, pureed, or sautéed at almost every Basque bar counter.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Kitchen uses for piquillo peppers are legion. Here are some of my favorites:</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• Eaten straight from the jar, perhaps with a sprinkling of good olive oil, sherry vinegar, a touch of garlic and parsley or basil, and a little coarse salt</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• Halved or quartered and tucked into grilled ham and cheese sandwiches</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• Julienned and seasoned with a simple vinaigrette to be used as a bed for mozzarella or goat cheese, grilled seafood, or white or brown anchovies</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• Slivered to decorate cream soups, stuffed eggs, or canapés</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• Served as a side dish, briefly baked or sautéed over very low heat with lots of sliced garlic and olive oil. As you cook them, shake the pan slightly so that the oil emulsifies with their juices</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• Diced or pureed and added to vinaigrettes</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• Sliced and used as a garnish for salads or folded into scrambled eggs</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• Pureed and added to a simple tomato sauce with a dash of vinegar and a pinch of sugar</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• Heated with a little cream and chicken stock for a quick sauce</p>
<p class="sb-indent1">Of course, piquillos are a natural for stuffing. Cold piquillos are delicious filled with a salad of good canned tuna, roasted tomatoes, and a little mayo, or with a seafood or chicken salad. Hot, they are classically stuffed with chopped seafood, flaked cooked fish, or sautéed ground pork or veal. The filling usually begins with a béchamel sauce. Salt cod <em>brandade</em> also makes a terrific stuffing. Hot stuffed piquillos can be fried in a simple egg batter and baked, or simply baked with a drizzle of olive oil and some sliced garlic or with a sauce of their own pureed flesh.</p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>PIMIENTO DE PIQUILLO RELLENOS DE CARNE</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Stuffed piquillo peppers are enjoyed all over Spain, but nowhere are they more lovingly prepared than in the Basque Country, Navarra, and La Rioja. In these regions, the classic version usually involves a stuffing of seafood or meat that’s been fluffed up with béchamel sauce. The filled peppers are fried briefly after being coated in a simple egg batter, then finished in a creamy sauce in the oven.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE PEPPERS:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 tablespoons light olive oil, plus more for frying the peppers</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size onion, finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size garlic cloves, minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 ounces ground veal</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size tomato, cut in half and grated on a box grater, skin discarded</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, plus more for flouring the peppers</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅔ cup whole milk</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>16 to 18 whole piquillo peppers (from a can or jar), drained</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 large eggs, beaten</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE SAUCE:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons light olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ medium-size white onion, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 medium-size garlic cloves, minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 piquillo peppers (from a can or jar), chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large tomato, cut in half and grated on a box grater, skin discarded</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons sweet (not smoked) paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pinch of hot paprika or cayenne</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅔ cup dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup chicken stock or broth or water, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons heavy (whipping) cream</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon best-quality red wine vinegar, or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small pinch of sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Finely minced fresh flat-leaf parsley or chives, for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Make the peppers: Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until completely softened but not browned, about 7 minutes. Add the veal, increase the heat to medium-high, and cook, mashing and breaking the meat up with a fork, until the veal is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato and cook, stirring, until the tomato is thickened and the pan juices are reduced, 5 to 7 minutes. Season the veal mixture with salt and black pepper to taste and set aside.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium-size saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the 2 tablespoons flour and stir for about 30 seconds to blend. Slowly pour in the milk, whisking constantly. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring, until the béchamel sauce thickens, 3 to 5 minutes. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to <a id="page_36"/>taste, then stir it into the veal mixture until thoroughly combined. Set the filling aside until cool enough to handle.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Stuff the piquillo peppers with the veal mixture; they should be quite full, but don’t let the filling leak out from the ends of the peppers. Arrange the stuffed peppers on a plate, cover them loosely with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until the filling becomes firm, at least 2 hours or up to 24.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Spread flour on a large plate, place the eggs in a shallow bowl, and line a baking sheet with paper towels. Pour olive oil to a depth of ½ inch in a large skillet and heat it over medium-high heat until a little beaten egg dropped in it sizzles on contact. Roll a few stuffed peppers in the flour, shaking off the excess, then dip them in the egg, again shaking off the excess. Add the battered peppers to the hot oil and cook until golden, about 2 minutes per side. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried peppers to the paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining stuffed peppers, adjusting the heat so that the oil doesn’t burn. The peppers can be prepared a day ahead up to this point and refrigerated, covered.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Make the sauce: Heat the olive oil in a medium-size skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add the chopped piquillo peppers and the tomato and cook, stirring, until the tomato is thickened and reduced, about 7 minutes, reducing the heat if necessary. Add the sweet and hot paprikas, stir for a few seconds, then add the wine and the chicken stock. Cook the sauce to reduce it slightly, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the cream and cook until heated through, about 1 minute. Let the sauce cool for a few minutes, then puree it in a blender until smooth. Scrape the sauce into a bowl, stir in the vinegar to taste and the sugar, and season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste. If the sauce seems too thick, dilute it with a little stock or water.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> To finish preparing the peppers, preheat the oven to 425°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">7.</span></strong> Spread half of the tomato sauce in a baking dish that can hold the peppers in one snug layer. Arrange the peppers on top and spread the remaining sauce over them. Bake the peppers and sauce until they are very hot, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for about 5 minutes. Serve garnished with parsley. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 8 AS A TAPA, 4 TO 6 AS A LIGHT MAIN COURSE</strong></span></p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="blue"><strong>VARIATIONS:</strong></span> Frying the piquillo peppers is traditional, but you can omit this step: Brush the stuffed peppers with oil and bake them in the tomato sauce. The recipe can be prepared ahead, in stages. Bake the peppers right before you are ready to serve.</p>
<p class="indent">While I’ve chosen a veal filling here, the dish is just as often prepared with salt cod or seafood. To make it that way, substitute 12 to 14 ounces seafood (flaked crab, finely chopped shrimp, chopped fresh fish, or a mixture), or presoaked poached, flaked salt cod for the veal. Cook the seafood briefly in the olive oil, then mix with the béchamel as described in Step 2.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_37"/>BEET LEAVES STUFFED WITH MORCILLA</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>HOJAS DE REMOLACHA RELLENAS CON MORCILLA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">At the Michelin three-star restaurant Arzak in San Sebastián, every <em>amuse-guele</em> arrives looking like a prettily wrapped gift. And although it’s the height of bad manners to ask for seconds of a giveaway appetizer, the beet leaves stuffed with blood sausage and apples were so incredible I swallowed my pride, took a deep breath, and begged for more. The good news? The recipe turned out to be simple enough to reproduce at home. At Arzak, the beet leaf packages are served upright on a plate, accompanied by a silver spoon of tangy grapefruit vinaigrette to cleanse the palate. At home, you can serve them in a less showy way, arranging them flat on plates and spooning the grapefruit on the side. Even those who might feel unsure about blood sausage will be dazzled by it in this dish, with its sweet and tart counterpoint of apples and citrus. Feel free to use red chard leaves instead of beet leaves for the wrappers.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE VINAIGRETTE:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size pink grapefruit</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons honey</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons cider vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 to 7 tablespoons light, flavorless oil, such as sunflower oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE STUFFED BEET LEAVES:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 ounces fully cooked blood sausage, such as Spanish morcilla without rice or boudin noir</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 to 3 tablespoons unsalted butter</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored, and grated</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 large beet leaves, stemmed, tough center vein trimmed</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Make the vinaigrette: Peel the grapefruit, making sure to remove all the bitter white pith. Finely chop the grapefruit, then place it and the honey in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook until some of the juice evaporates, about 5 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and gradually whisk in the oil. Set the vinaigrette aside.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Make the stuffed beet leaves: Remove and discard the casings from the blood sausage and chop the meat finely. Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium-size skillet over medium heat. Add the apple and cook, stirring, until slightly softened, about 3 minutes (add more butter if the skillet looks dry). Add the blood sausage and salt and pepper to taste and cook, stirring, for 3 to 5 minutes. Cover the skillet and cook until the flavors blend, 3 to 4 minutes more.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Working in batches, steam the beet leaves in a large wide steamer set over boiling water until tender, about 1½ minutes. (Alternatively, the leaves can be blanched in boiling water for about 45 seconds and refreshed under cold running water.) Arrange the leaves flat in one layer on paper towels and blot off the excess moisture with another paper towel.</p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_38"/><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Place a spoonful of morcilla filling on the bottom third of a beet leaf, fold in the sides and the bottom of the leaf, and roll the leaf up spring roll fashion.

<h3 class="h3g">TUNA-STUFFED EGGS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>HUEVOS RELLENOS DE ATUN</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">My Sevillian friend Lupe doesn’t cook much, claiming that the hot climate isn’t conducive to kitchen experiments. But she does have one passion: stuffed eggs—“the perfect light supper for a hot night,” she insists. Lupe can make stuffed eggs a dozen different ways: with <em>jamón,</em> tuna, smoked salmon, anchovies, or sautéed mushrooms; spiked with capers and shallots; or with a red-hued filling of minced piquillo peppers. When she really wants to make a show of it, she covers her creations with a layer of mayonnaise and elaborate sprinkles of grated hard-cooked eggs. This is one of her recipes, sure to please anyone in need of a break from plain deviled eggs. The better quality the tuna and anchovies, the tastier the eggs.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>6 large hard-cooked eggs, peeled and cut in half lengthwise</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 tablespoons imported solid oil-packed tuna or Bumble Bee tonno in olive oil, drained and finely flaked</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons drained small capers, or 2 tablespoons chopped pimiento-stuffed olives</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 best-quality oil-packed anchovy fillets, drained</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Thin strips of piquillo peppers (from a can or jar), or roasted peppers</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Minced fresh flat-leaf parsley, for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the egg yolks in a bowl and mash them well. Add the tuna, mayonnaise, lemon juice, and capers and stir to mix thoroughly. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Spoon the yolk mixture into the egg whites, spreading it slightly beyond the center hole (you may have more filling than you need). Loosely roll up an anchovy fillet, top a stuffed egg half with it, and tuck a piquillo pepper strip in the middle of the anchovy. Repeat with the remaining filled egg whites. Sprinkle parsley on top of the eggs and serve. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES 12</strong></span></p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>BROCHETAS DE GAMBA CON VINAGRETA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">You know you are at a Basque tapas bar when you see seafood—pickled anchovies, mussels, shrimp—flourished with a colorful vinaigrette of diced green and red peppers, white onion, flavorful white wine vinegar, and mild olive oil. So festive, so delicious. Versatile, too. Try this Basque vinaigrette on chunks of good canned tuna, Basic Marinated Sardines (<a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_53">page 53</a>), the white anchovies called <em>boquerones,</em> warm seared scallops, or steamed shelled mussels.</p>
<p class="indent">These shrimp brochettes are the specialty at Goiz Argi, a perpetually packed bar in San Sebastián’s cobblestoned Parte Vieja. Like any proper <em>pintxo</em> (Basque tapa), the brochettes are served on pieces of bread, but since my house isn’t a <em>pintxo</em> bar, I skip the starch. You can also poach the shrimp, thread them on skewers, spoon vinaigrette over them, and let them marinate lightly in the refrigerator for about two hours. The poached version doesn’t use bacon.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE BASQUE VINAIGRETTE:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup minced red bell pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup finely minced green bell pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup minced white onion</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size garlic clove, minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup light olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons best-quality white wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE SHRIMP:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon olive oil, plus more for brushing the shrimp</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 slices best-quality bacon</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>24 large shrimp, peeled and deveined, tails left on Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Make the Basque Vinaigrette: Place the red and green peppers, onion, garlic, olive oil, and vinegar in a bowl and stir to mix. Let stand for 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Prepare the shrimp: Heat the olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until it is crisp and has rendered its fat, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain the bacon on paper towels. When cool enough to handle, finely crumble the bacon.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Soak 6 bamboo skewers in water for 30 minutes. Light the grill and preheat it to medium-high, or preheat the broiler.</p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_40"/>SAN SEBASTIAN TAPEO</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Standing at a tapas bar in the belle époque Basque resort of San Sebastián, I sometimes I feel as if I’ve fallen down a rabbit hole and emerged in some Epicurean Wonderland. Here’s a platter laden with foie gras canapés drizzled with a sweet-tangy reduction of sherry vinegar. There’s a tray of silvery anchovies decorated with a Technicolor vinaigrette of diced peppers. Beyond, a vast mound of porcini and chanterelle mushrooms exudes an expensive bosky perfume. In the impenetrable Basque tongue, the <em>tapeo</em> is called <em>txikiteo</em> (from <em>txikito</em>, a small tot of wine) and revolves around <em>pintxos</em> (small bites) and <em>zuritos</em> (small beers) or stubby glasses of Txakolí, the slightly <em>pétillant</em> local white wine. A glass, a nibble, a schmooze, then on to the next bar, comparing the merits of this rockfish mousse to that bacalao-stuffed piquillo pepper along the way. The food-obsessed Basques indulge in this ritual daily.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">In their classic form, <em>pintxos</em> were simple morsels: a wedge of potato omelet or fried bacalao arranged on bread or a tangy, briny skewer called a Gilda. In the 1980s, however, bar owners began updating their brochettes and canapés with boutique ingredients, decorating them as if they were Fabergé eggs. Today, San Sebastián is known for the country’s most creative small bites. Aloña Berri, in the bourgeois barrio of Gros, is a bar that pioneered the gourmet <em>pintxo</em>. Its small plates degustation menu leaves you wondering how it’s possible for a plain neighborhood joint to serve food that belongs at a Michelin-starred restaurant. Like the killingly elegant dish composed of a spoon of grilled eggplant puree topped by an ethereal yogurt mousse, drizzled with aged balsamic vinegar, and paired with a shot glass of irides-cent-green pea soup. “Modern Basque <em>pintxo</em> is the baroque apotheosis of tapa,” a local food writer told me.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Though most counter displays at San Sebastián bars are almost pornographically lush, local gourmands insist that each bar excels only in particular items. In the moody, cobblestoned Parte Vieja (Old Town), Bar Martínez is renowned for its zucchini timbales stuffed with crab mousse, Bar Txepetxa is a tiny shrine to the anchovy, and Asador Ganbara specializes in wild mushroom dishes and smoky <em>jamón</em> stuffed into flaky mini croissants. Just down the road, but worlds away, is La Cuchara de San Telmo, where two young veterans of Ferran Adrià’s El Bulli dish out innovative small plates that would dazzle even the most jaded food critics in New York or London. It’s amazing what one can eat here for two dollars: caramelized foie gras ravioli; luxurious chilled crab soup dabbed with tomato marmalade; stupendous balsamic-glazed pork ribs, slow cooked, deboned, molded, and then flash grilled in a process that takes two days. La Cuchara, which advertises itself as a humble neighborhood bar, goes through at least 1,000 pounds of foie gras a year. Only in San Sebastián!</p>

On a whim, Quim, the young owner, layers and drizzles, composing fanciful <em>montaditos</em> (canapés mounted on rusks) that never fail to amuse and surprise. One of his creations is these stacks of eggplant, anchovies, and shaved cheese, with unexpected sweet accents of Quim’s famous tomato jam and syrupy aged balsamic vinegar.

<h3 class="h3">POTATO TOWERS WITH TUNA AND OLIVES</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>DELICIAS DE PATATAS, ATUN, Y ACEITUNAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">At Basque bars, when spicy, briny things aren’t skewered, they are usually stacked into decorative towers held together with toothpicks. Bathed in a mild vinaigrette and fancifully arranged on big plates, these variations on the theme of anchovies, tuna, and olives are just what the doctor ordered to stimulate the appetite and soften the effects of alcohol. You can play with this recipe, substituting tomato slices for potatoes as a base or adding poached shrimp to the towers instead of, or in addition to, the anchovies. If you can’t find piquillo peppers, omit them or use pimientos. These make a perfect starter to an alfresco summer luncheon.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>3 all-purpose boiling potatoes, unpeeled</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 large hard-cooked eggs, sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 to 7 piquillo peppers (from a can or jar), or 3 to 4 roasted pimientos, each cut into 3 wedges</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 ounces imported solid oil-packed tuna, or 2 cans (each 6 ounces) Bumble Bee tonno in olive oil, drained and broken into 1-inch chunks</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>18 to 20 best-quality oil-packed anchovy fillets, drained</strong></p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_44"/><span class="blue">ALLIOLI!</span></p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Catalans are convinced that everything tastes better with <em>allioli</em>, the potent garlic mayonnaise that enlivens dozens of dishes, from paellas to shellfish to fritters to boiled potatoes to grills. And who can disagree? Dating back to ancient Rome—Pliny the Elder mentions a similar sauce in the first century <span class="smallcaps">A.D</span>.—<em>allioli</em> takes its name from the words <em>all</em> (garlic), and <em>oli</em> (oil). Unlike Provençal <em>aioli,</em> a true Catalan <em>allioli</em> is made without eggs or lemon juice, the oil painstakingly whisked, drop by drop, into a paste of mortar-pounded garlic. Handmade <em>allioli</em> tends to be rather thick, with a glossy sheen and enough garlic to ward off an army of vampires. Such patience and skill are required to emulsify the sauce the old-fashioned way that these days even the staunchest traditionalists are embracing the egg-and-blender method. To temper the garlic’s bite, modern chefs often blanch it, roast it, or sauté it in olive oil.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Some traditional <em>allioli</em> recipes contain honey, apples, or quince; when it comes to creative renderings, the sky’s the limit. My friend Mari Carmen Velez from La Sirena restaurant in Alicante—a region where the sauce is much loved—is renowned for her new-wave <em>alliolis</em> spiked with passionfruit, raspberries, blood orange, almonds, seaweed, coffee, tea, avocado—even chocolate! Below you will find the classic blender version, plus a few fun variations.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">One cup of <em>allioli</em> is enough for most recipes in this book. For dishes where you need more, I offer an alternative recipe, as the proportions and method vary slightly for larger amounts. <em>Allioli</em> takes no time to prepare, but if you don’t have the ingredients or are unsure about using raw egg yolks, Mock Allioli prepared with store-bought mayonnaise is a good simple solution. All the <em>alliolis</em> should stand for a bit before serving—some for at least an hour, some for two hours. They all taste better if allowed to rest overnight, covered, in the refrigerator, and will keep that way for up to 3 days.</p>
<h3 class="h3a">BASIC ONE-CUP ALLIOLI</h3>
<p class="uln1"><strong>⅔ cup extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup peanut or canola oil</strong></p>

<p class="uln"><strong>2 large egg yolks</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 teaspoons fresh lemon juice, or to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Stir together both oils in a measuring cup with a spout. Place the garlic, egg yolks, and lemon juice in a blender and pulse until a coarse paste forms. With the motor running, add the oil in a slow, thin, steady stream. The mixture will be the consistency of a thick mayonnaise. Scrape the <em>allioli</em> into a bowl, and season with salt to taste, and more lemon juice, if desired. Let stand for at least 1 hour before serving, or cover and refrigerate if keeping longer. If the <em>allioli</em> seems too thick, thin it out with a little water before using. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES JUST OVER 1 CUP</strong></span></p>

<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">In a country where it’s presently de rigueur for young chefs to collaborate with scientists and where the word <em>deconstruction</em> is uttered by chefs as routinely as it was at philosopher Jacques Derrida’s graduate seminars, the verb <em>tapear</em> can be stretched quite far. Recently I got a taste of a truly futuristic <em>tapeo</em> while attending a cocktail party in Barcelona, given by the high priest of avant-garde cooking, Ferran Adrià.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">In a scene out of a sci-fi flick, a blond assistant enveloped in clouds of hissing-cold vapors was immersing balls of pistachio paste in a cauldron of liquid nitrogen, a freezing agent that chills food in an instant. The Martian “Popsicles” emerged frozen solid on the outside and liquid inside. Across the room was a demonstration of “spherification.” One of Adrià’s favorite techniques, it involves liquid—fruit juice, vegetable puree—mixed with alginate (a kelp extract), then dropped into calcium chloride to form a delicate skin. I was handed a yellow ball on a porcelain spoon. It looked like an egg yolk and tasted like mango.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">At another station, chefs used blowtorches to mold thin squares of caramel colored with gold powder around quail eggs. All around me, guests were gasping and gawking at Adrià’s magic tricks posing as finger food: miniature loaf pans of frozen “air” flavored with Parmesan, gossamer cones filled with trout eggs and soy gelée. To drink? Hot-and-cold daiquiris and a glass of “spherified” beads with rum, coconut milk, pineapple, and cotton candy (a deconstructed piña colada).</p>
<p class="sb-indent">“The tapa has come a long way since its original state: a morsel that came on or with bread and was eaten out of hand standing up,” explains José Carlos Capel, Spain’s top restaurant critic. “First you dropped the bread, then you started eating tapas sitting down with a knife and fork. Suddenly high-minded chefs started abandoning normal portions in favor of degustation menus of tapas-scaled bites.” Adrià’s progressions of thirty-plus tiny tastes at El Bulli sparked the small-plates revolution back in the ’90s. In a culture already hooked on grazing, the trend spread like wildfire.</p>

<h3 class="h3g">MOORISH KEBABS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>PINCHOS MORUNOS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">This tapa, found at bars all over Spain, is often singled out as an exemplary fusion dish: a Moorish (<em>moruno</em>) marinade applied to pork, the quintessentially Spanish meat that no Muslim would touch. Though it’s romantic to think that the dish goes back to medieval Arab-Spanish culinary roots, more likely the idea for these brochettes was borrowed from North African immigrants. Either way, the kebabs are wonderful, and taste equally good made with pork, chicken, or lamb. At some bars, the seasoning is as simple as garlic and hot and sweet paprika; others use a more elaborate marinade that includes many spices. Because the marinade gives the meat so much zest, these <em>pinchos</em> are usually presented rather straightforwardly, without sauce. However, if you’d like to experiment with different combinations, serve the brochettes with Tangy Cilantro Mojo (<a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_235">page 235</a>) or with Colorful Saffron Allioli (<a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_45">page 45</a>).

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>GAMBAS AL AJILLO</strong></small></p>
<p class="image"><a id="page_48"/><img alt="Image" src="../images/p0048_01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="caption"><strong>Sizzling Garlic Shrimp</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">There is a century-old tapas bar in Madrid called La Casa del Abuelo, a dim, minuscule place that serves sickly sweet jug wine and little else besides shrimp <em>a la plancha</em> and the house specialty—garlic shrimp. Sizzled slowly and patiently in small earthenware <em>cazuelas</em> while customers watch, the garlic shrimp offer a textbook example of how this classic tapa should taste. The Atlantic shrimp are ultrafresh and small, as they should be, and simmered so gently in olive oil that they come out just heated through rather than fried. The oil is of excellent quality, plentiful, and so suffused with garlic that people huddle around the bar dunking bread in what’s left long after the shrimp are gone.</p>
<p class="indent">Even in less perfect renditions these garlicky shrimp are easy to love, making them one of Spain’s most popular tapas. The secret to success is very fragrant olive oil that is not too heavy in texture, and a cooking vessel that conducts heat slowly and can be presented at the table so diners can dip in their bread. A <em>cazuela</em> is ideal, but you can also use an attractive, deep cast-enamel skillet. If by some rare chance you have any of the garlicky oil left over, toss it with pasta the next day.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1¼ pounds small shrimp, peeled and deveined</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 large garlic cloves, finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ small dry red chile, such as arbol, crumbled</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 to 3 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Country bread, for serving</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Pat the shrimp dry with paper towels, then sprinkle salt over them.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the olive oil and garlic in a 10- to 11-inch earthenware <em>cazuela</em> and heat over medium-low heat until the oil shimmers and the garlic begins to sizzle gently. Cook until the garlic is very fragrant but not colored, 2 to 3 minutes, reducing the heat if necessary. Add the chile and stir for a few seconds. Add the shrimp and cook, stirring, until they just begin to turn pink, about 3 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Season with salt to taste, stir in the parsley, and cook for a few seconds longer. Serve the shrimp in the <em>cazuela</em> with plenty of bread alongside. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4 OR 5 AS A TAPA, 2 OR 3 AS A LIGHT MAIN COURSE</strong></span></p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="blue"><strong>VARIATIONS:</strong></span> This dish can be made with large shrimp, in which case I like to cook them in their shells to preserve their texture. You can also prepare mushrooms, clams, or small pieces of chicken the same way.</p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>MEJILLONES CON CHORIZO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">While in America the pairing of shellfish and sausage represents a vision of Spanish cuisine, the combination is actually more typical of Portuguese cooking. Yet chorizo and mussels make such a delicious and easy crowd-pleasing tapa, I felt it would be a crime to pass it up. Serve the mussels in an earthenware <em>cazuela</em> as a tapa with plenty of bread for mopping up the sauce, or try them over spaghetti (see <a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#ch02_var1">Variation</a>).</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 to 7 ounces sweet Spanish-style chorizo sausage, cut in half lengthwise, then into medium-thin slices</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 medium-size garlic cloves, sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ cups chopped canned tomatoes</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ small dried red chile, such as arbol, crumbled</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 cups Shrimp Shell Stock (<a class="nounder" href="ch11.html#page_356">page 356</a>), or 1¼ cups clam juice diluted with ¾cup water</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size pinch of saffron, pulverized in a mortar and steeped in 2 tablespoons very hot water</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon best-quality red wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size pinch of sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 pounds mussels, scrubbed well and debearded right before using</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup minced fresh flat-leaf parsley, for garnish Country bread, for serving</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a wide, heavy pot over medium heat. Add the chorizo and cook, stirring, until lightly browned and beginning to crisp, 4 to 5 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the chorizo to a bowl.

<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Spoon off all but 1 tablespoon of the oil from the pot, then add the tomatoes and the chile. Cook over medium-low heat until the tomatoes are well-reduced and lightly caramelized, about 7 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the shrimp stock, increase the heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, add the saffron, and simmer, covered, to blend the flavors, about 10 minutes. Add the vinegar, sugar, and salt to taste.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Add the mussels to the pot, cover, and cook over medium-high heat, shaking the pot occasionally, until the mussels open, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove and discard any of the mussels that don’t open. Stir in the reserved chorizo and garlic. Transfer the mussels to an earthenware <em>cazuela</em> or another rustic serving dish, sprinkle with the parsley, and serve with slices of country bread. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4 TO 6 AS A TAPA</strong></span></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="ch02_var1"/><span class="blue"><strong>VARIATION:</strong></span> If you’d like to serve the mussels with pasta, increase the amount of olive oil to 4 tablespoons and don’t drain it off; decrease the amount of shrimp stock to 1½ cups.

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>CHORIZO A LA SIDRA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Along with <em>fabada</em> (the heroic bean and pork casserole), chorizo braised in hard cider pretty much defines the cuisine of the rugged, mountainous Asturias region. At good country taverns—in Asturias these are called <em>chigres</em>—the chorizo is likely to be made in house, as is the cider. After a good hike in the mountains, there is nothing I’d rather eat. Asturian cider is fermented, which renders it pretty acidic. If you can’t find hard cider at a good liquor or specialty store, use beer with a dash of apple juice. The chorizo is also delicious braised in <em>cava,</em> dry sherry, or red wine, and you can prepare pork sausage this way as well.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 pound sweet Spanish-style chorizo sausage</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About 1 cup dry hard cider</strong></p>

<p class="indentt">Prick the chorizo all over with the tines of a fork. Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a deep skillet that can hold the chorizo snugly. Add the chorizo and lightly brown them all over, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain off all the fat from the skillet. Add enough cider to come about halfway up the chorizo and bring to a boil. Add the bay leaf, reduce the heat to low, and simmer, covered, turning the chorizo several times, until they are cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Cut the chorizo into thick slices and serve with plenty of bread. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6 TO 8 AS A TAPA</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3">BASIC MARINATED SARDINES</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>SARDINAS ALIÑADAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Silvery marinated sardines are one of the great pleasures of eating in Spain. And they are extremely easy to prepare at home, provided you know where to get very fresh ones. If your fishmonger is an affable type, ask him to clean and bone the sardines for you. Otherwise, it isn’t hard to do at home; you’ll find instructions below. Essentially a form of ceviche, the fresh sardines marinate in vinegar until they turn opaque and are “cooked” by the acid. Then, they can be served with nothing more than a sprinkling of minced flat-leaf parsley and garlic or with the colorful Basque Vinaigrette (Step 1, <a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_39">page 39</a>). You can make a raspberry vinaigrette, another intriguing dressing, by pureeing a cup of raspberries in a blender with a quarter cup of red wine vinegar and straining it through a sieve. I often serve the sardines on thin slices of sourdough toast, with a few arugula leaves and thinly sliced figs. They’re also great with grapes and balsamic vinegar ice cream (see <a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_55">page 55</a>).</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>6 medium-size (each 3 to 4 ounces) very fresh sardines</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About ¾ cup white wine vinegar (see <a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#ch02_note4">Note</a>), or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About ⅓ cup fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> To clean and bone the sardines, remove the scales from the fish by gently scraping them with a small dull knife under cold running water. Cut off and discard the heads, then, using a small sharp knife, carefully make a slit along the bellies. Gut and clean the fish under cold running water. Grab on to the top of the spine of a sardine and pull it out quickly, trying not to remove too much of the flesh around it. Repeat with the remaining sardines. Cut each sardine in half to make two fillets and, if you feel small bones, trim the sides of the fillets. Rinse the fillets under cold running water and pat them dry with paper towels.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Arrange the sardine fillets skin side down in one layer in a shallow glass dish and add enough vinegar to cover them. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and let the sardines marinate in the refrigerator until they turn white, 6 to 8 hours depending on their size, turning them several times. Drain off the vinegar and pour the olive oil over the fillets. Let them come to room temperature before serving. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES 12 FILLETS</strong></span></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="ch02_note4"/><span class="blue"><strong>NOTE:</strong></span> In Spain, a mild, flavorful white wine vinegar is usually used to marinate fish. If your vinegar seems too strong, dilute it with a little water or use rice vinegar or lemon juice instead.</p>

<h3 class="h3">SARDINES WITH BALSAMIC VINEGAR ICE CREAM</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>SARDINAS CON HELADO DE VINAGRE DE MODENA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">A sprightly salad of green grapes and a small scoop of sweet-tart vinegar ice cream to cleanse the palate make a sensational counterpoint to the rich, buttery flesh of marinated sardines. This memorable combination of flavors was inspired by a dish at Hisop restaurant in Barcelona, where it’s made with sparkling fresh <em>caballa</em> (mackerel) that is marinated briefly in olive oil. It works beautifully with sardines as well, and you can also try it with thin slices of fatty sashimi-quality tuna or tuna tartare. (Fish that’s good enough to be eaten raw doesn’t need to marinate in the lemon juice; all it requires is a drizzle of good olive oil and a sprinkling of coarse sea salt.) The chefs at Hisop make their own vinegar ice cream, but doctoring store-bought vanilla is a cool, easy option (the dish is also delicious without the ice cream). The fish in the Basic Marinated Sardines recipe needs to marinate for six to eight hours, so plan accordingly.</p>
<p class="uln1"><a id="page_56"/><strong>1 cup green seedless grapes, sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, or more if the grapes are very sweet</strong></p>

<h3 class="h3">SALMON WITH SALMON ROE AND VANILLA OIL</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>SALMON A BAJA TEMPERATURA CON HUEVOS DE SALMON Y ACEITE DE VAINILLA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">This dish is a knockout, a truly inspired juggling of three distinctive flavors. What’s key here is the salmon’s texture—extraordinarily silky and almost creamy, achieved by cooking the fish on a plastic-wrapped plate in a very low oven (a home simulation of <em>sous vide,</em> or vacuum-packed cooking). Carles Abellan, the progressive Barcelona chef who created the dish, poaches his salmon with oil before cooking. The method here (suggested by New York chef David Bouley) achieves the same texture without the oil. The resulting fish retains the bright pink color of raw salmon but is cooked through. (Don’t worry about putting plastic wrap in the oven—at such a low temperature, it shouldn’t burst or melt.) Combined with drizzles of vanilla-infused oil and juicy salmon eggs, the dish is as impressive as any fancy three-star restaurant appetizer. The vanilla oil can become habit-forming. Use it to add an intriguing dimension of flavor to such sweet shellfish as crab, lobster, scallops, or shrimp. And it’s delicious stirred into mashed potatoes.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE VANILLA OIL:</strong></p>

<h3 class="h3g">MACKEREL IN QUICK ESCABECHE</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>CABALLA EN ESCABECHE</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Here’s chef Ferran Adrià’s delicious quick take on the classic Spanish dish <em>escabeche.</em> Though classic <em>escabeches</em> normally marinate for many hours, this fish is good to eat right away. Serve plenty of bread to sop up the tasty marinade. And feel free to try the recipe with other oily fish, such as bluefish or sardines.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>4 Spanish mackerel fillets (each about 8 ounces), each cut in half crosswise</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>All-purpose flour, for dusting the fish</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 thick asparagus stalks, trimmed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 medium-size garlic cloves, peeled and lightly crushed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 jar (6½ ounces) marinated artichokes, drained</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 bay leaves</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ teaspoon smoked sweet Spanish paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup sherry vinegar, preferably aged</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Country bread, for serving</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Season the fish with salt and pepper and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes. Dust the fish very lightly with flour, shaking off the excess.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the fish and cook, turning once, until brown and crisp, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer the fish to a deep platter and pour off the oil from the skillet.</p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_59"/><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Add the remaining 6 tablespoons olive oil to the skillet and heat over medium heat for a few seconds. Add the asparagus, garlic, artichokes, and bay leaves and cook until the asparagus is golden and just tender, 5 to 6 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Remove the skillet from the heat, add the paprika and vinegar, and pour the vegetable mixture over the fish. The fish will be ready to serve after about 15 minutes; for a more pickled taste, it can be marinated longer, anywhere from 2 to 24 hours. Refrigerate the fish if marinating it longer than 2 hours and let come to room temperature before serving the fish with country bread. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6 TO 8</strong></span></p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_58"/>SHERRY</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Banish the image of that dusty bottle of cream sherry in your grandmother’s cupboard. Good dry sherry—<em>Jerez</em> in Spanish—is one of the world’s sexiest drinks, an ideal companion to tapas. The wine is named after the town of Jerez de la Frontera, where most of it is produced and where viticulture has flourished since the time of Phoenicians in the twelfth century <span class="smallcaps">B.C</span>. The sherry grapes, predominantly Palomino, as well as the sweet Pedro Ximénez, grow in the area’s unique chalky soil called <em>albariza,</em> which soaks up winter rain like a sponge, and feeds the deep, craggy roots of the vines throughout the hot, arid summers. After the grapes are picked, crushed, and fortified with grape spirits, the liquid is placed in wooden casks, where the wine may develop a characteristic covering of yeast called flor (flower) on its surface. Flor intensifies the wine’s flavor, keeping it crisp and dry. Sherry that develops flor will be labeled fino; sherry that doesn’t will be left to oxidize and will be sold as oloroso. Next, the sherry undergoes a complex maturing and blending process known as the solera, in which some of it is blended at regular intervals with wine from an older barrel and then topped up with a younger wine. This ensures consistency and leaves consumers free from having to worry about particular vintages. Bottled sherry comes in the following categories:</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><strong>FINO</strong> (meaning “fine”) is light, dry, straw-colored, and delicate. It’s usually fortified to about 15 percent alcohol. (Pale cream sherry is a sweetened fino.)</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><strong>MANZANILLA</strong> is the incomparable fino-style sherry produced in the picturesque seaside town of Sanlúcar de Barrameda, which has an Atlantic microclimate believed to lend manzanilla its irresistible crisp-dry salty tang.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><strong>AMONTILLADO,</strong> another member of the fino family, is aged longer in the solera system and left to oxidize after it loses its flor, which accounts for its amber color, deep nuttiness, and brassy richness. Amontillado, which should really be enjoyed dry, is often sweetened for export. Its alcohol content is higher than that of a fino.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><strong>OLOROSO</strong> (meaning “fragrant”) is a dark amber, wonderfully walnuty, rich sherry with a high degree of alcohol (about 20 percent). Olorosos don’t develop flor and take longer to mature than finos. While olorosos are also frequently sweetened (and labeled cream sherry), the best examples are dry.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><strong>PALO CORTADO</strong> is the much prized, complex maverick sherry that begins life as amontillado, then “mutates” into an oloroso, sharing the best characteristics of both. A special treat, it’s worth seeking out.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent1"><strong>PEDRO XIMENEZ,</strong> or PX, is the raisiny-sweet unctuous dessert sherry made from Pedro Ximénez grapes, which are traditionally dried in the sun.</p>

<h3 class="h3">TUNA TARTARE WITH DATES AND TOMATOES</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>TARTAR DE ATUN CON DATILES Y TOMATES</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Inspired by a recipe from the gifted La Rioja chef Francis Paniego, this brilliant dish will seduce even people who think they’ve OD’d on tuna tartare. Intensely Mediterranean, with a surprising sweet touch of dates, it is extremely simple to make but does require terrific ingredients: sashimi-quality tuna, aromatic tomatoes with a lively acidity, and your loveliest, fruitiest olive oil. The creamy, garlicky almond sauce elevates the dish to further heights, but if you are in a hurry the tartare is also delicious with nothing more than a drizzle of olive oil.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>3 medium-size, ripe but firm tomatoes, peeled with a vegetable peeler, seeded, and diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 to 5 medium-size dates, finely diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>7 tablespoons fragrant extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling on the tuna</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ teaspoons best-quality white wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 to 7 ounces sashimi-quality tuna, finely diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Flaky sea salt, such as Maldon</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons slivered fresh basil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Creamy Almond Sauce (<a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_60">recipe follows</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the tomatoes and dates in a bowl, separating the date pieces with a fork so they don’t clump together. Toss with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and the vinegar and let stand for about 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the tuna in another bowl, toss it with a pinch of salt, rubbing the salt lightly into the fish. Add the tuna to the tomato mixture and stir in the remaining olive oil and the basil.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> To serve, press a quarter of the tuna mixture in a small cup, such as an espresso cup or a ¼- or ⅓-cup measuring cup, then unmold it onto a pretty serving plate. Repeat with the remaining tuna mixture. Spoon some of the Creamy Almond Sauce around each tartare. Drizzle a little olive oil over both the sauce and the tuna. Sprinkle sea salt on top of the tuna tartares and serve at once. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4</strong></span></p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_60"/><small>CREAMY ALMOND SAUCE</small></h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>SALSA DE AJO BLANCO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">In the last few years, it has become fashionable among Spanish chefs to serve <em>ajo blanco</em> (the Andalusian almond gazpacho) as a sauce for seafood. It’s an inspired idea. Just remember, you’ll need to make the sauce at least a half hour before you plan on serving it, to allow the flavor to develop.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>½ slice white sandwich bread</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup blanched almonds, finely ground in a food processor</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon sherry vinegar, preferably aged, or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size garlic clove, crushed with a garlic press</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Crumble the bread into a small sieve and run cold water over it for a few seconds, until the bread almost dissolves. Drain well.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the bread in a blender along with the almonds, 3 tablespoons cold water, and the vinegar and process to a paste. With the motor running, drizzle in the olive oil, as if making mayonnaise.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Scrape the almond mixture into a bowl, add the garlic, and season with salt to taste. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the sauce stand for at least 30 minutes for the flavors to develop. Just before serving, taste the sauce and add a little more vinegar if you think it needs more kick. If the sauce seems too thick, thin it with cold water until it has the consistency of a thin mayonnaise. This sauce will keep for 2 days, covered, in the refrigerator. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES ABOUT ½ CUP</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3g">GRATINEED OYSTERS WITH SPINACH</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>OSTRAS GRATINADAS CON ESPINACAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">These showstopping oysters and spinach, with a lush cap of bubbling gratinéed saffron hollandaise, are a specialty at Aloña Berri, a wonderfully creative tapas bar in San Sebastián. The owner, José Ramón Elizondo, says that it’s his Basque take on oysters Rockefeller.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 small garlic cloves, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 cups firmly packed fresh baby spinach, rinsed, drained, and chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 large oysters, shells well scrubbed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 small or 1 jumbo egg yolk</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 tablespoons (¾ stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small pinch of saffron, pulverized in a mortar and steeped in 2 teaspoons very hot water</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 or 3 lemon wedges, for serving</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About 3 cups kosher salt, for serving</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the spinach, increase the heat to medium-high, and cook until just wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Season the spinach with salt to taste, transfer <a id="page_61"/>it to a bowl, and let cool while you prepare the oysters. (The spinach can be prepared up to a day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Shuck the oysters, straining their liquor into a bowl. Carefully remove the oysters from their shells, reserve the deep bottom shells, and discard the top shells. (Or you can ask your fishmonger to shuck the oysters; request that as much of the oyster liquor as possible remains with the oysters.) Rinse the bottom shells well and dry them.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place the egg yolks and lemon juice in a small bowl and whisk to mix. Fill a medium-size skillet halfway with water and bring to a simmer. Place the yolk mixture and the butter in a small saucepan and set it in the skillet. Reduce the heat to a minimum, so that the water in the skillet is just below a simmer. Stir the butter mixture with a wooden spoon until the butter just melts. Using a whisk, whisk the sauce continuously until it thickens, about 1 minute. Do not overcook or let the sauce get too hot or it will curdle. Scrape the sauce into a bowl and stir in the saffron. Season with salt to taste and add a little more lemon juice, if you like.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Preheat the broiler.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Spread the kosher salt on a broiler-proof platter to a depth of ½ inch, covering the platter completely. Place a little spinach in each oyster shell, sprinkle a little of the oyster liquor over it, and add a squeeze of lemon juice, then place an oyster on top. Top with about 1 teaspoon of the hollandaise sauce. Repeat with the remaining oysters and shells, nestling the filled shells in the salt.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Broil the oysters about 4 inches away from the heat until the sauce is bubbling and browned in spots, about 2 minutes. Serve at once. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES 12</strong></span></p>

<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Tapas can be as simple as small plates of store-bought olives, anchovies, fried almonds, chorizo slices, and quartered piquillo peppers passed around with predinner drinks. Or they can make up a whole colorful meal or buffet of small dishes. If you want to go the latter route, try presenting a varied menu that combines something fried really crunchy and something baked; something briny and something mild; something saucy or salady and something dry. Because at Spanish bars tapas are usually served consecutively, each on its own plate, I always urge my friends to try one thing after another, rather than mix all the flavors and dishes on one plate. (They never listen.)</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Any tapas bash should begin with a trip to the market for Spanish cheeses, olives, marcona almonds, anchovies, and dry-cured chorizo or good salami. Then pick a few recipes from this chapter, a salad, some canapés or an empanada, one of the tortillas in the egg chapter, perhaps a meatball dish, and saucy mussels or clams. In addition, here are ten more tapas ideas so simple they don’t really require proper recipes.</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• Boiled diced potatoes with chopped red onion, piquillo peppers, chunks of good tuna, loads of good olive oil, and a splash of sherry vinegar</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• <em>Boquerones</em> (white anchovies) on a bed of julienned piquillo peppers or pimientos, drizzled with reduced balsamic vinegar and sprinkled with parsley</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• Cubes of Manchego cheese marinated in olive oil with aromatic herbs, such as thyme and rosemary</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• Simple seafood kebabs brushed with olive oil that has been flavored with garlic and pimentón, grilled or broiled, and served with Toasted Hazelnut Romesco Dip (<a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_30">page 30</a>) or Colorful Saffron Allioli (<a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_45">page 45</a>)</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• Smoked salmon slices rolled around a salad of cooked salmon tossed with diced apples and cornichons, shredded lettuce, and mayo; served on endive spears</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• Steamed mussels, cooled and served on the half shell, drizzled with a vinaigrette of olive oil and white wine vinegar, a sprinkling of diced red, green, and yellow bell peppers, and parsley</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• Dates stuffed with marcona almonds, Cabrales cheese, or small chunks of chorizo, wrapped in bacon and baked or broiled until crisp (turning them once)</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• Lightly steamed fat asparagus stalks, wrapped in piquillo pepper halves, then in serrano ham slices, and grilled, griddled, or broiled for a few minutes</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• Green grapes rolled in goat cheese, coated in coarsely chopped toasted almonds, and chilled for about 1 hour</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• Grilled or roasted fig halves wrapped in serrano ham slices or topped with a smear of Cabrales</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• A smear of Cabrales on dried figs that have been macerated in port wine and drained</p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>CROQUETAS DE DATILES Y ROQUEFORT</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">It’s a pleasure to go around the La Boqueria market in Barcelona tasting and comparing the <em>croquetas</em> served at the various lunch counters. While the spinach, pine nut, and raisin croquettes at Quim de la Boqueria are sublime, my prize goes to Bar Pinotxo for its crisp Roquefort and date fritters. Their combination of sweetness and pungency is fabulous. This is my adaptation of the dish.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>5 medium-size pitted dates</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Boiling water</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 tablespoons (½ stick) unsalted butter</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 tablespoons all-purpose flour, plus more for breading the croquettes</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ cups whole milk</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 ounces blue cheese, such as Roquefort or Cabrales, finely crumbled (about 1 cup)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 or 3 gratings of nutmeg</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground white pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 large eggs</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About 2 cups fine dry white bread crumbs, for breading the croquettes</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the dates in a small heatproof bowl, add boiling water to cover, and let soak until softened, 10 to 15 minutes. Thoroughly drain the dates, then mince them.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Melt the butter in 5 teaspoons of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the flour and cook, stirring, until a smooth paste forms, about 1 minute. Increase the heat to medium-high and gradually add the milk, whisking constantly, until the mixture is completely smooth, about 1 minute. Add the blue cheese and the minced dates and stir until the cheese is completely melted. Reduce the heat to low and stir the mixture with a wooden spoon until it begins to pull away from the side of the skillet, 3 to 5 minutes. Grate in the nutmeg and season with salt and white pepper to taste. Scrape the croquette mixture into a well-oiled shallow bowl that is 6 to 7 inches in diameter and has straight sides. Let cool to room temperature, place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of the croquette mixture, and chill until firm, at least 3 hours. (The croquette mixture can be prepared up to a day ahead.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place some flour in a shallow bowl; beat the eggs in a second shallow bowl; and place the bread crumbs in a third shallow bowl. Arrange the bowls in that order for easy breading. Lightly flour your hands, then break off a scant tablespoon of the croquette mixture. Lightly roll it in the flour, shaking off the excess, then roll it gently between your hands to form <a id="page_64"/>an oval. (Alternatively, you can invert the croquette mixture onto a cutting board and using a floured knife cut the croquettes into 1-inch cubes.) Dip the croquette in the beaten egg, then dip it generously in the bread crumbs. Transfer the croquette to a small baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining mixture. Croquettes rolled in bread crumbs will keep in the refrigerator, covered, for at least a day; see the last paragraph in the box on the <a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_65">following page</a>.</p>

Fry the croquettes, 6 or 7 at a time, until deep golden on all sides, turning once and adjusting the heat so the oil doesn’t burn. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried croquettes to the paper towels to drain.

White and black truffle oils are sold at many gourmet markets; though they may seem expensive, they’re actually quite a bargain, since a little goes a very long way.

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_65"/>CROQUETAS CALLING</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">The Spanish are addicted to <em>croquetas</em> (croquettes), those perfectly crisp fried shells with a silky, oozy béchamel center. “Croquetas are a genius fusion of a classic French sauce with the Spanish art of frying,” says my friend José Carlos Capel, the food critic for <em>El País</em> newspaper. “It must have been some ingenious cook in the late nine-teeneth century who discovered that you can fry pieces of leftover béchamel,” Capel adds. From then on, croquettes entered the repertoire of bourgeois Spanish home cooks. These days, they are a staple both at home and at countless tapas bars all over the country. When done well, there’s almost nothing I’d rather eat.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">The secret to a <em>croqueta</em> with an almost liquid interior is to make the béchamel sauce rather thin (3 tablespoons flour per 1 cup milk is a good proportion). Then, the mixture needs plenty of chilling time to become firm enough to be shaped, breaded, and fried. Thrifty <em>abuelas</em> (grand-mothers) flavor their <em>croquetas</em> with shredded leftover meats from a <em>cocido</em>—a boiled dinner—or with roast turkey or chicken, but the possibilities are almost infinite. To make about three dozen croquettes, start with a béchamel base made with 2 tablespoons olive oil and 4 tablespoons butter, 5 tablespoons flour, and 1½ cups milk (see the recipe on the <a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_64a">previous page</a> for detailed instructions). You can stir a heaping cup of any of the following into this béchamel base.</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• Shredded leftover poultry, diced serrano ham, and a little minced parsley</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• Shredded roast pork or lamb or leftover stew and diced piquillo peppers</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• Chopped cooked seafood or finely flaked fish or salt cod (for the béchamel, use half milk, half fish stock or clam juice)</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• Finely chopped wild mushrooms sautéed in olive oil with garlic, parsley, and a dash of dry sherry</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• Finely chopped Spinach with Raisins and Pine Nuts (<a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#page_388">page 388</a>)</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• A combination of flaked cooked salmon, chopped smoked salmon, and about 3 ounces cream cheese</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• A combination of shredded Manchego, Cheddar, or Gruyère; Parmesan; and diced pimientos</p>
<p class="sb-indent1">You can add any grated cheese of your choice; diced cooked vegetables, such as potatoes, carrots, or broccoli; such spices as paprika, cayenne, or nutmeg; and fresh or dried herbs to any of these fillings. For the béchamel, instead of using all milk, try adding half milk and half stock, the flavorful juices from roast poultry or meat, or a little wine.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Once the batter is well chilled, traditionally home cooks shape <em>croquetas</em> into balls, ovals, or cylinders with the help of two teaspoons. A speedier method is to chill the béchamel in a well-oiled straight-sided dish (the layer should be at least ½inch thick), then invert it onto a cutting board and cut it into rectangles or squares. Or the chilled béchamel mixture can be rolled out into ropes, then cut into cylinders. <em>Croquetas</em> can be shaped and breaded way ahead of time. However, before frying them, check for cracks in the breading, lest the filling leak out. Cracks can be fixed by rolling the cracked croquette in more bread crumbs.</p>

<h3 class="h3">BLACK-AND-WHITE CALAMARI FRITTERS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>CALAMARES A LA ROMANA REBOZADAS CON SU TINTO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Of the delicious multitude of seafood fritters I tasted in Spain, these stand out as the most dramatic and memorable—the sort of dish that instantly provokes gasps of excitement. For one, the beer batter is so light that tempura seems leaden in comparison. But the real surprise here is the colors: a batter hued jet-black by squid ink, with snow-white <em>calamares</em> hiding inside. This is one of many scandalously delicious creations of Quim Marquéz, a Barcelona chef who can work miracles with just one or two simple flavors at his <a id="page_67"/>restaurant El Suquet de l’Almirall. Quim extracts ink from the squid himself, but the plastic packets of squid ink imported from Spain are a fine, labor-saving option. Quim recommends serving the fritters with Roasted Garlic or Colorful Saffron Allioli (<a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_45">page 45</a>); they are just as good with lemon wedges or on their own. If you don’t have squid ink, the fritter will still be delicious without it.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>½ pound cleaned squid, patted thoroughly dry</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ cup all-purpose flour</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ teaspoon baking powder</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large egg, beaten</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ cup cold lager-style beer</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 to 4 packets (each 4 grams/.14 ounce) squid ink (about 1 teaspoon total; see <a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#ch02_note5">Note</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Olive oil, for frying</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Allioli (<a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_44">page 44</a>), or lemon wedges, for serving</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Cut the squid bodies into ⅓-inch-wide rings. Rub all the squid with a little salt and let stand while you prepare the batter. Set a small rack over a baking sheet and line it with a double thickness of paper towels.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Sift the flour and baking powder together into a large bowl. Gradually whisk in the egg and beer, whisking until the batter is completely smooth. Whisk in ½ teaspoon salt and enough squid ink to color the batter a purplish dark gray.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Pour olive oil to a depth of 1½ inches in a large, deep skillet and heat it over medium-high heat to 360°F; when hot, batter placed in the oil will sizzle on contact. Add a third of the squid rings to the batter and stir until completely coated. Using a fork, remove the squid rings from the batter, shaking off the excess. Place the battered squid in the hot oil and fry until the batter is puffed up and the squid is just cooked through, 1 to 1½ minutes per side. As you cook, lower the heat as needed so that the squid has a chance to cook through without the batter burning. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried squid to the paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining squid rings. Serve immediately with <em>allioli</em> or lemon wedges. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6 AS A TAPA, 4 AS A LIGHT FIRST COURSE</strong></span></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="ch02_note5"/><span class="blue"><strong>NOTE:</strong></span> As the intensity of the ink can vary, use as many packets as you need to get a very dark batter. If the ink inside the packets seems a little congealed, warm the packets in a pot of hot water.</p>

<h3 class="h3g">PEAR – SHAPED SALT COD FRITTERS LA SIRENA</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>PERITAS DE BACALAO LA SIRENA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Spanish cooks can usually make good salt cod fritters in their sleep. But those made by Mari Carmen Vélez, the feisty chef at La Sirena restaurant in Alicante, are in a league of their own. Not only are hers impeccably fluffy and crisp; they are also adorable—shaped like tiny pears. Little wonder that the tapas bar at La Sirena is always mobbed.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 pound medium-size Yukon Gold potatoes, unpeeled</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ pound boneless salt cod, soaked and cooked (see <a class="nounder" href="ch07.html#page_198">page 198</a>), then drained</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Basic One-Cup Allioli (<a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_44">page 44</a>) or Mock Allioli (<a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_45">page 45</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon finely minced fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large egg, beaten</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Olive oil or mild vegetable oil, for frying</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About 24 pieces of parsley stem (each 1 inch long)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Lemon wedges (optional), for serving</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the potatoes in a large saucepan, add cold water to cover by 2 inches, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and cook the potatoes, partially covered, until they are completely tender when pierced with a skewer, about 30 minutes. Drain and let cool.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Shred the salt cod finely with your fingers, removing and discarding any bones.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> When the potatoes are just cool enough to handle, peel them and grate on the large holes of <a id="page_69"/>a box grater into a large bowl. Add the salt cod and, using a fork, stir the cod and the potatoes together until the mixture is thoroughly combined (do not overmix or the potatoes will release too much starch). Stir in 2 tablespoons of the <em>allioli,</em> then taste for seasoning, adding a little salt, if necessary. Add the egg and stir to mix thoroughly. Refrigerate the salt cod mixture, covered, for 1 hour.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Wet your hands slightly and shape the salt cod mixture into 1½-inch balls. Place the balls on a plate, pressing them down to flatten one side slightly, then pat them into a pear shape.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Pour olive oil to a depth of 1 inch in a large, heavy skillet and heat it over medium-high heat to 360°F; when hot, a bit of salt cod mixture placed in the oil will sizzle on contact. Fry a few fritters in the oil, flat side first, until golden brown on all sides, about 1½ minutes total. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fritters to paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining fritters. Once all the fritters are fried, insert a parsley stem in the narrow end of each. Serve immediately with <em>allioli</em> and lemon wedges, if desired. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES 22 TO 24</strong></span></p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_68"/>MADRID TAPEO</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">When it comes to <em>tapeos,</em> Madrid has a split personality. There is the Madrid of the fast-talking, street-smart, tripe-loving <em>castizos</em>—pure-blood, working-class <em>madrileños</em> who are the Spanish answer to British cockneys. (This is a city that was once famous for its profusion of populist taverns where the aristocracy rubbed shoulders with <em>toreros</em> and flamenco musicians.) Then there is the <em>pijo,</em> or yuppie Madrid, which favors fast cars, designer labels, and haute cuisine tapas served up in modish surroundings in the upmarket barrio of Salamanca. And there’s everything in between: The Madrid of blue-blooded <em>señoras</em> who decorously nibble on salmon canapés at the neo-rococo Café de Oriente. The Madrid of gypsies who scarf down <em>jamón</em> after-hours at the legendary flamenco haunt, Casa Patas. The melting pot Madrid, with its Asturian, Galician, Andalusian, and Basque taverns, Irish pubs, Moroccan joints, and Cuban cocktail bars.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Madrid’s <em>castizo</em> old center remains a trove of dark, battered <em>tabernas, tascas,</em> and beer halls, with their well-worn zinc counters, tiled walls, macho meatballs, griddled pig’s ears, and vermouth on tap. Searching for the crispest, lightest batter-fried bacalao, I fight the dense crowds that spill onto the pavement of Casa Labra, a haunt famous as much for its salt cod as for being the birthplace of the Spanish socialist party. The broth from a <em>cocido</em> (boiled dinner), a popular lunchtime pick-me-up, is fortifying and perfectly clear at Lhardy. Upstairs there’s an early nineteenth-century restaurant straight out of an old master painting; downstairs, a small deli dispenses its consommé from an ornate silver samovar, along with dainty savory puff pastries displayed in glass cases. Then, off for a taste of the legendary “smashed” eggs with french fries at the bar of Casa Lucio, a blue-chip <em>taberna</em> where members of Spain’s royal family might be dining within the pass-the-salt range of couples in faded jeans. Other signature Madrid tapas all have their bars. For garlicky shrimp there’s the minuscule century-old Casa del Abuelo. The definitive <em>patatas bravas,</em> with a spicy, smoky tomato sauce, can be found at the loud, overlit Las Bravas. And in Los Austrias—the Hapsburg heart of Madrid—new-wave bars are luring young crowds with boutique cheeses, charcuterie, and fancy wines by the glass.</p>

<p class="noindent">Ladies and gentlemen, here is one of Spain’s most definitive tapas. <em>Bravas</em>—fierce—refers to the spicy tomato sauce, for which there are as many recipes as there are tapas bar owners. My version was inspired by the smooth, smoky, <em>pimentón</em>-tinged sauce at Las Bravas, a bar that’s been doing a booming <em>patatas bravas</em> business in Madrid for over a century. In the Catalan manner, I drizzle my <em>bravas</em> with both the tomato sauce and garlicky <em>allioli</em> mayonnaise, which makes the dish insanely delicious. At good bars, the cubed potatoes are deep-fried twice, first in coolish oil and then in very hot oil to crisp them. I present an easier option, using small red potatoes that are parboiled, cut into quarters, and crisped in the oven. Serve them skewered on toothpicks.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>16 small red potatoes (1½ to 2 inches in diameter)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 to 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Spicy Tomato Sauce (<a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_71a">recipe follows</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About ¼ cup any Allioli (<a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_44">pages 44</a> to <a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_45">45</a>), thinned with 1 to 2 tablespoons water</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_71"/><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the potatoes in a large saucepan, add cold water to cover by 2 inches, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and cook the potatoes, partially covered, until they are completely tender when pierced with a skewer, about 20 minutes. Do not overcook. Drain and let cool. When just cool enough to handle, cut them into quarters.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 475°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place the quartered potatoes, 3 tablespoons of the olive oil, and some salt in a bowl and toss to coat evenly, adding more oil, if needed. Be careful not to crush the potatoes. Spread the potatoes in a single layer on a large rimmed baking sheet and bake, turning once, until crisp and browned, about 45 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Arrange the potatoes on a serving platter and generously drizzle Spicy Tomato Sauce and <em>allioli</em> over them. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4 TO 6</strong></span></p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>SALSA DE TOMATE PICANTE</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">I’ve purposely proportioned this recipe so that you’ll have some left over. It keeps for several days and is delicious with just about anything.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>4½ teaspoons olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small onion, minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 garlic cloves, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ teaspoon smoked sweet Spanish paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ teaspoon ground cumin</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size pinch of crushed red pepper flakes</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 can (15 ounces) peeled plum tomatoes, chopped, with their liquid (about 1½ cups)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons distilled white vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large pinch of sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>

Cover the saucepan and simmer until the tomatoes have cooked down to a puree, 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding a little more water if the sauce seems too thick. Add the vinegar and sugar. Season the sauce with salt and Tabasco sauce to taste and remove it from the heat. Let the sauce cool for a few minutes, then puree it in a blender. Let the sauce cool to room temperature, taste it again, and add more salt and/or Tabasco as necessary. Stored in a clean jar, with a film of olive oil on top, the sauce can be refrigerated for up to a week. Let it return to room temperature before using. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES ABOUT 1¾ CUPS</strong></span></p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_72"/>WANDERING CADIZ</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">I could easily spend the rest of my days in Cádiz, a raffish whitewashed Andalusian city strung out along a thin three-mile-long peninsula that extends into the Atlantic like a gaunt, outstretched arm. Cádiz is the place to perfect the art of the <em>paseo,</em> joining the crowds of sailors, lovers, and older <em>gitanas</em> for a panoramic amble by the bay; to linger over brandy-laced coffee on a palm-shaded plaza; to wander the narrow streets in the echo of babbling locals who lean perilously out of the windows to gawk at the passersby. Another one of the city’s great pleasures is <em>tortillitas de camarones,</em> lacy-crisp pancakes made with <em>camarones,</em> minuscule crustaceans of the shrimp family. The pancakes are believed to have been invented by a local lady known as the <em>guapa de churros</em> (fried crullers belle) and were originally prepared with chickpea flour and sold at <em>churrerías,</em> or cruller joints. Over time, <em>tortillitas</em> became one of the most famous dishes of the Cádiz province and are now enjoyed as a tapa all over Andalusia and beyond.</p>

<h3 class="h3g">CRISP SHRIMP PANCAKES FROM CADIZ</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>TORTILLITAS DE CAMARONES</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">In Cádiz, the shrimp are mixed into the pancake batter while still live and in their delicate shells. If you use ordinary shrimp, the intense marine smack and some of the crunch will be missing, but the pancakes are still a delight when prepared at home. These days, the original chickpea flour is mostly replaced by the coarse wheat flour used for coating fried fish (a mixture of all-purpose and semolina flour is a good substitute). For the pancakes to come out greaseless, the oil has to be very hot; for them to be crisp rather than spongy, it is important to quickly spread the batter out in the pan so it is as thin as possible.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>6 ounces medium-size shrimp, shells and tails removed and set aside, shrimp chopped medium-fine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup all-purpose flour</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup chickpea flour (available at Indian groceries), or ½ cup medium to coarse semolina</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons grated onion</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Olive oil, for frying</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the shrimp shells and tails in a small saucepan with 2 cups water and bring to a boil. Cover the saucepan, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool completely. Strain the shrimp liquid into a bowl and discard the shells.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Rub the chopped shrimp with a little salt and let stand while you mix the batter. Sift together the all-purpose flour, chickpea flour, and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Whisk in 1¼ cups of the shrimp liquid, setting the rest aside. Whisk the batter until it is fairly smooth. Add the onion, parsley, and shrimp <a id="page_73"/>and stir to mix evenly. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the batter for 2 to 4 hours. Let come to room temperature before frying.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Whisk 4 to 6 tablespoons of the reserved shrimp liquid into the batter, using enough to give it the consistency of medium-thin pancake batter.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Set a small rack over a baking sheet and line it with a double thickness of paper towels. Pour olive oil to a depth of ½ inch in a medium-size skillet and heat it over medium-high heat to 375°F; when hot, a piece of batter placed in the oil will sizzle on contact. Place a heaping tablespoon of the batter in the oil and immediately flatten the batter with the back of a spoon to form a thin pancake about 2½ inches in diameter. Repeat with 4 more tablespoons of batter. Fry the pancakes until crisp and golden brown, 30 to 50 seconds per side, then using a slotted spoon, transfer them to the paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining batter, frying 5 or 6 pancakes at a time. (If you like, you can keep the finished pancakes warm in a 300°F oven until all the batter is cooked.) The pancakes are best straight from the frying pan, but you can also make <em>tortillitas</em> ahead and reheat them for 5 to 7 minutes in a 475°F oven before serving. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES 20 TO 22</strong></span></p>
