any foreigners find the <em>carnicería</em>
 or butchers stall a rather disturbing sight, there is certainly no attempt to mask the origins of the miniature lamb cutlets or the petite veal tongues. There is no place for sentimentality when buying meat in the market. Entire carcasses are often butchered with remarkable dexterity right under the customer’s nose. You could almost piece the animal back together like a jigsaw puzzle since most of the extremities and offal are on sale too. The range of meat on offer will depend on the region and also the size of the market.</p>
<p class="indent">Barcelona’s Boquería is home to over 35 butchers. Many of them sell the celebrated veal from Gerona or lamb from the neighbouring region of Aragón, while others specialize in horse meat or kid. You can pick up beef from Galicia or even the Argentine; the Boquería is a truly cosmopolitan place. There are plenty of offal, <em>menudos</em>
 or <em>depojos</em>
, stalls too. Rugs of white tripe, glistening kidneys, livers and hearts all make delicious eating, given the right treatment. It has to be said that the cheaper offal recipes do usually require a lot more love and attention than a choice cut of meat. Nowadays the clientele tend to be older ladies with the time or inclination to invest in the preparation, or those who are watching their pennies. Traditional offal dishes such as the Catalan <em>Cap I Pota</em>
, or stewed calf’s head and foot, or the famed <em>Callos a la Madrileña</em>
, Madrid-style tripe, are more likely to be found in the bar or local restaurant than in the home today.</p>
<p class="indent">Provincial markets still reflect the traditional livestock of the area although other meats are available too. Sheep have always been the top of the bill in the arid lands of Navarre, Aragón, Castille, Extremadura and Murcia where a cow wouldn’t stand a chance. In Aragón Zaragoza’s municipal market is a lamb showcase, as well as the tiny milk-fed <em>corderos lechales</em>
 and the cuts of <em>ternasco</em>
, or spring lamb (see page 62), there are sheep’s heads, lengths of intestine wound up like balls of wool, pearly white feet and even bunches of tails for the strangely named dish of ‘mountain asparagus’. Cattle are confined to the richer pasturelands of Northern Spain, but most are slaughtered young and consumed as veal, the precious grazing is required for the dairy herds. Galicia’s veal, <em>ternera</em>
, is reputedly the best in Spain while it is the Basque’s who relish the huge rib steaks of the older ox, <em>buey</em>
. Pork, however, can be found in every market in the land.</p>
<p class="indent">In the old days families used to raise their own pig, fed on the household leftovers. The <em>matanza</em>
, or slaughter, was celebrated with a feast of fresh pork although most of the meat was transformed into <em>embutidos</em>
, or cured meats to last the winter. The modern tendency towards apartment living has all but knocked the custom on the head. Nowadays pork is usually the most economical meat on the butcher’s slab although there are a few dramatic exceptions. <em>Cochinillo</em>
, or suckling pig is an expensive delicacy, ideally roasted in a wood-burning oven until it becomes so tender that it can reputedly be carved with a plate. Few would attempt to cook this at home but the upmarket <em>carnicería</em>
 often has a couple on display on the off chance. The fresh meat of the Iberian pig, best known for its celebrated cured ham is sometimes available too, at a price, but most is snapped up by restaurant chefs before the rest of us get a look in.</p>

<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_4">honeyed spare ribs</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Ribs are one of the most economical cuts of pork on offer. They are easy to prepare and fabulously sticky and satisfying to munch in the fingers. I came across 101 variations on this recipe: some used white wine or dry sherry instead of the lemon juice, others added a sprig of rosemary, a bay leaf, cloves or a chilli for extra flavour. So do feel free to improvise too.</p>
<p class="indent">I adore the simplicity and the sweet-sour nature of this version. You could finish cooking the ribs on the barbecue too if you enjoy your meat charred.</p>
<p class="indent">You will need to begin this recipe a few hours in advance.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4.</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1.5 kg/3 lb pork ribs</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>juice of 2 lemons</strong>

<p class="extract">Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/Gas Mark 4.</p>
<p class="extract">Place the ribs in a roasting tin and cook for 1 hour until tender.</p>
<p class="extract">Remove the ribs from the oven. Increase the oven temperature to 220°C/425°F/ Gas Mark 7.</p>
<p class="extract">Next, take 1 tbsp of the juices and mix with honey, olive oil and salt. Pour the honey mixture over the ribs and cook for about 20 minutes, basting a couple of times, until the juices begin to caramelize.</p>
<p class="extract">Serve at once.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Tip</strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A bitter salad of watercress or curly endive would make an ideal accompaniment, contrasting beautifully with the sweetness of the ribs.</p>

<strong>Buying pork</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent5">
<span class="gray">In times gone by most families had their own pig, a kind of household waste disposal, which they fattened up during the year. The <em>matanza</em>
, or slaughter was, and still is for some, a time for celebration, feasting and stocking the larder. Much of the meat was cured to last the winter while other cuts were eaten at once.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">You may have qualms about tucking into the family pig, but at least it ensured a free-range animal reared on natural food, a far cry from much of the intensively farmed pork on offer in the shops today.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">Do try to find a purveyor of <em>cerdo ecológico</em>
, or organic pork, or that of a small-scale, specialist producer at least. Welfare concerns aside, the flavour and texture of the meat will be incomparable.</span>

lomo adobado</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_6">marinated pork tenderloin</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Marinated pork pops up all over Spain. It is a fiesta day classic in the Canary Islands, part of the <em>matanza</em>
 (see page 57) ritual in Galicia and a common bar snack in Andalucia where the pork is served on a small piece of bread and called a <em>montadito</em>
. The meat is marinated for anything between 12 hours and 3 days and then fried on the <em>plancha</em>
, or griddle, or roasted in the oven. The choice is yours.</p>
<p class="indent">You will need to begin this recipe at least a day in advance.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 x medium-sized pork tenderloins</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tbsp olive oil</strong>
</p>

<strong>1 lemon, cut into wedges</strong>
</p>

<span class="gray"><br/>

</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<span class="gray">for the marinade</span>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>6 garlic cloves</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>½ tsp salt</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tbsp sweet paprika</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>½ tsp hot paprika</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>100 ml/3½ fl oz white wine</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp wine vinegar</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>6 tbsp olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tsp fresh or 1 tsp dried thyme</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tsp fresh or 1 tsp dried oregano</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Trim any excess fat or membrane from the pork.</p>
<p class="extract">Crush the garlic with the salt in a mortar with a pestle, then mix all the ingredients for the marinade together in a small dish, just big enough for the pork to fit snugly. Add the pork, turning to cover the meat in the marinade, cover and refrigerate overnight or keep for a few days, the flavours will only improve.</p>
<p class="extract">When you are ready to cook the pork, remove the tenderloin from the marinade and cut, slightly on the diagonal, into thin 1 cm/ ½ inch slices.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat a griddle or heavy frying pan with a little olive oil and fry the pork in batches. Do not be tempted to overcook the meat, it should still be a little pink and tender in the centre (see right).</p>
<p class="extract">Serve with the lemon wedges and a green salad or as montaditos on slices of bread topped with some grilled green peppers.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>To roast the pork</strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/Gas Mark 5.</p>
<p class="extract">Sear the whole tenderloins on a very hot griddle or in a frying pan with a little olive oil. Once lightly browned return to the marinade and roast the pork for 20–30 minutes until just cooked through. The meat should remain a little pink in the centre.</p>
<p class="extract">Leave to rest for a few minutes while you boil down the marinade to a glossy sauce. Slice the pork thickly and serve as above.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Cooking pork</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent5">
<span class="gray">Many cuts of pork such as the loin or tenderloin are extremely lean and apt to dry out and turn leathery if you are not careful. Marinating, crumbing or wrapping in fat and bacon will help to protect the meat.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">Pork is still often cooked to the point that it is devoid of any moisture at all. In the old days there was the fear of contracting trichinosis, whereas nowadays this risk is almost non-existent if buying pork from reliable sources. Use a meat thermometer if you feel cautious. The parasite would be killed in any case once the core temperature of your meat reaches 65°C/150°F, a far cry from the desiccated cardboard often served. In fact today the meat is served pink and juicy in many upbeat Spanish restaurants and delicious it is too.</span>

libritos de cerdo</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_8">ham and cheese stuffed pork</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Yet another example of the more positive face of ready-meals, these little ‘books’ of pork loin can often be purchased stuffed, crumbed and ready for the pan. If you are starting from scratch then slicing the pieces of pork open is your only challenge and I have found most butchers are very obliging and happy to cut the meat ready for stuffing. You could try using slices of aubergine instead of the pork for another simple supper dish.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>8 thick slices of pork loin</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 slices of cooked ham</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4–8 slices of good melting cheese, such as young Mahón or Emmental</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>100 g/4 oz plain flour</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 eggs, beaten</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>150 g/5 oz breadcrumbs</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 tbsp olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Cut the slices of pork loin horizontally until you can open them out like a book. You may be able to persuade your butcher to do this for you. Open out the pork slices and stuff them with a slice of ham and an equal-sized piece of cheese. Close the pork around the stuffing and press down firmly on a board.</p>
<p class="extract">Now for the production line: place the flour, beaten eggs and breadcrumbs on separate large plates. Dip the pork loin first in the flour, then the beaten egg and lastly in the breadcrumbs. Once all the pork is ready, and this can be prepared and refrigerated well ahead of time, it is time to heat the olive oil in a large frying pan.</p>
<p class="extract">Fry the pork, in batches, until crisp and golden. It will be just a matter of 2–3 minutes on each side.</p>
<p class="extract">Drain on kitchen paper and keep warm until all the meat is fried and ready to serve.</p>

jarretes de cordero con aceitunas</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_10">spiced lamb shanks with olives</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Even in Andalucia, after seven centuries of Moorish rule, North African inspired dishes such as this one are not as common as one might imagine. It can be a serious challenge tracking down coriander, a predominant flavour in Morocco, just a matter of miles away across the Straits of Gibraltar. So, I was thrilled to be arrested by its distinctive aroma under the Moorish archway of Málaga’s bustling market. There were generous bunches of mint and parsley on offer too. Any of these herbs match well with the lamb, giving a burst of freshness to the slow-cooked spices. You will need to begin this recipe 24 hours in advance.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 lamb shanks</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 tbsp olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 onions, finely sliced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>8 garlic cloves, unpeeled</strong>

<strong>200 g/7 oz stoned black olives</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>a handful of freshly chopped coriander, parsley or mint, to garnish</strong>
</p>

<span class="gray"><br/>
</span>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">

</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1½ tsp freshly ground cinnamon</strong>

<strong>1½ tsp ground ginger</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tsp freshly ground cumin</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tsp freshly ground coriander</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>½ tsp hot non-smoked paprika</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">For the spice mix, mix all the ground spices together in a small bowl and rub them over the outside of the lamb shanks. Place the lamb in the refrigerator and leave to absorb the flavours overnight.</p>
<p class="extract">Preheat the oven to 170°C/325°F/Gas Mark 3.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat the olive oil in a terracotta <em>cazuela</em>
 or cast-iron casserole and brown the lamb shanks. Once the meat has seared, creating colour and flavour in your finished dish, you can set the shanks aside.</p>
<p class="extract">Next, using the same oil, fry the onions until they are soft and lightly browned. Add the garlic and flour and stir thoroughly until the flour begins to colour. Slowly add the wine, stirring all the time together with the water. Season with a little salt to taste.</p>
<p class="extract">Return the shanks to the casserole, cover with a tight-fitting lid and place in the oven. Traditionally the pot would remain on the stove, as few households had ovens in the old days. However, unless you are a pressure cooker enthusiast, I would recommend that you place the dish in the oven and go about your other business with no fear of a burnt bottom.</p>
<p class="extract">After 1½ hours, add the olives to the lamb and cook for a further 30 minutes, or until the meat is really tender.</p>
<p class="extract">Sprinkle with freshly chopped herbs and serve with chickpeas, couscous, mashed potato or a doorstep of good bread.</p>

<strong>Buying lamb</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent5">
<span class="gray">
<em>Cordero lechal</em>
, milk-fed lamb, up to 1½ months old, is an extremely expensive delicacy that is best roasted in the domed, wood-fired ovens typical of Castilla and Aragón. The flesh is pale, incredibly tender and very delicately flavoured.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">
<em>Ternasco</em>
, up to 4 months old, has just begun to feed on the fresh spring pastures. This is premium meat to serve simply roasted or grilled with no need for sauces, which may mask its subtle yet delicious flavour. Tiny grilled cutlets (about 6 per person) are fabulous served with a few roasted red peppers.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">
<em>Cordero Pascual</em>
 (Easter lamb), up to 1 year old, has deeper pink flesh, is not quite as tender as <em>ternasco</em>
 but has a wonderful depth of flavour. Leaner cuts are ideal for roasting and grilling whilst the neck, shoulder and shanks make fabulous stews and hotpots.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">
<em>Carnero</em>
 or <em>Oveja</em>
 (mutton), from animals of over 1 year old, is a bargain in Spain where younger, more delicate meat is preferred. Yet, the deep red flesh is ideal for some stews where long slow cooking will tenderize the tougher meat, and ingredients such as paprika and vinegar will counterbalance the stronger flavour.</span>

<p class="nonindent">It is no coincidence that this combination of meat and fruit may sound more like a recipe for a Moroccan tagine than a Spanish stew: it harks back to the time of the Moors. You could add some cumin, cinnamon and saffron for a more aromatic touch but this dish from Valencia really allows the flavour of the lamb to predominate. You will need to soak the beans overnight, although you could always cheat with ready-cooked beans from the market, or the can, for this recipe. Serving is easier if the leg has been boned and tied.</p>

<p class="extract">Meanwhile, season the lamb with salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil in a large terracotta <em>cazuela</em>
 or cast-iron casserole and brown the lamb. Add the onions and cook until golden before adding the garlic and paprika. Once you can smell the garlic’s wonderful aroma it is time to add the stock.</p>
<p class="extract">Cover the pan and simmer gently, turning the lamb over after about 30 minutes. Alternatively, you could place in an oven preheated to 170°C/325°F/Gas Mark 3.</p>
<p class="extract">After an hour add the potatoes to the lamb. To be truly authentic you should add the green beans at this stage too, but I prefer mine less cooked.</p>
<p class="extract">Once the potatoes are beginning to soften add the pears together with the drained beans and green beans, if you chose not to add them before, and cook for a further 20 minutes.</p>

Carefully arranged displays of heads, tongues, trotters and testicles may seem a little daunting, if not terrifying, to the novice chef, or spectator for that matter.

<strong>Which type of kidney?</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent5">
<span class="gray">Calves, <em>ternera</em>
, or lambs, <em>cordero</em>
, kidneys are the mildest in flavour and the most tender, ideal for sautéing or grilling. Meanwhile, those of the pig, <em>cerdo</em>
, or ox, <em>buey</em>
, have a stronger taste and can be a little tough and so are more suited to slow cooked meaty stews.</span>
</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Buying and preparing kidneys</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent5">
<span class="gray">Kidneys should be as fresh as possible, ideally removed from the fat, or suet, that surrounds them by the butcher as you buy them. They should look firm and shiny.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">Cook the kidneys straight away as they can gain an unpleasant ammonia taste and smell if left to hang around.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">Pig or ox kidney is often soaked for about 30 minutes in water with a tablespoon of vinegar or lemon juice to remove any ammonia flavour. However, very fresh lambs’ or calves’ kidneys do not require this treatment.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">

, fighting bull meat, is available across the river at the nearby Mercado de Triana. The fastidious rearing and feeding of these powerful animals is a sure guarantee of fully flavoured meat. However, you may decide that the butcher’s standard <em>rabo de buey</em>

</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 bay leaves</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>a small sprig of fresh thyme</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 cloves</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 bottle of red wine</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Season the flour with salt and pepper, then dust the oxtail pieces with the mixture.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat the olive oil in a large cast-iron casserole and brown the oxtail a few at a time. Set aside as soon as they are browned. If the pan becomes dark and the oil is in any danger of burning deglaze the casserole (see below) between batches of meat.</p>
<p class="extract">Next, using the same oil, fry the onions, carrots, leeks and garlic over a low heat until soft and golden.</p>
<p class="extract">Add the bay leaves, thyme, cloves and wine and return the oxtail to the pan. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and simmer over an extremely low heat for about 3 hours, or until the meat is meltingly tender and falling off the bone. You may prefer to cook the oxtail in an oven preheated to 140°C/275°F/Gas Mark 1 and take the dog for a walk. Season before serving.</p>

<strong>Tip</strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Locals would eat this dish alone with bread but should you choose to serve it with mashed potatoes or rice it will easily stretch to feed six people.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Deglazing</strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When searing meat for any stew or casserole you want to make the most of all the wonderful caramelized flavours on the bottom of the pan. The danger when dealing with multiple batches of meat is that the sediment and juices will burn before the browning job is done. So, between batches, just add a little wine or water to the pan and bring it up to the boil, loosening all the delicious bits. Reserve this liquid as stock for the dish, add a little more oil to the pan and continue to brown the meat.</p>

<strong>Veal and beef in Spain</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent5">
<span class="gray">
<em>Ternera</em>
 literally means veal, but this not the very young milk-fed variety, but pink meat from calves of anything up to ten months old. <em>Ternera</em>
 is immensely popular in Spain. The scarcer milk-fed veal or <em>ternera lechal</em>
 is available at a premium from the region of Ávila.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">
<em>Carne de Añojo</em>
 refers to the lean and tender meat or young beef, or yearling. Most beef, unless otherwise stated, will be in this category. The meat will be used for dishes such as <em>rosbif</em>
 or for simple steaks.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">
<em>Carne de buey</em>
 is less common and refers to meat from cattle of over two years of age, with deep red meat that requires plenty of hanging. Recipes such as the braised oxtail (see left) would ideally use this age of meat. The <em>carne de toro de lidia</em>
, or fighting bull meat falls into this category too.</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;veal cutlets or escalopes</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Lush grazing for cattle is extremely precious in Spain and, with the pasturelands of the north supporting mainly dairy herds, there is little space for maturing beef cattle. Most animals destined for the pot are slaughtered young and veal or <em>ternera</em>
 is always available in the market. Breaded or simply fried slices of veal are served in restaurants and households all over Spain.</p>

<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_19">breaded veal escalopes</h1>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 x 150 g/5 oz veal chops or escalopes</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>juice of ½ lemon</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 egg, beaten with 1 tbsp water</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>5 tbsp fresh breadcrumbs</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3–4 tbsp olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>½ lemon, cut into wedges</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Begin by flattening the slices of veal with a wooden mallet or rolling pin, be gentle or you will end up with something resembling steak tartar. Season the meat with the lemon juice, salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="extract">Now set up your production line: place the egg in a shallow dish, mix the breadcrumbs and parsley together and spread the mixture out on a large plate. First dip the veal in the egg and then turn in the breadcrumb mixture to coat thoroughly. The veal is now ready to go. If you want to get ahead of yourself you can prepare the meat to this point a few hours in advance.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat the olive oil in a large shallow frying pan and fry the veal gently until golden. If the oil is too hot you will burn the crust before the meat has cooked at all.</p>
<p class="extract">Serve at once with wedges of lemon. The meat is usually served alone or with a few chips, but you could accompany it with a simple tomato and garlic salad (see page 148).</p>

<p class="extract">Pour over the stock and wine and boil until the liquid has reduced to a couple of tablespoons. Season with salt and pepper to taste. The sauce may be prepared ahead of time, if you prefer.</p>
<p class="extract">Meanwhile, you can prepare the veal. Flatten the meat carefully with a mallet or rolling pin, taking care not to tear the flesh and season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat the olive oil in a large shallow pan, add the meat and fry quickly. You may have to do this in 2 batches so have a warm plate at the ready.</p>
<p class="extract">Serve the veal with the sweet onions and some good bread or perhaps a spoonful of mashed potato to soak up the juices.</p>

<p class="ingreds">

</p>
<p class="extract">Place the minced meat in a large bowl with 1 tsp salt, the pepper, nutmeg, garlic, sherry, parsley and breadcrumbs and set aside for a couple of hours, if you have time, to let the flavours to develop.</p>
<p class="extract">Add the egg yolks to the meat and mix everything together, I like to use my fingers, ensuring that everything is well blended. In a separate clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until light and fluffy.</p>
<p class="extract">Roll a small ball of the mixture and fry in a little olive oil until brown. Taste and adjust the seasoning until you are happy.</p>
<p class="extract">Next shape the rest of the meat into walnut-sized balls. Tip your flour onto a wide tray and roll the meatballs first in the flour before dipping them in the egg white.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat the olive oil in a large pan and fry the meatballs in batches over a medium heat, shaking the pan from time to time to roll them over. As soon as they are browned and appetizing (they will continue to cook later) remove them from the pan and set aside.</p>
<p class="extract">Now it’s time to make the sauce. Check the pan, if the oil looks too dark and burnt begin again, but ideally use the same pan with all its delicious meat juices to fry the onions until soft and translucent, then add the garlic and cook until just golden.</p>
<p class="extract">Add the tomatoes, stock and bay leaf and cook until the sauce is thoroughly combined and reduced a little. Season with the paprika and salt to taste. You may like to add a spoonful of honey if the sauce is acidic rather than sweet.</p>
<p class="extract">Add the meatballs to the sauce and cook until just firm.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Variations</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent5">
<span class="gray">You could make the meatballs using minced lamb, with cinnamon and a good pinch of dried cumin instead of the nutmeg. Substitute the sherry with lemon juice.</span>

<span class="gray">The tomato sauce could be zipped up too with a generous handful of freshly chopped mint or coriander and a good sprinkling of hot paprika. Serve this version with wedges of fresh lemon.</span>

<strong>Tips</strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You may like to zap the dish under the grill for a moment or two for a really deliciously browned cheese topping.</p>
<p class="extract">The dish can be completely assembled ahead of time and then baked just before serving. Remember to add an extra 5–10 minutes to the cooking time if it is coming straight from a cold refrigerator.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Variations</strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The pork liver pâté is a trick of Isabel Jiménez’s, the Cirera family’s cook, and it certainly seems to give these <em>Macarrones</em>
 the edge. However, do feel free to leave it out if you are throwing the dish together and have none to hand.</p>
<p class="extract">Mushrooms could be added to the dish. Add them to the pan after the meat.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Pasta</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent5">
<span class="gray">Pasta dishes are popular in Spain particularly Catalonia, a region that absorbed a great wave of Italian immigrants in the 19th century. <em>Canalones</em>
, Canneloni, have become a classic dish of the Catalan kitchen served in many a respected restaurant, while the less exalted plate of <em>macarrones</em>
 is more likely to make its way onto the <em>menú del dia</em>
, or set menu at the local bar.</span>
