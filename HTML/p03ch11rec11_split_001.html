<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">The meatballs take some time, but they are worth it. Instead of frying them, you can turn them under the broiler until they are brown all over. Use fresh peeled (see page 130), frozen, or vacuum-packed chestnuts. You can start the dish in advance and continue half an hour before you are ready to serve.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4</span></p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">8 country-style pork spareribs</p>
<p class="qun">1 medium onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="qun">3 garlic cloves, crushed to a paste or finely chopped</p>
<p class="qun">4 tomatoes, peeled and chopped</p>
<p class="qun">A good pinch of saffron threads</p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon <span class="italic">pimentón dulce</span> (or sweet paprika)</p>
<p class="qun">⅓ cup dried currants or raisins</p>
<p class="qun">4 cups chicken stock (or 4 cups water plus 1½ bouillon cubes)</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">2 cups fresh peeled, defrosted frozen, or vacuum-packed chestnuts</p>
<p class="qun">2 cups medium-grain Spanish paella rice or risotto rice, such as Arborio or Carnaroli</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE MEATBALLS</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 pound ground pork</p>
<p class="qun">1 large egg, lightly beaten</p>
<p class="qun">6 tablespoons fresh bread crumbs, soaked in ¼ cup milk</p>
<p class="qun">2 to 3 tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley</p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon cinnamon</p>
<p class="qun">¾ teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="qun">Pepper</p>
<p class="qun">Flour for dredging</p>
<p class="qun1">Olive or sunflower oil for frying</p>
<p class="recsum">Heat the oil in a large <span class="italic">cazuela,</span> or casserole. Sauté the spareribs, in batches if necessary, over low heat for 10 to 12 minutes, turning them once to brown them lightly all over. Remove them.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Sauté the onion in the same oil until it begins to color. Add the garlic and stir for a moment or two, until the aroma rises. Add the tomatoes and cook over high heat until they are reduced to a jammy sauce.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Stir in the saffron, <span class="italic">pimentón</span> (or paprika), and currants or raisins, and pour in the stock (or water and bouillon cubes). Return the spareribs to the pot, add a little salt, and cook, covered, for about 20 minutes, or until they are tender.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Meanwhile, for the meatballs, put the ground pork, egg, bread crumbs soaked in milk, and parsley in a bowl. Season with the cinnamon, salt, and pepper to taste and work to a soft paste with your hands.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Cover a platter with flour. Roll the meat mixture into balls the size of large walnuts. Roll them in the flour to coat them all over; shake off the excess. Fry them, in batches in about ½ inch of sizzling oil, in a large skillet over medium-high heat, turning them to brown them lightly all over. Drain on paper towels.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Half an hour before serving, bring the stock, with the spareribs, to a boil and add salt to taste. Put in the chestnuts and rice, stir very well, and bring to a boil again (do not stir again). Cook, covered, over high heat for 3 minutes, then reduce the heat to low and cook for another 7 minutes. Now place the meatballs on top of the rice, cover, and cook for 10 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the meatballs are cooked through.</p>
<p class="note"><span class="bold">Note:</span> Instead of frying the meatballs, you can put them on a sheet of foil on a baking tray and place them under the broiler, turning them until they are done.</p>
