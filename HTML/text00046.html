<i>Sunset</i>
 Magazine</a>
</h1>
<p class="pf">In the fall of 1961, immediately after returning from our year in Finland, Dick accepted an assistantship at Stanford to work on his PhD in geology. As we drove into Palo Alto, through Menlo Park, my heart leapt into my throat as we turned the corner toward Stanford Village, which was to be our home for the next three years. On that corner was a low-slung, lovely building surrounded by beautifully landscaped trees, shrubs, and flowers with the <i>Sunset</i>
 logo on the front. It was the most exotic setting I had ever seen!</p>
<p>The building in which <i>Sunset</i>
 magazine was housed was designed by Cliff May, a California architect best known for developing the postwar “dream home”—a ranch-style house with an indoor–outdoor feel, embracing the environment where the sun shines three hundred-plus days a year. The <i>Sunset</i>
 offices had a comfortable atmosphere, and even though each department was housed in a different “corner” of the open space, there remained a lot of privacy in the open office, and sounds didn’t carry from one desk to another.</p>
<p>I had been introduced to <i>Sunset</i>
 during the summer I worked as the cook at the elegant Sunshine Lake estate north of Duluth that belonged to Mrs. Whitney. <i>Sunset</i>
 at that time was available only for the western market, and it was an upscale publication with excellent, innovative food stories with recipes that were very well written and triple tested. I could never have imagined that I would have a chance at working for the magazine—my absolute dream job.</p>
<p>The assistantship Dick had been offered at Stanford covered only his expenses, so I knew I had to get a job. The next day I inquired about employment at <i>Sunset</i>
 and found that the food department needed a typist. I was so excited! I had the required degree in home economics, so I applied for and landed the job. It was like a dream come true.</p>
<p>I was given a desk and typewriter, plus an “in” and “out” basket into which the writers placed the rough copies of their stories and recipes. Within a month or two there was a vacancy within the department and I was promoted into the position of writer. I felt like the luckiest person in the world.</p>
<p>By typing the stories of the professionals in the department, I learned how to write recipes. It was wonderful on-the-job training. The pay—along with leftovers from the test kitchen—was enough to keep the family fed.</p>
<p>It was so exciting to be included in the planning meetings. I had ideas for zillions of stories, and soon I was given permission to write stories. What a thrill! In every planning session I threw out at least a half dozen ideas that were appropriate for the upcoming issue.</p>
<p>Even though there were demands not only from my student husband but also from our three- and five-year old children, I didn’t mind it because I was living my dream at <i>Sunset</i>
. It was the kind of job I had lusted for—the opportunity of a lifetime.</p>
<p>It was exciting to handle original typewritten copy by Helen Evans Brown, the revered culinary authority of the West Coast during the 1950s and 1960s. Her writing was always compelling and her ideas were fresh and new. Our policy was to test each recipe three times, and I felt honored to take hers into the <i>Sunset</i>
 test kitchens.</p>
<p>We had just returned from a year in Helsinki and I was pumped. Dick was spending long hours in the geology department at Stanford and the kids were pooped after spending their days tearing around University Village under the watchful eye of a neighbor who, of course, I paid by the hour. They were in bed early, so I usually had the evening to myself.</p>
<p>At the same time, I had my boxful of notes and recipes from Finland to work on in the evenings and on weekends. Going through what I had gathered in Finland was fun. From that work, I presented the idea for my first book, <i>The Finnish Cookbook,</i>
 to Proctor Melquist, the editor in chief of <i>Sunset.</i>
 But it wasn’t the type of book the magazine’s parent company, Lane Publishing, would publish. However, Proc had connections in New York. We presented the idea and eventually Herbert Michelman at Crown Publishers was enthusiastic and wanted to add my book to Crown’s international cookbook series. It was first published in 1964 and is still in print these many years later.</p>
