<h4><span class="red">pan</span></h4>
<p class="running_first">Flip open a book of Spanish <em>refranes</em> (refrains) and by far the most common food word used is <em>pan</em>—bread. (One recent search turned up 169 refrains with <em>pan</em>.) There is just simply nothing more fundamental than bread. These sayings range from the commonly uttered <em>“al pan, pan y al vino, vino”</em> (to call “bread <em>bread</em> and wine <em>wine</em>,” essentially to call something by what it is, as in to “call a spade a spade”), to referring to someone as <em>“un trozo de pan”</em> (a piece of bread), which means a very good person.</p>
<p class="running_first">There are about as many types of bread in Spain as there are refrains, from classic large, round country loaves to long, thin <em>barras de pan</em> (the word <em>barra</em> means “bar” or “rod”). Larger loaves are asked for by weight in the bakery, as in <em>un cuarto</em>, referring to a quarter of a kilo, or <em>una barra de medio</em>, referring to a half kilo loaf. Galician breads often include a bit of corn flour to keep them moist, while along the Mediterranean there is the wonderful <em>coca de pan</em>, a dense, and slightly chewy flat loaf rubbed with olive oil and sprinkled with salt flakes before being baked.</p>
<p class="running_first">Bread is seldom made at home, but rather bought in the bakery. And while day-old bread is rarely thrown away—there are numerous recipes that utilize it in this book—buying fresh bread every day remains important.</p>
<p class="running_first"><em>“Bueno es pan, y mejor, con algo que agregar</em>.”—Bread is good, but better with something to go with it. Sometimes that means on the side, but other times it means cooked on top. <em>Cocas</em> are a flatbread popular in Catalunya topped with roasted peppers <a href="49-chapter28.html#page_70">(see page 70)</a>, herring, spinach, or whatever can be rustled up and added. (Cocas can also be sweet; <a href="204-chapter147.html#page_289">see page 289</a> for one with sugar, pine nuts, and anisette.)</p>
<p class="running_first">Of course, old bread is not thrown away. Made from day-old bread, <em>migas</em> <a href="112-chapter78.html#page_161">(see page 161)</a>—which can be translated as “crumbs” and refers to the soft interior part of a loaf—is a famous shepherd’s dish prepared with chorizo, bacon, and garlic, and often eaten with a fried egg. Substantial and filling, migas and a glass of red wine are about all that is needed for a day’s work.</p>
<p class="running_first">Or, as an old refrain goes, <em>“Con pan y vino se anda el camino”</em> (With bread and wine the trail can be walked). Shepherds know that one well.</p>
