<h1 class="chapter">chestnut &amp; potato gnocchi</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>Gnocchi are best made with potatoes that are neither too fluffy nor too smooth, and the Italians say they should be boiled in their skins so that the water doesn’t saturate them. The secret to light gnocchi is to trap as much air inside as you can by pushing the cooked potatoes through a sieve, <i>passatutto</i> (food mill) or ricer. Freezing gnocchi before they are cooked can give an even better result than cooking from fresh, as they tend to hold their shape better. If you are not following a gluten-free diet, you can use ‘00’ flour instead of chestnut flour if you prefer. Chestnut flour is naturally sweet and therefore the gnocchi lend themselves to a hearty meat ragù such as <a href="9781784881757_Split100.html#page_171">memmo’s beef ragù</a>, or a simple sauce such as the butter and sage sauce in <a href="9781784881757_Split106.html#page_182">large ravioli filled with spinach &amp; an egg yolk</a>.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 4 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>500 g (1 lb 2 oz) fluffy potatoes, such as Desiree or King Edward, unpeeled</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>75 g (2½ oz/scant ⅔ cup) chestnut or ‘00’ flour</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 teaspoon fine salt, plus extra for the cooking water</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>freshly ground black pepper, to taste</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 egg, plus 1 egg yolk, beaten</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil. Add the potatoes and cook them in their skins until tender – this may take up to 1 hour, depending on their size, but don’t be tempted to cut them or they become watery. Remove the potatoes (don’t drain away the cooking water) and peel them while they are still hot by holding a potato in one hand with a fork or a cloth and peeling away its skin with a knife in the other hand. Reserve the potato cooking water to cook the gnocchi.</p>
<p class="tx">Pass the potatoes through a sieve, ricer or food mill into a large bowl. Use a large metal spoon to fold in 50 g (2 oz/scant ½ cup) of the flour, the salt and pepper and the beaten eggs. Try to keep the movements light and brief to trap air in the mixture and form into a dough.</p>
<p class="tx">Scatter the remaining flour onto the work surface and use your hands to make long sausages from the dough around 2 cm (¾ in) wide. Cut the sausages into 2 cm (¾ in) lengths.</p>
<p class="tx">Bring the saucepan of reserved potato water to the boil, adding more hot water if necessary and a couple of teaspoons of salt. Drop in the gnocchi and cook for 2–4 minutes: when they bob up to the surface they are done. Drain well and toss into your chosen sauce, heated in a large frying pan.</p>
<p class="tx">If you plan to freeze your gnocchi before cooking, spread them out on a well-floured baking tray, making sure they don’t touch each other, and put the tray in the freezer. When frozen, shake off any excess flour and transfer the gnocchi to a freezer bag to take up less space. Use within 3 months. To cook from frozen, allow an extra 1–2 minutes’ cooking time.</p>
