<p class="author1"><span class="txit">pizza ripiena</span></p>
<p class="noindent">My grandmother Nonna Tropiano made these stuffed pizzas for large family gatherings to be eaten as an appetizer. She would buy an eight- to ten-pound ham, boil it for fifteen to twenty minutes, trim away any fat, then dice enough meat into cubes to use as a filling for three or four pizza ripiene. Soppressata or diced ham steaks may be substituted.</p>
<p class="indentb">This pie may be refrigerated for one day. Bring it to room temperature or reheat before serving.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 package dry yeast or 1 cake fresh yeast</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cups warm water</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 cups all-purpose flour</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons cornmeal</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 cups <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>-inch cubes smoked ham</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cups ricotta cheese (about 1 pound)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup finely grated pecorino Romano cheese</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>-inch cubes mozzarella cheese (about <sup class="sup">3</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> pound)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 large eggs, lightly beaten</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> In a measuring cup, combine the yeast with <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup of the warm water. Stir until the yeast dissolves.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture. Begin by mixing with a fork and then by hand while adding enough of the remaining 1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups water to form a soft, dry dough. The dough may be prepared in a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Dough prepared this way may require less water.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and continue mixing it with your hands. Knead to form a smooth dough, adding more flour as necessary to keep the dough from being too sticky. Form into a ball and place in a clean bowl. Cover the bowl loosely with a clean dish towel. Set it aside in a warm place and allow the dough to rise until it has doubled in size, about 2 hours.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_105"/><span class="red">4.</span> Preheat the oven to 350° F. Sprinkle a large (about 9 x15-inch) baking sheet with the cornmeal and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> In a large bowl, mix together the ham, ricotta, Romano, and mozzarella. Mix in the eggs. Season with pepper and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">6.</span> Divide the risen dough in half. Roll one half of the dough on a lightly floured surface into a rectangle that is slightly larger than the baking sheet. Transfer the rolled dough to the baking sheet. Spread the filling evenly over the dough to within 1 inch of the edge.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">7.</span> Roll the second half of the dough on a lightly floured work surface into a rectangle that will fit on top of the pie. Place it on top of the filled dough in the baking sheet. Gently press the two layers together. Trim away any thick portions of dough to create an even edge. Use the tines of a fork to completely seal the edges.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">8.</span> Bake until the dough is golden brown on the top and bottom, about 1 hour. Allow to cool slightly and set before serving, about 30 minutes.</p>
