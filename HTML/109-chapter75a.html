<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">This is the mac and cheese of Spain, the dish that, as every Spanish grandmother (and restaurant cook) knows, kids love and will be sure to finish. And perhaps because it’s a kids’ favorite—kids grow up after all—it’s beloved by adults, too. To offer more savory, robust flavors, cut the nutmeg and cinnamon and add some finely chopped pieces of Spanish chorizo to the sofrito.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3 TABLESPOONS EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL</li>
<li>8 OUNCES/225 G FRESH PORK SAUSAGE, SQUEEZED FROM THE CASING AND PINCHED INTO MARBLE-SIZE PIECES (SEE NOTE)</li>
<li>1 MEDIUM ONION, FINELY CHOPPED</li>
<li>4 RIPE MEDIUM TOMATOES, HALVED CROSSWISE, SEEDED, AND GRATED <a href="243-chapter179.html#page_339">(SEE PAGE 339)</a></li>
<li>1 OR 2 PINCHES FRESHLY GRATED NUTMEG</li>
<li>1 OR 2 PINCHES GROUND CINNAMON</li>
<li>SALT</li>
<li>14 OUNCES/400 G PENNE OR ANOTHER TUBULAR PASTA</li>
<li>1 TABLESPOON BUTTER, CUT INTO SMALL PIECES</li>
<li>1 CUP/70 G LOOSELY PACKED, FRESHLY GRATED MILD PASTA CHEESE, SUCH AS MOZZARELLA</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> In a cazuela, heavy casserole, large sauté pan, or deep skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the sausage and brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a plate. In the same oil, prepare a sofrito with the onion and tomatoes, following the directions on <a href="25-boxnote05.html#page_39">page 39</a>.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> When the sofrito is ready, stir in the nutmeg and cinnamon, season with salt, return the sausage and any juices to the pan, and add ¼ cup/60 ml water to loosen the sauce. Cook for 5 minutes, or until the sausage is hot and cooked through.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Meanwhile, in a large pot, bring 4 quarts/4 L water to a boil and season with salt. Add the pasta and cook, stirring from time to time to keep the pasta from clumping together, until al dente (follow the time indicated on the pasta package).</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Meanwhile, preheat the broiler.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Drain the pasta in a colander but do not rinse. Shake off any water that clings to the pasta. Return the pasta to the pot, spoon over the sofrito, and turn to blend well. Transfer to a large ovenproof baking dish. Place the butter around the top and evenly sprinkle over the cheese. Broil until the cheese is melted and golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve immediately.</p>
<p class="tip"><span class="red"><span class="font2">NOTE:</span></span> Be sure the pork sausages are not sweetened breakfast links.</p>
