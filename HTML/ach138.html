<p class="author1"><span class="txit">brasato al barolo</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In Italy it is possible to find inexpensive Barolo wines that are perfect to cook with. Unfortunately, that is not the case in America. Because you don’t want to pour a fifteen-dollar bottle of wine over a four-dollar piece of meat, I recommend cooking with a flavorful inexpensive red wine and reserving the Barolo to serve with dinner. For tender, flavorful meat, it is best to prepare this dish several hours or, even better, a full day ahead of time. Reheat it in the oven before serving with mashed potatoes or polenta.</p>
<p class="indentb">I begin this recipe by preparing a <span class="txit">sacchétto di spezie,</span> a little bag of herbs and spices.</p>

<p class="noindentqa">Combine all the ingredients in the center of a piece of cheesecloth that is large enough to hold the herb sprigs, and tie in a bundle with butcher’s string.</p>
<p class="noindentq"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">TO PREPARE THE POT ROAST</span>:</span></p>
<p class="noindentqa"><span class="red">1.</span> Preheat the oven to 350° F.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Season the beef with salt and pepper, then lightly dust with flour. Melt the butter in a large (6-quart) flameproof casserole set over medium-high heat. When it is foaming, add the beef and brown it on all sides, 5 minutes. Add the celery, onions, carrots, and sacchétto di spezie. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables soften slightly, about 2 minutes. Raise the heat to high and add the bottle of wine. Cook until <a id="page_271"/>the wine begins to boil, about 2 more minutes, skimming off any fat that rises to the surface.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Strain the porcini mushrooms through a fine-mesh sieve, reserving the liquid. Rinse the mushrooms under cold running water to remove any grit, and add them to the casserole along with the strained mushroom liquid, tomato paste, and tomatoes. The liquid should just cover the meat. If it does not, add chicken broth or water. Cover the casserole and bake it in the oven until the meat is cooked through and tender, about 2 hours. Remove the meat from the casserole to a cutting board, cover with aluminum foil, and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve and discard the vegetables and herb bag. Pour the broth back into the casserole and set it over high heat. Bring to a boil and add the arrowroot and the <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup wine. Cook to reduce and thicken the liquid, about 5 minutes. Carve the meat into <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub>-inch-thick slices. Serve immediately, spooning some of the broth over each portion.</p>
