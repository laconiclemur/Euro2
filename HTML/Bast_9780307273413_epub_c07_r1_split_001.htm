Overshadowed by its sibling, Tuscany, Umbria is like the timid child who has been hiding its beauty and its treasures. But now the world is listening and discovering the beauty of its undulating mountains, and its cities where art and music abound, particularly works from Etruscan and medieval times, as well as Renaissance art, rivaling what can be found in any city in Italy. Equally alluring is the cuisine, which reflects the generosity of the land. The intense aromas and flavors of the Norcino, considered the best black truffle in Italy, whether grated on top of <em class="calibre4">strangozzi</em>, a handmade chunky spaghetti, or made into a paste with butter and anchovies and spread on a crostino, make for an unforgettable eating experience. The best lentils in Italy—sweet, meaty, and flavorful—are the small ones from Castelluccio, a medieval town perched on top of a hill in the middle of a plain high in the Sibylline Mountains.</p>

  <p class="indent">The Sibylline Mountains, since 1993 a national park, are part of the central Apennines, situated between Umbria and Le Marche. In Roman times, these mountains were the haunt of Sibyl, the enchantress who lured travelers to their doom. Today, the park is full of wildlife, but is most spectacular in June, with its extraordinary display of wildflowers. When I was visiting there in June 2006, I literally landed from the sky into this kaleidoscope of flowers. My friend Anselmi, an extraordinary producer of wine in the Veneto, had to go there himself to visit Marco Caprai, a fellow wine producer, and had offered to take me with him. The blades of the helicopter were humming before I could put on my jacket, and off we went. As we were approaching from the heavens, we could see Castelluccio firmly ensconced on the hill, while on the plain millions of flowers in every color of the spectrum were swaying in the breeze, and beautiful horses galloped through the pastures, their shining manes flowing in the wind. It seemed as if Sibyl might appear any minute to mount them.</p>

  <p class="indent">The Apennine Mountains are also a great source of wild meats—boar, hare, pheasants, and others. The Umbrians are known for their skills as butchers, sausage-makers, and curers of <a class="calibre8" id="page185"></a>meats, especially pork. As you travel through Italy, you may notice butcher shops called <em class="calibre4">norcinerie</em>, meaning that they only handle pork meat.</p>

  <p class="indent">But chicken is also appreciated in Umbria, especially when paired with ripe grapes in season, which was a serendipitous find for me on one of my visits to Gubbio with my son-in-law, Corrado Manuali, whose family hails from there.</p>

  <p class="indent">Corrado’s grandmother Giuseppina Radicchi and grandfather Giuseppe Manuali were born on two opposite hills surrounding Gubbio. They met in the winter of 1922, when Giuseppina was standing in the snow, her shoes in shreds, and Giuseppe noticed her shivering feet and fell in love. They married and had three children, one of them being Gianfranco, Corrado’s father. Corrado always reminisces nostalgically about the summers he spent with Nonna Giuseppina in Gubbio when he and Giuseppe, the caretaker’s son, would play on the <em class="calibre4">funivia</em>, the tram that goes up to the top. Today, Giuseppe owns one of the best restaurants in Gubbio, La Fornace di Mastro Giorgio, where local specialties are featured.</p>

  <p class="indent">One of my favorite eateries in all of Umbria—to which I make a pilgrimage almost every summer with Corrado, Tanya, and Lorenzo and Julia (their kids, my grandchildren)—is a bakery–trattoria–truck stop called Il Panaro, near Gubbio. We drive there for the <em class="calibre4">torta al testo</em> (or <em class="calibre4">crescia</em>, as it known locally), a freshly baked bread resembling focaccia, split and stuffed with a choice of savory fillings: prosciutto or sausages; or pecorino, ricotta, or stracchino; or meat and cheese together; or foraged seasonal greens, braised with garlic.</p>

  <p class="indent">It is not just the delicious <em class="calibre4">crescia</em> that draws me back to Il Panaro year after year. I love the setting, perched on a little hill, just off the highway, where you always see a line of parked trucks. Hidden behind trees is the wood-burning oven where the <em class="calibre4">crescia</em> bakes, as well as the long wooden tables at which the truck drivers and other guests sit, waiting for their <em class="calibre4">torte.</em> Being outside and basking in the Umbrian scenery, with the smell of the charcoal in the air and a light taste of ash on the tongue, I am filled with a wonderful sense of family and of the heritage of food from one generation to another.</p>

  <p class="indent">Any direction you look in Umbria, your eyes are bound to fall on olive trees. The cultivation of the olive in Umbria goes back to the first century <span class="small1">B.C.</span> Today, it is a very important part of the regional economy, and Umbria produces some of the most prized olive oil in Italy. The climatic condition of this region allows the olives to mature slowly, so their flavor is intensified while the acidity is kept low.</p>

  <p class="center"><a class="calibre8" id="page186"></a><img alt="" class="calibre16" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_064_r1.jpg" /></p>

  <p class="figure1"><em class="calibre4">Filled Focaccia—Torta al Testo</em></p>

  <p class="indent"><a class="calibre8" id="page187"></a>Where there is olive oil there is wine, and Umbria has long been renowned for its white wine Orvieto, a crispy, easy-to-drink, food-friendly wine. But ever more red wine is taking center stage in Umbria these days, especially Torgiano Rosso and Sagrantino. The Lungarotti family has been producing wonderful wines for generations in Torgiano. Since Giorgio Lungarotti, the patriarch, passed on, his two daughters, Teresa Severini and Chiara Lungarotti, run the company, while their creative mother, Maria Grazia, an art historian, is responsible for the wine-and-olive-oil museum at the Tre Vaselle, the family-run hospitality center.</p>

  <p class="indent">The new visionary and revolutionary award-winning winemaker in Umbria today is Marco Caprai. In 1998, I went to Montefalco to visit Arnaldo Caprai, Marco’s father. I heard that he had begun making wines, and I was especially interested in a new local variety that he was vinifying, Sagrantino. But as we talked over lunch, I felt his heart was more in the quality linen-and-lace business he ran. Not so his son Marco, who has all that it takes to make great wines, and is credited for producing consistently award-winning, world-class wines from Umbria. It is now said that Marco Caprai is bigger than life, and Sagrantino is his revolutionary product.</p>

  <p class="extract">This savory, thick lentil spread is a great topping for a crostino, especially when made with tiny, firm <em class="calibre4">lenticchie di Castelluccio</em>, which give the mouth-feel of caviar. It can also serve as a fine side dish for any grilled meat, or as the base for risotto or soup. Then again, with the addition of crumbled sausage, it would make a great pasta sauce. So get creative: make a double batch of the lentil topping here, and have fun with all the leftovers.</p>

    <p class="nonindent"><span class="small">RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT:</span> A heavy-bottomed saucepan, 3-to-4-quart capacity, with a cover; a large heavy skillet or sauté pan</p>
  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Rinse the lentils, and put them in the saucepan with the celery, bay leaves, and 3 cups cold water. Bring to a boil, cover the pan, and adjust the heat to maintain a gentle, steady simmer. Cook until the lentils are almost tender, about 20 minutes (or longer, depending on size).</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Meanwhile, pour 4 tablespoons of the olive oil into the skillet, and set it over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and onion, and cook for 5 minutes or more, until the onion is soft and glistening. Drop the peperoncino into a hot spot in the pan, and let it toast for a minute, then stir in the crushed tomatoes, season with 1 teaspoon salt, and bring the sauce to a simmer. Let it bubble gently about 5 minutes, until slightly thickened.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When the lentils are just slightly undercooked, pour into their pan all the tomato sauce from the skillet, and stir into the lentils. Return the sauce to the simmer, and cook, partially covered, until the lentils are fully cooked and tender, about 10 minutes. Remove the cover, stir in the remaining teaspoon salt, and let the lentils cook slowly, stirring frequently, until they’re very thick and starting to fall apart, another 10 minutes or so. Remove the pan from the heat, and stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> I prefer the lentils hot or warm as a crostini topping or <em class="calibre4">contorno</em>, but they are very good at room temperature, too. For crostini, grill or toast the bread slices, spoon a mound of lentils on each crostino, and drizzle on a bit of fine olive oil.<br class="calibre1" />

  <p class="extract">You don’t need complicated dishes to enjoy the wonderful flavor and aroma of black truffle—bread and butter will do, as this easy recipe proves. Fresh black truffle, if available, always makes great truffle butter. And fresh Norcino truffle, the Umbrian variety plentiful in season around the city of Norcia, considered the finest black truffle in Italy, makes the very best butter. Fresh is always better, but you can use a good-quality jarred Umbrian black truffle. Black truffle from other countries like France is good as well. It’s sold by many specialty-food stores and Internet vendors, at a range of prices.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Preheat oven to 350°. Lay the bread slices flat on a baking sheet, and toast them in the oven for 4 minutes, turn the slices over, and toast for another 4 minutes or so, until they’re light gold. Cool the toasts on a wire rack.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> If using a fresh truffle, brush it clean with a kitchen towel or vegetable brush. With a sharp vegetable peeler, shave off any tough bits from the exterior of the truffle (save these for sauces or other cooked dishes). Jarred truffles will be ready to use, without cleaning or trimming.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Grate the truffle on the fine holes of a grater, reserving a small solid piece. Put the butter and anchovies in the mini–food processor, and pulse until smooth. Fold in the grated truffle.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Spread the butter on the cooled crostini. Grate the reserved piece of truffle over the crostini, giving each one a dusting of truffle. Serve immediately.</p>

  <p class="extract">Here’s my version of our family’s favorite Umbrian road food: the <em class="calibre4">torta al testo</em> (or <em class="calibre4">crescia</em>) baked and served at Il Panaro, the outdoor eatery and truck stop near Gubbio (see this chapter’s introduction). The unique wood-oven-baked character of the Il Panaro <em class="calibre4">torta</em> is hard to replicate in the home kitchen, yet I’ve found that baking the breads in a cast-iron skillet gives very nice results. The dough is easy to mix and shape, so even if you’re a bread-baking novice you’ll have success with this one.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Dissolve the yeast in ¼ cup warm water in a small bowl; let it sit for several minutes, until it starts to bubble. Put the flour and salt in the bowl of the food processor, and pulse for a few seconds to blend.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Combine the dissolved yeast with a cup of warm water. With the processor running, pour all the liquid into the flour. Process until the dough clumps on the blade and cleans the sides of the bowl, about 20 seconds. Process another 20 seconds, for a total of about 40 seconds. (If the dough does not gather on the blade or process easily, it is too wet or dry. Feel the dough, then work in more flour or warm water, in small amounts.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Turn the dough out on a lightly floured surface, and knead for a minute into a smooth round. Put it in a large, oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Put a rack in the bottom third of the oven, and heat it to 450°. Deflate the risen dough, and cut it in half. Flatten each piece into a round, about 9 inches in diameter, and lay each in a cast-iron skillet. Press and stretch the dough to fill the entire bottom of the pan, then dimple the top all over with your fingertips. (If you only have one suitable skillet, put one piece of dough back in the oiled bowl and let it rise again, covered, while you shape and bake the first <em class="calibre4">torta.</em> When the skillet is empty, deflate the second piece of dough, shape it, and bake it.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Bake the breads about 15 minutes, until light brown on top. Turn them out to cool on a wire rack. Another option is to cook it on top of the stove in the skillet over medium heat, flipping it several times until done, about 10 to 15 minutes.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To fill the <em class="calibre4">torte:</em> Slice off the top half of each with a long serrated knife, and cover the bottom with slices of prosciutto, grated cheese, sautéed greens, or a combination of these. Replace the tops of the <em class="calibre4">torte</em>, set them on a baking sheet, and return to the oven. Bake another 10 minutes or so, until the <em class="calibre4">torte</em> are golden and the fillings hot. (If you like, lift the top of the <em class="calibre4">torta</em> and scatter salad greens on the hot fillings, then cover.) Slice the <em class="calibre4">torte</em> into pieces or wedges and serve.</p>

  <p class="extract">In Umbria, small meatballs are often served simply, floating in a bowl of hot chicken broth. This is a fine custom, in my opinion: it makes the soup more special and substantial, and the broth enhances the carefully homemade meatballs. The diminutive pork-and-veal <em class="calibre4">polpette</em> in this recipe incorporate small amounts of plump raisins, pine nuts, and orange zest—delicate flavors that might be overwhelmed by bold pasta sauce but stand out in a spoonful of light, clear broth. You can either fry or poach the meatballs (the fried have more flavor; the poached are healthier), but either way they are delicious.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Crumble the ground pork and veal into a large bowl, breaking up any clumps with your fingers, and toss to mix them. Pour the beaten eggs over the meat, and scatter on top the bread crumbs, grated cheese, orange zest, chopped pine nuts and raisins, and salt. Fold and toss and squeeze the meat through your fingers to distribute all the ingredients evenly.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Scoop up a small amount of the meat mix—about a heaping teaspoon—and roll it in your palms to form a 1-inch ball (the size of a large grape). Set it on a tray lined with wax paper or parchment, and form the rest of the mixture into meatballs—you should have sixty or more. Now either fry or poach the meatballs, before final heating in stock for serving.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To fry the meatballs: Spread a good layer of flour on a large plate or tray. Pour a thin layer of vegetable oil in the skillet, and heat it slowly.</p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page193"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Dredge a batch of the meatballs in flour—twenty or thirty, depending on the size of your skillet. Roll each in the flour until coated, and set them all on a tray. Heat up the oil in the skillet over medium-high heat, and drop in the floured meatballs. Fry them for about 5 minutes, turning and moving them occasionally, until browned on all sides. Remove them to a tray or platter lined with paper towels. Repeat with the remaining meatballs, and brown them the same way. Between batches, remove browned bits from the skillet and add more oil as needed.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Alternatively, to poach the meatballs: Fill a big pot with 3 quarts of lightly salted water, bring it to a boil, and drop in half the meatballs. Cover the pot, and return the water to a boil quickly. Adjust the heat to keep the water simmering gently, and poach the meatballs, uncovered, about 5 minutes, until cooked through.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Lift them out with a spider or strainer, let drain briefly, and set them in a bowl in a warm spot. Poach the rest of the meatballs the same way, then discard the poaching water.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To serve: Heat the broth in the soup pot until simmering.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Fill warm soup bowls with broth and meatballs—six or more in each bowl—and serve while very hot, with plenty of freshly grated cheese at the table for sprinkling over the top.</p>

  <p class="extract">Here’s a typically simple, rustic pasta from Umbria, which would be made with seasonal local leafy greens, both cultivated and foraged wild varieties. Although we don’t have many of the same choices as in Italy, there are plenty of suitable leafy greens available in our American markets now. Certainly chard, spinach, and common chicory are delicious in this dish, and young beet, collard, dandelion, mustard, or turnip greens would be good, too.</p>

  <p class="indent">Many dried pastas are delicious with this dressing of greens, and I particularly like dried egg fettuccine (with its extra richness and color); gemelli and orecchiette are also good choices. And I <em class="calibre4">love</em> homemade fresh gnocchi with this sauce, too.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Wash the greens well, and pat them dry on towels. Cut off any tough stems, and coarsely chop the leaves into strips. You should have about 10 cups chopped greens.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour the olive oil into the skillet, and set over medium-high heat. Scatter in the garlic slices, and cook for a minute or two, until they’re sizzling and starting to color. Dump in all the greens, season with the salt and peperoncino, and toss and turn to coat them in oil. Cover the skillet, and cook until all the greens are wilted, turning and stirring them once or twice, 3 minutes or longer (depending on which greens you’re cooking).</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Stir the tomato paste into 1 cup hot water until blended, and pour it into the skillet. Bring it to a boil, then cover the pan and adjust the heat to maintain a steady bubbling simmer. Cook for about 15 minutes, until the greens are tender and the sauce has a good consistency for dressing pasta.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil (at least 6 quarts water with 1 tablespoon salt).

Cover the pot, return the water to a boil over high heat, then set the cover ajar and cook the pasta until barely <em class="calibre4">al dente.</em></p>

Toss pasta and sauce together for a minute or two, until the greens are distributed evenly in the fettuccine and the pasta strands are coated with moisture and fully cooked. If the greens are too dry, thin the sauce with as much as a cup of hot pasta water; if too soupy, thicken the sauce quickly over higher heat.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Turn off the heat, sprinkle a cup of grated cheese over the pasta, and toss well.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Let the peppers cool completely.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Put the drained peppers in a large bowl, and scatter on top the chopped anchovies, olives, capers, parsley, peperoncino, and garlic. Season with the remaining ¼ teaspoon salt, and drizzle over it the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil. Tumble and toss to coat everything well.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To cook the lentils: Set the saucepan over medium heat, and pour in the olive oil. Stir in the onion, carrot, celery, and garlic, and cook for 5 minutes or so, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened. Clear a spot in the bottom of the pan, drop in the tomato paste, and let it toast and caramelize in the hot spot for a minute or two, then stir it in with the vegetables.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Spill in the lentils, drop in the bay leaves, stir them around the pan, and pour in 6 cups cold water. Cover the pan, and bring the liquid to a boil over high heat, stirring now and then. Set the cover ajar, adjust the heat to keep the water bubbling gently, and cook for about 25 minutes, or until the lentils are tender to the bite though still quite soupy. Stir in the salt, and turn off the heat.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Meanwhile, wash the potatoes well and put them, whole and unpeeled, in a large pot. With enough cold water to cover them by about 2 inches, bring to a steady boil, and cook the potatoes just until they are easily pierced with a fork or sharp knife—don’t let them get mushy or fall apart. Drain, cool, and peel the potatoes, then cut them crosswise into ½-inch-thick rounds.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour 2 tablespoons of the olive oil into the big skillet, set it over medium-high heat, and stir in the mushrooms. Season them with ½ teaspoon salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, as liquid from the mushrooms is released and boils off. When the pan is dry and the mushrooms are browned and caramelized on the edges, take the skillet off the heat and scrape the mushrooms into a bowl.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour the remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil in the skillet, set it over medium heat, and stir in the leeks and garlic. Cook and stir until the leeks begin to soften, about 4 minutes, then lay all the potato slices in the pan; season with 1 teaspoon salt. With a wide spatula, turn the potato rounds over to coat them in oil. Let them cook and gradually take on color, turning them occasionally, until all the rounds are nicely golden, 8 minutes or so.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Scatter the mushrooms and grated cheese on the potatoes, and tumble to mix them in.

Cover the skillet with a big plate, and, holding them together with hot pads or towels, invert the skillet, dropping the potato cake onto the plate. Slide it back into the skillet and brown the second side, another 5 minutes. Slide the finished cake onto a cutting board.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Passionate as I am about pasta, especially fresh homemade pasta, in all its forms, it is always a thrill for me to discover a new recipe for dough, a new shape, or a new technique (not to mention dressings, which are truly infinite in their variety). And though I’ve been making fresh pasta since I was a child and studying the subject throughout my culinary career, my recent travels through Italy’s regions have added a few treasures to my list of favorite fresh pastas.</p>

  <p class="indent">One of these is the distinctive <em class="calibre4">strangozzi</em> (some say <em class="calibre4">stringozzi</em>) of Umbria. These long pasta strands are as different as can be from the rich and refined tagliatelle of Emilia-Romagna or the <em class="calibre4">tajarin</em> of Piemonte. <em class="calibre4">Strangozzi</em> are made from a plain dough of wheat flour, water, and salt (no egg, no olive oil) and rolled a bit thicker than usual. But they have a satisfying wheaty taste, and such substance and texture that eating <em class="calibre4">strangozzi</em> is a joy for any true pasta-lover.</p>

  <p class="indent">In this group of recipes, I share with you an easy formula for dough and a clever method for forming and unrolling long strands of <em class="calibre4">strangozzi</em> that I learned in Umbria. It is slightly complicated but very efficient—and lots of fun. Then you’ll find recipes for three typically tasty Umbrian sauces, delicious with <em class="calibre4">strangozzi</em> and with other pastas, too.</p>

If the dough does not gather on the blade or process easily, it is too wet or dry. Feel the dough, and add either more flour or more ice water, in small amounts.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Turn the dough out on a lightly floured surface, and knead by hand briefly, until it’s smooth, soft, and stretchy. Press it into a disk, wrap well in plastic wrap, and let it rest at room temperature for at least <a class="calibre8" id="page199"></a>½ hour. (Refrigerate the dough for up to a day, or freeze for a month or more. Defrost in the refrigerator, and return to room temperature before rolling.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Cut the dough in six equal pieces. Keeping it lightly floured, roll each piece through the machine at progressively thinner settings (but not to the thinnest setting), extending it into a strip about ⅛ inch thick, 20 inches long, and 5 inches wide (or as wide as your machine allows). Trim the edges so the rolled strips are even rectangles, and lay them flat on lightly floured trays or baking sheets. Dust the tops with flour, and cover loosely with a kitchen towel. Let the sheets dry for 15 to 30 minutes to make the next steps easier.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To form <em class="calibre4">strangozzi:</em> Lay out one pasta strip on the floured surface in front of you, and roll it up from <em class="calibre4">both</em> short ends, making two fairly tight coils that meet in the middle, like an old-fashioned scroll. With a very sharp knife, slice the scroll crosswise, down through both coils of dough, at ¼-inch intervals. From a 5-inch scroll, you should be able to cut about twenty cross sections; each one is a rolled-up strand of <em class="calibre4">strangozzi.</em></p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To unfurl the <em class="calibre4">strangozzi</em>, try this clever method that I learned in Umbria: After slicing the scroll, slide the long blade of a serrated knife (or similar thin blade) under the cut pieces, without separating them. Make sure that the knife edge runs exactly under the center line of the scroll, where the two coils meet.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Now lift the knife, and all the cut pieces, off the table. Twist the knife so only the sharp edge, not the flat of the blade, is in contact with the dough. Jiggle the knife gently. If you’ve centered the blade correctly, the coils of all the cut pieces will begin to unroll, on either side of the knife blade, and soon you’ll be holding a score of <em class="calibre4">strangozzi</em> strands. If the dough is sticky in spots, unroll reluctant coils with your fingers. Finally, lower the strands to the work surface, slide them off the knife, gather all into a loose nest, and set it on a floured towel or tray. (If you have problems with this procedure, or don’t have a suitable long implement, unfurl the <em class="calibre4">strangozzi</em> by separating the cut pieces by hand and shaking the coils loose one at a time.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Make <em class="calibre4">strangozzi</em> from the rest of the long dough rectangles. Leave the nests of pasta uncovered, to air-dry at room temperature, until you’re ready to cook them (or freeze the nests on a tray until solid, and pack in airtight ziplock bags).</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour the olive oil into the big skillet, and set it over medium-high heat.

Stir in the marjoram, basil sprigs, and salt, and bring the tomatoes to a boil over high heat; adjust the flame to maintain a steady bubbling simmer. Cook the sauce, uncovered, for about ½ hour, until it has good flavor and is reduced to a consistency you like for dressing pasta.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> For cooking and dressing strangozzi: Bring a large pot of well-salted water (at least 6 quarts water with 1 tablespoon salt) to a rolling boil.

  <p class="extract">This is a fresh and extremely flavorful preparation for <em class="calibre4">strangozzi.</em> The dressing has two components, tender cooked Swiss chard and an uncooked pesto of fresh basil and mint leaves and toasted almonds.

It is best to prepare the greens and pesto shortly before you cook and serve the pasta, but if you follow the recipe steps, the dish is actually quite quick-cooking and simple.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> For the chard and pesto: Bring a large pot of well-salted water (at least 6 quarts with 1 tablespoon salt) to the boil. As it heats, rinse and drain the chard leaves, and cut off the stems; if the central rib of the leaf is thick and tough, cut it out. (Save the trimmings for stock.)

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Bring the sauce to a boil, adjust the heat to keep it bubbling steadily, and let it cook, uncovered, for 20 minutes or so. Lower the heat to maintain a gentle simmer, and cook the sauce for another hour, or until it has good flavor and is reduced to a consistency you like for dressing pasta. You can use some of the sauce right away—you’ll need half of it to dress <em class="calibre4">strangozzi</em>—or let it cool, then refrigerate or freeze for later use.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> For cooking and dressing the <em class="calibre4">strangozzi:</em> Bring a large pot of well-salted water (at least 6 quarts water with 1 tablespoon salt) to a rolling boil. Heat half the meat sauce, about 3 cups, to a bare simmer in a wide skillet or sauté pan (if you’ve just made the sauce, use the same pan). If the sauce has cooled and thickened, loosen it with some of the pasta water.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Shake any excess flour from the nests of <em class="calibre4">strangozzi</em>, and drop all the pasta into the pot, stirring and separating the strands. Rapidly return the water to a rolling boil, and cook the <em class="calibre4">strangozzi</em> for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until barely <em class="calibre4">al dente.</em></p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Lift out the pasta quickly, let it drain for a moment, and drop it into the simmering sauce. Over low heat, toss <em class="calibre4">strangozzi</em> and sauce together for a minute or two, until all the strands are coated and perfectly <em class="calibre4">al dente.</em> (Thin the sauce, if necessary, with hot pasta water, or thicken it quickly over higher heat.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Turn off the heat, sprinkle a cup or so of grated cheese over the <em class="calibre4">strangozzi</em>, and toss well. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil, toss again, and heap the pasta in warm bowls. Serve immediately, passing more cheese at the table.</p>

  <p class="extract"><em class="calibre4">Giardiniera</em>—mixed pickled vegetables—is a ubiquitous and versatile pantry staple in Umbria, as in other parts of Italy. Originally a means of preserving the summer vegetable bounty for the lean winter months, it is now a popular vegetable preparation all year round. Sometimes homemade but more frequently bought in jars from the grocery, <em class="calibre4">giardiniera</em> usually combines crisp chunks and slices of carrot, cauliflower, celery, and sweet or hot peppers; olives, onion, cucumbers, and turnips are in some brands of <em class="calibre4">giardiniera</em>, too. The pickling medium might be vinegar, brine, oil, and spices in a variety of combinations and proportions.</p>

  <p class="indent"><em class="calibre4">Giardiniera</em> right from the jar can be served as an antipasto, a salad, or a side dish. Embellished with freshly poached chicken, as in this recipe, <em class="calibre4">giardiniera</em> becomes a delicious and colorful dish, suitable as an appetizer at dinner, a main course for lunch, or a practical and appealing picnic or buffet salad.</p>

  <p class="indent">When I have time, I make my own <em class="calibre4">giardiniera</em>, which I shared with you in <em class="calibre4">Lidia’s Italian-American Kitchen</em>. But with many fine imported varieties of <em class="calibre4">giardiniera</em> available in most markets, I almost always have a jar of the store-bought kind in the fridge or cupboard, for immediate enjoyment. And with convenience in mind, you don’t always have to poach a chicken to enjoy <em class="calibre4">giardiniera di pollo.</em> Pick up a roast chicken from the market, or use leftover roast chicken or turkey, to make this terrific dinner salad in no time at all.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Salt the scaloppine lightly on both sides, using about ½ teaspoon salt in all.

When the butter begins to bubble, lay as many scaloppine in the pan as you can in one layer (about half the pieces). Cook the first side for a minute or two, just until the meat becomes opaque but doesn’t darken; flip the scaloppine, and lightly fry the second side the same way.

Scatter in the sage leaves, stir, and heat them until sizzling, then pour in the wine and lemon juice. Bring to a boil, and cook to reduce the wine by half. Pour in the stock, heat to a bubbling simmer, and return the scaloppine to the pan, sliding them into the liquid so they’re moistened.

  <p class="extract">Here is another gem from the treasure of pork dishes I found in Umbria, especially around Norcia. Like the preceding recipe for sausages and grapes, this calls for a leisurely approach to cooking, slowly caramelizing the pork and building a fantastic glaze for the chops, with the mingled flavors of lemon, peperoncini, capers, and wine. I always prefer chops on the bone, but you can make this recipe with boneless pork-loin cutlets as well. Since they are usually thinner, they’ll need less cooking time, though gentle and slow browning is still called for.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Trim the fat from the pork chops, if necessary, leaving only a thin layer, and salt them lightly on both sides, using ½ teaspoon salt in all.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Put the butter and olive oil in the skillet, and set it over medium-low heat. When the butter begins to bubble, scatter in the garlic; let it heat and gently sizzle. Meanwhile, spread the flour on a plate or tray, and dredge the chops on all sides. Shake off excess flour, and lay the chops in the skillet in one layer. (It may appear at first that there’s not enough room for all, but as the meat shrinks you will be able to nestle the chops in.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Strew the lemon slices on top of the chops, and drop the peperoncini in between them. Cook the chops slowly, keeping them at a gentle sizzle, turning and moving them in the pan about every 5 minutes, as they take on color gradually and evenly.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> After 20 minutes or so, when the pork is lightly browned and caramelized on both sides, scatter in the capers, shake the pan to drop them onto the bottom, and turn up the heat to medium-high. When the capers are sizzling, push the chops aside, and pour the wine and lemon juice into the clear hot spot. Bring to a boil, and shake the pan so the wine flows around all the chops. Sprinkle over pan the remaining <a class="calibre8" id="page213"></a>salt, and adjust the heat to keep the pan juices bubbling, steadily reducing and thickening. Turn the chops occasionally, so both sides are moistened and evenly cooked.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> After about 10 minutes of reducing the liquid, when the juices are syrupy and glaze the chops, remove the pan from the heat. Sprinkle the chopped parsley all over, and give the chops a final turn in the pan. Serve right away, drizzling a bit of the remaining pan sauce over each chop.</p>

Sweet, chewy, orange-infused, and crusted in nuts, they could be mistaken for fancy candy balls, but they are actually a kind of no-bake cookie, fashioned from a simple dough of bread crumbs cooked in honey. A great way to recycle old bread, these are quickly made, fun to roll, and a delicious treat with tea, coffee, or a dessert wine.</p>

  <div class="block1">
    <p class="nonindent"><span class="small">RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT:</span> A heavy-bottomed saucepan, 3-quart capacity; a clean, smooth, hard countertop or other work surface, about 2 feet square, such as a large metal baking sheet; a long metal spatula; parchment-lined tray or baking sheet</p>
  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> With a sharp paring knife or vegetable peeler, shave off the peel of the oranges in long strips. Scrape away the bitter white pith from the inside of the peel, then dice the strips of zest into small pieces, about ¼ inch square. You should have about a cup of diced peel. (Enjoy the rest of the orange as a fruit.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour the honey into the saucepan, set the pan over medium heat, and stir in the cut orange peel. Slowly bring the honey to a simmer, and cook, stirring frequently, until the squares of peel are slightly translucent, about 3 minutes.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Stir the bread crumbs and 1 cup of the chopped walnuts into the honey, and return to a simmer. Stirring frequently, simmer the mixture gently for 6 minutes or so, until the bread crumbs have absorbed most of the honey, forming a dough that pulls away from the sides of the pan. Take the pan off the heat.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> With a brush or your fingers, spread a thin film of vegetable oil on your clean countertop or other hard work surface. Scrape the dough out of the pan onto the oiled surface and, with the lightly oiled blade of the metal spatula, spread it into a rough round or oblong layer, about ½ inch thick.</p>

Rub a bit of vegetable oil on your fingers and hands (so the dough won’t stick), break off a bunch of teaspoon-sized pieces of warm dough—a dozen or so—and rapidly roll them into bite-sized balls, the size of grapes.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> While still warm, roll the balls in the nuts, so the whole surface gets a light nut coating, and place them on the parchment-lined tray. Working quickly, shape another batch of balls, and coat them with nuts.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When cool, store <em class="calibre4">panmelati</em> in a cookie tin or other airtight container, lined with wax paper. They will keep for about a week.</p>

  <p class="nonindent1">Rocciata di Assisi <img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Makes about 2 dozen cookies</p>

  <p class="extract">You roll up this <em class="calibre4">rocciata</em>, a thin pastry with a fruit-and-nut filling, just as you do a strudel—but you don’t bake it like a strudel. Instead, you slice the roll into thin rounds, lay them flat, and bake them into two dozen rich and beautiful spiral cookies. In this version, I macerate dried fruit overnight in <em class="calibre4">vin santo</em>, one of my favorite sweet wines. There’s always a bit of fruity wine left over, and I cook it into a delicious syrup to drizzle over the cookies.</p>

  <p class="indent">Delicious when dunked in a good espresso, and even better when dunked in grappa, these cookies are nice to have around, as well as to give as gifts at the holidays.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> A day before baking the cookies, prepare the fruit: Mix the chopped dried fruit and chopped apple in a bowl, toss with ½ cup of the sugar, pour in the <em class="calibre4">vin santo</em>, and stir. Cover with plastic wrap, and macerate overnight in the refrigerator.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the dough: Stir together the flour, the remaining ¼ cup sugar, and a pinch of salt in a large bowl. Drizzle in the olive oil, tossing the dry mix with a fork to form coarse crumbs. Beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water, and pour over the crumbs, tossing and mixing them into a slightly sticky dough. Wrap the dough in plastic, press it into a small flat block, and let it rest briefly.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Arrange two racks in the oven, and heat it to 375°. Line the baking sheets with parchment paper.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Unwrap the dough, place it between two other pieces of parchment paper, and roll it into a thin rectangular sheet, 12 by 15 inches. Remove the top parchment, and spread the fruit-nut filling on the dough, leaving a 1-inch margin uncovered on all sides. Gently pat the filling so it adheres to the dough.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Roll up the dough like a jelly roll, starting at one of the longer sides, into a cylinder or log about 15 inches long. You can lift the bottom parchment to support the dough sheet as you fold it over into a spiral, enclosing the filling. When the log is finished, wrap it fully in the parchment paper (so it doesn’t stick to the table), and roll it back and forth a few times to make it more compact (and easier to cut).</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Unwrap the log, and trim off the ends with the serrated knife. Next, slice the log crosswise every ½ inch or so, into disk-shaped spiral cookies. (If these begin to crumble as you cut, re-form the log into a compact shape, and start cutting again.) Lay the cookies flat and spaced apart on the lined baking sheets.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Place the sheets on the two oven racks, and bake for about 15 minutes, then rotate the pans—top to bottom rack, and back to front—and bake another 15 minutes or so, until the dough is golden brown and the filling is bubbling.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Meanwhile, heat the reserved fruit juices to the boil in a small saucepan, and cook until syrupy and reduced to about ¼ cup. Remove the baking sheets from the oven onto wire racks, and while the cookies are still hot, drizzle the fruit syrup over them.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Let the cookies cool completely. They will keep for a week or two if well wrapped or in a cookie tin.</p>

  <p class="extract">This recalls for me the chocolate-and-bread sandwiches that sometimes were my lunch, and always a special treat. And it is another inventive way surplus is used in Umbrian cuisine, with leftover country bread serving as the foundation of an elegant layered dessert.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour the warm espresso into a spouted measuring cup, stir in the rum and sugar until sugar dissolves, then stir in half the melted chocolate. Pour the sauce all over the bread slices, then flip them over and turn them on the tray, to make sure all the surfaces are coated. Let the bread absorb the sauce for a few minutes.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Meanwhile, whip the cream until soft peaks form, by hand or with an electric mixer.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To assemble the parfaits: Break the bread into 1-inch pieces. Use half the pieces to make the bottom parfait layer in the six serving glasses, dropping an equal amount of chocolatey bread into each. Scrape up some of the unabsorbed chocolate sauce that remains on the baking sheet, and drizzle a bit over the bread layers. Next, drop a layer of whipped cream in the glasses, using up half the cream. Top the cream layer with toasted almonds, using half the nuts.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Repeat the layering sequence: drop more soaked bread into each glass, drizzle over it the chocolate sauce from the tray and the remaining melted chocolate. Dollop another layer of whipped cream in the glasses, using it all up, and sprinkle the remaining almonds on top of each parfait. This dessert is best when served immediately, while the melted chocolate is still warm and runny.</p>
