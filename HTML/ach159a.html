<h3 class="h3b"><a id="page_315"/>seared tuna with tomato bread salad</h3>
<p class="author1"><span class="txit">tonno alla piastra con insalata di pomodoro e pane</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This is a wonderful dish to make in the summertime when the tomatoes are exceptionally flavorful and juicy. The fish does not need to be marinated for very long—just about the same amount of time as it will take to make the bread salad. This recipe calls for Gaeta or kalamata olives. Brine-cured Gaeta (as opposed to the wrinkly salt-cured ones) are very similar to kalamata, although they are generally smaller in size. You may choose whichever is most readily available at your local gourmet store or supermarket.</p>

<p class="noindentq">Here is an Asian inspired recipe for a marinade that is less traditionally Italian but is also very good with tuna or swordfish:</p>

<p class="recipe1">2 cloves garlic, crushed or sliced</p>

<p class="recipe1">2 tablespoons canola oil</p>
<p class="recipe1">Kosher salt to taste</p>
<p class="noindenta">Whisk all of the ingredients in a shallow dish. Add the tuna to coat with marinade on both sides. Cover and set aside to marinate at room temperature for at least 30 minutes but not more than 2 hours. Cook following the instructions for the basic tuna recipe.</p>
