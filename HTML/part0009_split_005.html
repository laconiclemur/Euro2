			<p class="rec-intro">Brioche dough is enriched with eggs so is richer than croissants. It makes a delicious cake-like bread that is good served at breakfast – or any other time of day. It’s excellent with savoury terrines too. </p>

			<p class="serves">Makes 1 large loaf or 30 small buns</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">15g fresh yeast</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">500g plain flour, sifted, plus extra for dusting</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">7 free-range eggs</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 tsp salt</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">50g sugar</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">300g softened butter</p>

		<div class="basic-text-frame">
			<p class="body">Place the yeast in a food mixer bowl with a few drops of water to soften it. Add the sifted flour, 6 of the eggs, one at a time, and the salt and sugar, then slowly knead with the dough attachment. You can do this by hand but you get a better result with a machine.</p>
			<p class="body">After 5 minutes, the dough should be smooth and elastic. Add the softened butter and continue to knead at a slightly faster speed for 10 minutes. Make sure all the butter has been incorporated. Put the dough in a large, clean container, cover it with cling film and leave it in the fridge for 12 hours. After 4 hours, knock the dough back by punching it firmly to release the fermentation gases.</p>
			<p class="body">Tip the brioche dough out on to a floured surface and roll it into a loaf tin or shape it into 30 balls and place them on a baking tray. Leave in a warm, draught-free place until risen by a third. Preheat the oven to 200°C/Fan 180°C/Gas 6. Beat the remaining egg and use it to brush the surface of the brioche, then cook until golden. A loaf will take about 40 minutes to cook and small brioche rolls about 15 minutes. </p>
