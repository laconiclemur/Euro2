  <em>Appetizers and Light Snacks</em></h1>

  <h1 class="subchapter" id="heading_id_2">(Vorspeisen und Zwischengerichte)</h1>

  <p class="center1"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L06_r1.jpg" /></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Unlike the Mediterraneans and Scandinavians, who like their appetizer courses to consist of little bits of many things (hors d’oeuvre variés, antipasto, the Greek, Turkish and Arabic meze, and smörgåsbord), the Germans prefer to concentrate on one single dish for their Vorspeise—literally, “before food.” Usually, it is a relatively expensive food item, something that will add a luxurious accent to the meal that follows, and it always has a piquant flavor that will whet the appetite. Vorspeise specialties are so delicious and so attractively arranged and garnished, that it is easy to get carried away and eat too much of this first course. Remember that portions should be large enough to take the edge off ravenous appetites, but small enough to leave room for the rest of the meal. Most of the foods served as Vorspeisen double as Zwischengerichte<a id="fn1a"></a><a class="hlink" href="#fn1"><sup class="frac">*</sup></a>—between-meal dishes that are midmorning second breakfasts, afternoon pickups or even late suppers.</p>

  <p class="indent">The list of Vorspeisen and Zwischengerichte is a long one, and includes an enormous variety of smoked, canned and fresh fish and shellfish, meats, sliced or in salads, stuffed eggs and cheese dishes and vegetable salads. Smoked salmon and caviar, snails done in the manner of Burgundy, and Strasbourg goose-liver pate are as popular in Germany as they are in the rest of Europe, and when a German wants to splurge on an elegant all-out dinner, chances are he will begin by ordering Lobster Mayonnaise. In Germany this will be a boiled, chilled, firm and flavourful <a id="page4"></a>lobster from the waters around Helgoland, the island off the coast of Hamburg famous for these crustaceans. The lobster will be split, its meat loosened, and possibly cut, and replaced in the shell. It will be arranged on a bed of crisp green lettuce and served with a side dish of very rich mayonnaise, bread or toast and butter and a glass of dry white wine. Oysters are another specialty of Hamburg, where they are served, in small restaurants called Austernstuben, along with slices of tangy yellow Cheshire cheese and a glass of dry red wine—a most unusual and delightful appetizer or between-meal snack.</p>

  <p class="footnote" id="fn1"><sup class="frac">*</sup> Also called <em>kleine Imbisse</em>, small snacks.</p>

  <p class="indent">In addition to the Vorspeisen that are popular all over Germany, there are a number of regional favorites based on local specialties. Most Germans like herring, but what is a mild preference in Bavaria becomes a full-scale passion in Schleswig-Holstein, where the North Sea and the Baltic provide a superb variety of fresh herring close at hand. Cured raw hams and bacon, such as those of Westphalia and the Black Forest, are favored on their home grounds. In Bavaria, dozens of types of wursts are sliced up as appetizers, and the people of Pomerania favor a first course of their greatest local delicacy, smoked breast of goose.</p>

  <p class="indent">Since only a small amount of food is needed for Vorspeisen, and because most of them take a great deal of time to prepare, the busy Hausfrau relies on her delicatessen for this course for ordinary family dinners. But you can be sure she has her own set of recipes for all of the popular appetizers and prefers that they be <em>zu Hause gemacht</em> (homemade) for special occasions. Although there are few delicatessens in this country that can compare with the fantastic originals existing in Germany, you should be able to find a fairly good one in any German neighborhood, or in an eastern European or Jewish section, where similar shops are known as “appetizer stores.” These offer the full range of Vorspeise items, except for fresh fish and shellfish and some of the more unusual wursts that are carried only by specialty butchers.</p>

  <p class="indent">Beautiful garnishes are important to Vorspeise platters. Slices of tomatoes, olives, capers, chopped onion or thin onion rings, chives, lettuce, sprigs of parsley and dill, radish roses, carrot curls, strips of green pepper and pimento, sections of mandarin oranges, bits of apple or pear, currant jam or Preiselbeeren, and lemon slices scored around the edges or cut in half and then twisted into butterfly shapes—these are some of the standard frills.</p>

  <p class="indent">Many German appetizers are traditionally served with some special condiment, a particular bread, or a specific drink, and I have indicated the authentic accompaniments when appropriate.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">In addition to the many prepared herrings and herring salads available in delicatessens and appetizer stores, you can find dozens of versions in jars and cans, imported and domestic, in almost all grocery stores, gourmet food departments and supermarkets. None of these is, in my opinion, perfect as is, and many will remain hopeless no matter what you do to them, but if you shop around you should find a few brands that will respond to some doctoring. Depending on the type of herring, its sauce and its flavor, you can do a lot to these preparations by adding, as needed, sour cream, vinegar or sugar if the herring is too sweet or too sour, fresh minced dill or slivers of onions, a pinch of curry powder or a dab of prepared mustard, a slice of lemon or a few spoonfuls of white wine.</p>

  <p class="indent">All of the herring sold in barrels for preparation at home is cured in brine and must be kept soaking in the refrigerator in several changes of cold water before you can proceed with a recipe. Salt herring is a firm fish which, as you might expect from its name, is extremely salty. It can be used interchangeably with the more expensive schmaltz herring, a softer, whiter, fatter, milder and, to my mind, far superior fish. Matjes is a name used to denote a reddish salt-cured herring that has not yet spawned. It is quite salty and richly flavored, very tender and delicate of texture. It is almost always sold in filets and is at its best chilled on ice and served with sprays of dill and hot boiled new potatoes. Bismarck is a sharply flavored herring, pickled whole in a spicy mixture of vinegar, onions, spices and lots of dried red chili peppers.</p>

  <p class="indent">Some type of Schnaps is always served, ice-cold, with a herring course, usually a mild-flavored, potent drink similar to the Scandinavian aquavit or the Russian vodka.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">10 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 salt herring</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 cup boiled, peeled and diced potatoes</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 cup diced cooked beets (canned or fresh)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 large sour apple, peeled, cored and diced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 small onion, minced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 small dill pickle, minced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon sugar, or to taste</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 teaspoon vinegar, or to taste</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 cup sour cream salt as needed</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Clean herring and remove head. Soak 48 hours in 2 quarts cold water, changing water 5 or 6 times. Herring must be kept in refrigerator while soaking. With a sharp pointed knife, slit herring along the backbone. Remove backbone and as many small bones as possible. Pull off blue skin carefully, without tearing flesh of fish. Dice filets. Toss herring, potatoes, beets, apple, onion and pickle together in bowl. Sprinkle sugar and vinegar over top, add sour cream and toss lightly with fork until thoroughly mixed. Taste for seasoning and add salt, sugar, vinegar or sour cream as needed. Turn into serving bowl and chill in refrigerator about 6 hours. Before serving, garnish with chopped hard-cooked eggs.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. This is often varied by adding ½ cup diced veal or beef and ¼ cup diced cervelat to mixture, and add a minced hard-cooked egg as well.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. When meat is used, beets and potatoes may be left out and ½ to ¾ cup of mayonnaise substituted for sour cream. This version is called Feiner Heringssalat—Fine Herring Salad.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_6"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>PICKLED HERRING (Marinierter Hering)</em></h3>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">10 TO 12 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 schmaltz or salt herrings</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 large Spanish onions, peeled, sliced and separated into rings</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1¼ cups white vinegar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¾ cup-water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 teaspoon sugar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon pickling spices</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 bay leaves</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Clean herrings, remove heads and soak as described in above recipe. If you use schmaltz herring, soak 12 hours; salt herring should soak 48 hours before being pickled. Then remove and drain. It may be boned, <a id="page7"></a>skinned and cut in filets, as in Herring Salad, or cut it across in 1½″ slices, leaving bones in and skin on. Using a 2-quart crock, place in it alternate layers of herring and onion rings. Combine vinegar and water with sugar, pickling spices, bay leaves. (Add a pinch of salt to this only if you use schmaltz herrings.) Bring to a boil and simmer 5 minutes. Cool marinade to room temperature, and pour over herrings and onions. Cover crock and place in refrigerator for at least three days.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. A very rich and flavorful sauce results if you use the milt (the soft, milky roe of male herrings) when making it. Sometimes the herrings you buy have milt in them, and if not, the dealer will sell them to you separately. For this recipe, get 4 milts and reduce to a pureé, either by rubbing through a strainer or by whirling in a blender. Add this to cooled marinade and pour over herring.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. For Herring in Sour Cream, remove pickled herring from jar, drain slightly and toss with sour cream into which is mixed a little grated onion and a dash of lemon juice. Season to taste with salt and white pepper and chill a few hours before serving. Finely minced dill can also be added to the cream dressing.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">8 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 salt or schmaltz herrings</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 tablespoons prepared mustard</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>8 slivers of dill pickle</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>8 slices of Spanish onion</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon capers</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1¼ cups white vinegar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¾ cup water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon pickling spice</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 bay leaves</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 large Spanish onions, peeled, sliced and separated into rings</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Clean and soak herrings as described in above recipe; bone and filet as described in Herring Salad. Each herring will yield 2 filets. Pat dry and lay them skin side down. Spread tops with mustard and place crosswise on each filet one sliver of pickle, a slice of onion and sprinkle with a few capers. Roll tightly and tie with string or fasten with two toothpicks. Pack alternate layers of rollmops and remaining onions into 2-quart crock. Prepare marinade as in above recipe and pour over rollmops. Cover and refrigerate 6 to 7 days before serving.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>6 matjes filets</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 cup milk or buttermilk</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>6 thick round slices of apple, peeled</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup white wine</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>6 tablespoons Horseradish</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>Whipped Cream</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 tablespoons minced chives</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Soak matjes filets in milk or buttermilk (I prefer the latter) 2 hours. Let apple slices marinate in white wine 30 minutes to 1 hour. Remove herring filets from milk and drain on paper towel. Put 1 tablespoon Horseradish Cream into center of each filet, roll and fasten with toothpick. Sprinkle top with minced chives. Set each roll on an apple slice that has been drained on paper towel and serve on individual plates garnished with a few slices of pickled beets and several gherkins.</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_9"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>CANNED FISH</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">Tuna fish or sardines in olive oil, anchovy filets, flat or rolled around capers, and the various herrings packed in tomato, mustard, dill, curry or wine sauces, are all popular Vorspeisen. They are usually served with wedges of lemons, chopped onions, or minced hard-cooked eggs, or possibly gherkins. Anchovy filets which are used as garnishes on hard-cooked egg dishes are also served separately as appetizers on buttered toast.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_10"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>SMOKED FISH (Geräucherter Fisch)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">Delicately flavored, golden smoked fish are favorites both as Vorspeisen and Zwischengerichte and they can be had in an enormous variety throughout Germany. Fish market and delicatessen windows are laden with open crates of smoked eel, whitefish, chunks of halibut and haddock, flounder filets, the herrings that are called Buckling, mackerel, butterfish, sturgeon and carp—all looking as though they were covered with sheets of gold leafing. One of the best smoked fish specialties in Germany is called Schillerlocken, long curled strips of shark or dogfish meat. These resemble the corkscrew curls worn by the poet Schiller, <a id="page9"></a>hence the name, which is, incidentally, applied for much the same reason to a cream-filled pastry horn. The fish are now available, packed in oil and canned, in many large cities of the U.S.</p>

  <p class="indent">Smoked trout and whitings are also excellent appetizers. If you cannot get good smoked fish conveniently in your city, or if you would like to serve freshly smoked fish, you can now buy a pan made just for this purpose. Called the Swedish Smoker and available at most large department stores in major cities, this enameled steel pan is about the size of a shoebox, comes with powdered hardwood, and will smoke-cook up to 2 pounds of fish on your kitchen range within 10 minutes. You can prepare the fish early in the day and serve it cold, or smoke it after the guests arrive and serve it warm with melted butter and lemon, a most delectable appetizer perfectly suited to German menus.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Like most north Europeans, the Germans like their shellfish best well-chilled and au naturel. Oysters on the half-shell with lemon, the tiny North Sea shrimp no bigger than a baby’s little finger, Lobster Mayonnaise as described earlier, cold crab and crayfish tails flavored with dill, lemon and possibly mayonnaise, are far and away the most popular versions of seafood. There are also, however, several shellfish salads and variations in the German cuisine as well as a few hot appetizers made from them.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 pound medium-sized shrimp, cooked, shelled and de-veined</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon minced onion</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon minced parsley</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and pepper to taste</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon lemon juice</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup mayonnaise</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1½ tablespoons salad oil</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Toss shrimp with onion and parsley, sprinkle lightly with salt, pepper and lemon juice and refrigerate for about ½ hour, or until just before serving time. Add mayonnaise and trickle oil in slowly until salad has the right creamy consistency and is neither too thin nor too thick. Adjust seasoning and serve on chilled, crisp lettuce leaf.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¼ cup ketchup</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 cup whipped cream</em></p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_14"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>STUFFED EGGS (Gefüllte Eier)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">Stuffed hard-cooked eggs are among the favorite Vorspeisen in Germany, always made with a great deal of mayonnaise and a variety of fillings. Unless they are to be served on a tray along with other cocktail hors d’oeuvre, they are arranged on individual salad plates, garnished with lettuce leaves, tomatoes cut in eighths, thin slices of cervelat and some additional salad or mayonnaise heaped in center of plate. When used as appetizers before a meal, one egg (two halves) is a correct portion. When served as an afternoon snack, as they are in German Konditoreien, two eggs (four halves) make up the standard portion. Although a few specific recipes for stuffed eggs follow, you can obviously take off on your own and make them out of all sorts of leftover meat, fish and salads, or cream the yolks with any one of a number of finely minced herbs or seasonings.</p>

  <p class="indent">To have the most attractive-looking hard-cooked eggs for stuffing, take very fresh eggs out of the refrigerator 15 or 20 minutes before cooking so they will not be too cold. Lower them gently into boiling water, let water come back to boiling point, then lower the flame so they will simmer. After 20 minutes pour off water and place pot under running cold water until eggs are cool. Tap egg gently to crack shell, then roll between your hands to loosen it. Peel under running cold water. To make eggs stand on the plate without rolling around, cut in half lengthwise and cut a small slice off bottom of each half to level it. <a id="page11"></a>Pile filling high in egg white. For a really fancy touch, force yolk filling through a pastry bag, using a star-shaped tube.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_15"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>RUSSIAN EGGS (Russische Eier)</em></h3>

  <p class="hanging"><em>6 hard-cooked eggs</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 tablespoons mayonnaise</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 teaspoon prepared mustard, or to taste</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and white pepper to taste</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>optional garnishes: capers, smoked salmon or black caviar</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Peel eggs and cut in half lengthwise. Remove yolks and mash thoroughly. Add other ingredients and blend well. Refill egg white with yolk mixture, and top with one or two of suggested garnishes. Arrange on individual plates as described under Stuffed Eggs, above. Standard accompaniments to Russian Eggs are salads such as crabmeat, chicken, or tongue and mixed vegetables, or any of the salads described elsewhere in this chapter.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. For 6 eggs stuffed with smoked salmon and caviar, mash yolks with 2 slices of salmon, 2 tablespoons sour cream, I teaspoon grated onion, salt and pepper to taste. Fill egg whites and top with a little dab of caviar. Freshly grated horseradish can also be added to mixture.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. For 6 eggs stuffed with goose-liver pate, mash yolks, pate and 2 tablespoons mayonnaise, salt and pepper to taste. Fill egg whites and top each with a sprinkling of finely diced truffles.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. Other German favorites to be mixed with egg-yolk stuffing include anchovies (3 filets for 6 eggs); crabmeat salad (2 tablespoons for 6 eggs); finely minced cooked ham (2 tablespoons for 6 eggs); Roquefort cheese (about ½ tablespoon for 6 eggs and 2 tablespoons sour cream instead of mayonnaise); and black caviar (1 tablespoon for 6 eggs), 2 tablespoons sour cream instead of mayonnaise, a dash of lemon juice. You can also add a bit of grated onion. This is an excellent way to use the relatively inexpensive pressed caviar.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">For a description of some of the most popular kinds of wursts. It is customary throughout Germany to have an appetizer or in-between meal composed of a platter of several wursts. Four or five varieties are generally included, with 2 slices of each per portion. Gherkins, tomato wedges, radishes, a small amount of potato, beet or cucumber salad, mustard, bread and butter are usually served along with the wursts, and if it is to be a between-meal snack, some sliced cheese may be on the platter also.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">With all of the wonderful cured raw hams available in Germany, it is no surprise to find them as favored appetizers on menus. Similiar to the Italian prosciutto in color and texture, these hams have a mild nutty flavor and are generally served witth a special bread, curls of sweet butter, gherkins and a few radishes. Westphalian ham, which you can easily find at gourmet food shops and German butchers, is usually served sliced paper-thin on little blond wood cutting boards or paddles, about 8” long by 5” wide. Dark Westphalian rye bread or pumpernickel always come with it, as well as a clear fruit brandy.</p>

  <p class="indent">In the Black Forest, a similar ham called Bauernschinken—farmers’ ham—is the local specialty, along with a special smoked bacon that is eaten raw. The latter is especially popular for the midmorning Vesper, the ceremonious snack that takes place throughout Swabia between 10 and 11 <span class="small">A.M</span>. With the raw bacon one eats Bauernbrot, the farmers’ bread that is also served with the cured ham here, and a glass of chilled Kirschwasser, or the plum brandy, Zwetschgenwasser, or a mellow, aged raspberry brandy, Himbeergeist.</p>

  <p class="indent">Italian prosciutto or Prague ham can be substituted. In summer they are served with fresh melons or figs, as in Italy, and are also often accompanied by buttered toast and half a stuffed egg.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>12 asparagus, cooked but firm</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 thin slices boiled or baked ham</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 to 3 tablespoons mayonnaise</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 cups water in which asparagus were cooked</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 envelopes unflavored gelatin</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 teaspoon lemon juice</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Asparagus should be well drained on paper toweling and thoroughly chilled. (Retain water in which it is cooked.) Spread one side of each ham slice with mayonnaise. Lay three asparagus crosswise at one end of each ham slice. Roll ham. Each roll must then be coated with following aspic. Dissolve gelatin in ½ cup cold asparagus water. Flavor remaining water with lemon juice. Heat, remove from stove and add softened gelatin. Stir until it has completely dissolved. When mixture begins to thicken slightly, and before it sets, spoon over ham and asparagus rolls which have been arranged on a large flat dish so they do not touch each other. Place in refrigerator 1 hour or until thoroughly set. Serve on individual salad plates, on lettuce leaves. Decorate tops of ham rolls with pimento strips or chopped hard-cooked eggs. Serve extra mayonnaise on the side.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Literally, Ochsenmaulsalat means ox-mouth salad. To be authentic it should be made with the meat picked from the cheeks and mouth of a cooked corned beef head. Since acquiring a corned beef head and then having it boned so it will fit into a pot is a relatively complicated procedure, I suggest you make this very popular Vorspeise with pickled beef tongue instead. The authentic version is sold at most German delicatessens and sausage butchers and is always on the menu of German and Austrian restaurants.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">4 TO 6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 pickled beef tongue water to cover</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup white vinegar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 onion, minced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and black pepper to taste</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons white vinegar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 to 4 tablespoons olive oil</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page16"></a>Place tongue in pot and cover with cold water. Add ½cup vinegar, bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer gently but steadily about 3 hours. Tongue is done when bones slip out easily and when tip feels tender as you press it between thumb and forefinger. Cool tongue, peel it, slice it thinly and then cut slices into slivers. Mix minced onion, salt, pepper, vinegar and oil together and pour over tongue slivers. Adjust seasoning and add more or less oil and vinegar, according to your taste. Chill until ready to serve. Pour off excess marinade before bringing salad to the table.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Jellied meats or fish are often served as appetizers in Germany. The jelly used in molding these dishes is either of two types: aspic (Aspik), made with unflavored gelatin, and Sülze, a jelly that forms naturally from the bones cooked in the stock. The piquant “sour” Sülze below is the simplest and most commonly served version of that Vorspeise. The jellied meat sausage we know as headcheese is another version of the same thing and can be purchased in many varieties at delicatessens and German butchers.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">APPROXIMATELY 4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 calves’ feet</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 pigs’ feet</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>water to cover</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 cup white vinegar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 large onion</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 bay leaves</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>10 peppercorns</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Wash calves’ and pigs’ feet well in several changes of water. Place in pot with water to cover, vinegar, salt, onion, bay leaves and peppercorns. Bring to a boil and cook briskly 4 or 5 minutes, skimming surface as foam rises. Reduce heat and simmer slowly but steadily for 1½ hours. Remove feet and simmer broth for another ½ hour, or until it is reduced by ⅓ to ½ its original volume. When feet are cool enough to handle, pick meat from bones and place in mold or baking dish. Strain stock through a very fine sieve or cloth, cool and skim fat from surface. Taste for seasoning and add more vinegar if needed. Pour over meat and chill until set. To serve, unmold onto a cold platter, or simply cut portions from mold and place on individual salad plates. Garnish with pickled beets, gherkins, hard-cooked egg slices and freshly grated horseradish.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. To make Wine Sülze, use ¼ cup white wine and ½ cup white vinegar, instead of 1 cup vinegar. When you taste stock after skimming it, flavor it with additional wine.</p>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page17"></a>2. A sliced carrot, a stalk of celery and a leek can be cooked along with other ingredients in the stock. The vegetables can be discarded, or sliced and molded along with meat.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. Gherkins, pickled beets and/or hard-cooked egg slices can be molded into the Sülze, instead of being served on the side.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">4. For an even meatier Sülze, cook 1 pound lean pork along with the feet. When done, slice in thin flat slabs and place smaller bits of meat from feet on top of pork slices before pouring stock. Because the bottom slice of meat forms a small “plate,” this version is known as Tellersülze; it can be molded in individual portions in any small, flat but rimmed, oval, square or round dish. A shirred-egg dish would be perfect.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">This is a featured item in all the apple-wine taverns in the Sachsenhausen section of Frankfurt. It is usually served as a light entree but makes a very piquant appetizer, especially with cocktails. It is also an excellent midnight snack, good with beer, but best of all with apple wine or hard cider, served in blue and gray stoneware pitchers as in Frankfurt. It should be made with Handkäse, the German hand cheese, strong-smelling but delicious. If you cannot get that, use a Liederkranz that is not too runny, or a slice of Tilsit.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Now that the cocktail party is an international institution, so are canapés, and in Germany you’ll find them made mainly of the dishes used in larger portions as appetizers. One of the most popular is Beef Tartar, Schlemmerschnitte, served on small rounds of rye bread. Chopped Westphalian-type ham with minced onion (on white bread as well) is popular too, and the Germans love all sorts of little cornucopias filled with various things and held together with toothpicks. Smoked salmon stuffed with a dab of Horseradish Cream; salami or tongue filled with Remoulade Dressing or Italian Salad; chicken, lobster or crab salad on white bread or pumpernickel—all are popular. Caviar on buttered toast rounds, garnished with chopped hard-cooked egg; Strasbourg goose-liver paté; smoked salmon mashed and blended with cream cheese and grated horseradish on thin pumpernickel are a few other favorite cocktail items. In addition, the Germans prepare little bits of meats and cheese stuck on toothpicks, generally without any bread. A cube of Swiss cheese topped with a stuffed olive, a chunk of ham and a gherkin … all sorts of such tidbits are run up on a little toothpick skewer. Tiny cherry tomatoes or mushroom caps are filled with salads or pates, and the platters are beautifully ornamented with fancy cut radishes, lemon slices, gherkins, etc.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">When the Germans want an assorted appetizer, they produce this platter with a nod toward Sweden and its smörgåsbord. It includes a number of the salads described in this chapter, cold sliced meat, cheese, wursts, tuna fish and sardines, a couple of kinds of herring, some pickled beets, a cucumber salad and the like.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Most German restaurants and all cafés feature a group of dishes for appetizers or light meals, known as Toast and Belegtes Butterbrot. These are really open sandwiches, usually hot when they are on toast, cold when on bread slices. When you order one of these open sandwiches, you generally get two pieces of bread, each with a different, complementary topping. If you order an open sandwich of ham or smoked salmon, the other piece of bread may be topped with sliced hard-cooked egg; and if you order chicken salad, asparagus tips with mayonnaise will probably top the accompanying bread slice. Other Belegtes Butterbrot toppings include Beef Tartar, sliced hard-cooked eggs and anchovies, wursts, cheeses, sardines with paper-thin lemon slices, sliced tongue with vegetable salad, rare roast beef with freshly grated horseradish, and many of the meat and fish salads described in this chapter.</p>

  <p class="indent">The breads used vary with the toppings. French-style white bread and all of the German rye and pumpernickel breads are used, as are the various crisp breads, most especially for cheese. Flavored butter is often used on these open sandwiches. Let the butter soften at room temperature, then mash it with whichever flavorings you want to add: minced dill, parsley or other green herbs, caraway seeds, hot or sweet mustard, anchovy paste, pounded cooked crabmeat, shrimp or lobster, sautéed and minced mushrooms, mashed sardines, grated horseradish, grated cheese, mashed hard-cooked egg yolk, curry powder, lemon juice with a little grated rind; even finely pounded nut meats such as walnuts or toasted almonds, or powdered ginger, rum or brandy, garlic, chives or onions.</p>

  <p class="indent">Bread Sandwiches are, as far as I know, completely German, and a favorite in rural areas. They are made of 1 slice of pumpernickel, buttered or spread with fresh lard or bacon dripping and salt on both sides, then sandwiched between 2 slices of sour rye bread. Crusts may be trimmed off or left on.</p>

  <p class="indent">The toast that is the base for the hot sandwiches is sautéed to a crisp golden brown on both sides, then drained quickly on paper toweling. Though caviar, goose-liver paté and sardines are often served on toast, the usual toppings are more complicated. Creamed Mushrooms with or without a slice of ham or tongue, Roquefort Cheese and Apples, Ham and Asparagus au Gratin, and scrambled eggs with minced ham and chives are typical. Oriental Toast is topped with cubes of canned pineapple, a slice of mustard fruit, cooked ham and Swiss cheese, all grilled for a few minutes under the broiler. Smoked oysters or mussels with Lemon-Horseradish are elegant and unusual Toaste, and to show you how complicated things can get, the wonderful Café König in Baden-Baden even offers something called Toast Miami, topped with a pan-broiled slice of beef filet, pineapple chunks, apple slices, <a id="page22"></a>a few sections of mandarins or tangerines, cream sauce and the cranberry-like Preiselbeeren.</p>

  <p class="indent">These toasts and open sandwiches are interesting and appetizing whether they begin a meal or comprise the light lunch or between-meal pickup. Leftovers are perfect for toppings, and remember that these sandwiches are always eaten with a fork and knife. Garnishes around the sandwiches include such things as gherkins, pickled beets, raw vegetables and salads, lemon slices, etc. Lettuce may be on the side, but it is never, never on the sandwich itself.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>12 anchovy filets, lightly rinsed in water and drained on paper towelling</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>minced parsley</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>lemon juice</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>butter, slightly softened</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Heat oven to 425°. Cut crusts off toasted bread slices. Arrange in a shallow buttered baking dish. Sprinkle a layer of cheese on each slice of toast. Place three anchovy filets on each slice and sprinkle with a few capers, a little minced parsley and a few drops of lemon juice. Dot with butter. Sprinkle with a top layer of Parmesan cheese. Bake in upper third of oven 10 to 15 minutes, or until cheese is bubbly and light golden brown on top.

To serve this as canapés with cocktails, cut each slice of toast in quarters after it has baked.</p>
