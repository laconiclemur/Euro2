<p class="noindenti"><span class="stickup">T</span>hey say “man cannot live on bread alone.” I wonder if this is true, because sometimes I think I might be able to pull it off, I love it so much. Its pure simplicity is its attraction. Bread is a before, an in-between, and an after. It is the first food that most of us turn to when hunger begins to gnaw. The baguettes of France, the flatbreads of the Middle East, the soda breads of Ireland, and the countless Italian breads: focaccia, schiacciata, pizza, the bland saltless bread of Florence (made this way so as not to interfere with the flavor of the sauce when used for dipping)—the varieties are endless. But what is constant is that we all find comfort in this most basic and spiritual of foods.</p>
<p class="indenti">Homemade bread and pizza were staples in my mother’s home when she was growing up. My grandmother worked during the week, so on the weekends she would bake several loaves at once to be eaten throughout the week, topped with jellies made from fruit my grandfather grew or generously spread with homemade ricotta made from fresh goat’s milk.</p>
<p class="indenti">As Joan recalls: “When she was done baking, my mother would put aside one or two loaves of bread for slicing. She would return these slices to the oven to be baked a second time. We called this bread <span class="txit">biscotto</span>. It was excellent eaten like a cracker with soup or topped with chopped fresh tomatoes and olive oil. To me it tasted better than a cookie.”</p>
