<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">Cervantes’s seventeenth-century romantic “hero,” Don Quixote, kept telling his manservant Sancho Panza not to eat garlic, as it would betray the vileness of his character. And the strong smell of garlic that assailed the knight the first time he saw his beloved Dulcinea del Toboso made him think that an evil magician had disguised her as a coarse peasant woman. Scholars of the period have a possible interpretation—that the smell of garlic was a coded message that she was a Conversa (Christian convert from Judaism), because at the time converted Jews were derided as eaters of excessive amounts of garlic. The Catalan food writer and critic Xavier Domingo, who wrote</span> El Sabor de España <span class="italic">(</span>The Taste of Spain<span class="italic">), once commented, “There are many cuisines in Spain, but they all have one thing in common—garlic.” However, its lavish use is a particular characteristic of Castilian cooking. If you are fond of garlic, add the peeled cloves of two whole heads—they will become soft, sweet, and mellow. That is how I like it, but I have to say that it is more common to cook the cloves in their skins and to remove them before serving. Serve this with potatoes or with bread to soak up the sauce. Rabbit is also great cooked in this way.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4 TO 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">1 chicken (about 3½ pounds), cut into 6 pieces</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">1 to 2 heads of garlic, cloves separated and peeled</p>
<p class="qun">3 bay leaves, preferably fresh</p>
<p class="qun">1 cup dry white wine or dry sherry</p>
<p class="qun1">1 cup chicken stock (or 1 cup water plus ½ bouillon cube)</p>
<p class="recsum">Heat the oil in a wide heavy-bottomed casserole or pan. Put in the chicken pieces and brown them all over, turning occasionally and seasoning with salt and pepper. Do them in batches if your pan is not wide enough to hold them in one layer. Remove them and fry the garlic cloves in the same oil over low heat until just lightly golden.</p>
<p class="summary">Return the chicken to the pot, add the bay leaves, and pour in the wine or sherry and chicken stock. Simmer, covered, for about 10 minutes, turning the chicken pieces occasionally. When the breasts are done, take them out and continue to cook the thighs and legs, uncovered, for another 10 to 15 minutes, until cooked through and no longer pink when you cut into them with a knife. Return the breasts and heat through.</p>
