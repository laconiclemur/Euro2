<p class="yield">MAKES ABOUT 1 QUART/1 L; SERVES 2 TO 4</p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">The classic Spanish sangría is bold with red wine, fruity, and a touch sweet with sugar. This recipe has two of those three attributes. The sweetness here is natural, coming from the fruits themselves. Cointreau, made from both sweet and bitter orange peels, gives the sangria lovely citrus flavors. Avoid adding fizzy water or wedges of citrus fruit (add anything more than peels and it will need sugar), or chilling too deeply. The flavors and aromas of the wine and fruit should come clearly through. While flavors will be diluted by adding ice, in summer—when the temperature soars—adding a couple of cubes to the glass is a temptation that, like most people, I find impossible to resist.</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">     Serve the sangria among friends for an informal, festive drink. It goes well with most tapas. The best pairing? Perhaps dates wrapped in slices of bacon</span> <a href="53-chapter32.html#page_75"><span class="red">(see page 75)</span></a><span class="red">, whose lovely salty sweetness is nicely complemented by sangria—as is strong chorizo from Navarra and some tinned <em>berberechos</em> (cockles) given a dash of sherry vinegar.</span></strong></p>
