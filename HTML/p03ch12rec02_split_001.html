<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">We ate</span> fabada <span class="italic">at Casa Fermín in Oviedo, Asturias. Luis Alberto Martínez Abascal and María Jesús Gil García served us a stupendous avant-garde Asturian tasting menu. At the end, when we thought we could not eat any more, we asked for a taste of a traditional</span> fabada <span class="italic">and out it came.</span> Fabada <span class="italic">is the iconic festive dish of Asturias that has become popular all over Spain. The special Asturian large white beans called</span> fabes <span class="italic">(</span>faba <span class="italic">in the singular) that are used to make it have a delicious nutty flavor, a buttery texture, and a thin skin that melts in your mouth. Those of the best qualities from special farms are referred to as</span> del cura <span class="italic">(of the priest),</span> del peón <span class="italic">(of the farm laborer), or</span> del colmillo <span class="italic">(of the sharp tooth). They are expensive and hard to find outside Spain, but you can use other large white beans. We heard more about</span> fabada <span class="italic">from Jaime Rodriguez, our host at the guesthouse where I stayed in the mountains with the journalist Jane Kramer (see page 554). The family had kept cows, and the rooms where we stayed had been where the cows slept. They used to make</span> fabada <span class="italic">with smaller white beans that are easier to grow and cheaper than</span> fabes<span class="italic">, which grow entwined around cornstalks and need careful nurturing. They ate</span> fabada<span class="italic">, with tiny pieces of home-cured bacon, chorizo, and blood sausage, three or four times a week. The grand version, made years ago for weddings, has plenty of cured pork meats and sausages, blood sausage, pig’s feet and ears, and sometimes spareribs or</span> cecina <span class="italic">(cured beef). The following recipe has the most common combination of ingredients. In Asturias, pork products are always smoked because families cured them in their smoky fireplaces, since it was typically wet outside and damp in their lofts. I prefer them unsmoked. By tradition, all the ingredients are cooked together, but many now prefer to cook the meats separately, as I do, to eliminate some of the fat. Some people also like to present the beans and meats separately.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 pound <span class="italic">fabes</span> or other large white beans, such as butter or lima, soaked (see Soaking Beans, page 487)</p>
<p class="qun">1 small onion</p>
<p class="qun">A head of garlic, unpeeled</p>
<p class="qun">2 bay leaves</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">A pinch of saffron threads (optional)</p>
<p class="qun">½ pound <span class="italic">lacón</span> (fatty dry-cured ham from the shoulder) or an additional ½ pound pancetta, salt pork, or bacon</p>
<p class="qun">¼ pound pancetta or slab bacon, in one piece</p>
<p class="qun">2 semi-cured chorizos</p>
<p class="qun1">2 <span class="italic">morcillas</span> (Spanish blood sausages), about 8 ounces</p>
<p class="recsum">Drain the beans and put them in a large pan with enough fresh cold water to cover them by about one fat finger. Bring to a boil, skimming the foam that floats to the top, then add the onion, garlic, and bay leaves. Simmer gently over very low heat, partially covered, shaking the pan occasionally so that the beans do not stick to the bottom, until they are tender. The time depends on the type and age of the beans. It can take from 1 to 2 hours, so start trying them as you near 1 hour to see if they are soft, and watch if they begin to break. Add cold water as necessary to keep the beans covered all the time. You should end up with a soupy stew. When the beans have begun to soften, add salt to taste. Add the saffron, if you like, at this stage.</p>
<p class="summary">Meanwhile, as soon as you start cooking the beans, put the cured ham and pancetta or bacon in a large saucepan in plenty of water and bring to a boil, then simmer over low heat for 1 hour. Add the chorizos and simmer for 15 minutes. Add the blood sausages and cook for 10 minutes more. Drain, and cut the sausages into thick slices. When the beans are tender, return the meats and heat through.</p>
