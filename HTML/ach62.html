<p class="author1"><span class="txit">salsa alla maria rosa</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">The year my family was living in Florence my sister Gina became friends with a young girl named Mirca. My parents in turn became friends with Mirca’s parents—Vittorio, who was a policeman, and his wife, Maria Rosa. To this day they remain friends, phoning throughout the year and visiting whenever they have the opportunity. Maria Rosa taught my mother how to make this sauce. We serve <span class="txit">Salsa alla Maria Rosa</span> with penne, farfalle, ziti, or any other long tubular pasta such as rotini or fusilli. It can also be used to prepare <a class="nounder" href="ach85.html#page_164">Green Lasagna</a>. This sauce freezes very well.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons butter</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup diced carrots (about 2 medium-size carrots)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup diced celery (about 2 small tender stalks)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup diced onions (about <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> large onion)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cloves garlic, chopped</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 cups canned whole plum tomatoes (about one 35-ounce can)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">In a large saucepan set over a medium heat, melt the butter in the olive oil. When the butter is foaming, add the carrots, celery, onions, and garlic and cook, stirring often, until they have softened, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the parsley. Stir in the tomatoes, crushing them with your hands or with the back of a slotted spoon as you add them to the pan. Bring the sauce to a boil. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, partially covered, until the tomatoes are sweetened and cooked, about 45 minutes.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATIONS</span>:</span> To create a less coarse version of this sauce, puree the tomatoes in a food mill or food processor before proceeding with the recipe. Also, 1 pound ground beef may be added to the sauce before the tomatoes. Cook until the beef is lightly browned and then proceed with the recipe.</p>
