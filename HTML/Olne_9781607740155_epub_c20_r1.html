  </div>

  <p class="nonindent sgc-1"><a id="page304"></a>Practically speaking, the presentation of this menu is extremely simple, for nearly everything may be prepared in advance: the <em>coq au vin</em> must be put to warm, eggs and cream beaten and the quiche put to bake one hour before going to table, and the potatoes put to steam just before the guests are seated—nothing more.</p>

  <p class="indent">The visual succession is exciting, as it progresses from the tender, natural garden colors of the <em>crudités</em> through the delicate pinks and creams of the quiche, masked by a golden gratin, and the rich, bitter-chocolate-colored velvet of the <em>coq au vin</em> sauce, thrown into relief by the green of the parsley and the white potatoes, the deep greens of the salad—which, in season, may be enhanced, both in appearance and taste, by the addition of a handful of brilliantly colored nasturtium flowers—and the pale yellow and cool, transparent red of the <em>flamri</em>, recalling, to some extent, the quiche, but with more fantasy and sharper relief. The pale green, ruby, and deep gold of the wines enrich the effect.</p>

  <p class="indent">The <em>crudités</em>, fresh and clean, sharpen the appetite. They do nothing for a wine, but as one’s guests’ glasses should never be empty, the simplest solution is to serve the same wine that will accompany the quiche. The quiche is delicate in flavor and light in effect. If it were not followed by a rich sauce, it might be accompanied by one, but it stands well without and marries beautifully with a young, fruity white wine.</p>

  <p class="indent">The high point, culinarily speaking, is the rich and robust main dish, the quality of whose sauce holds the key to the essential success of the meal. It would kill a wine that is elaborate with the nuances of age—therefore, the wine climax follows with the cheeses.</p>

  <p class="indent">The <em>flamri</em> is light. It is refined without being sophisticated, and above all, it is not rich. The Sauternes, though rich, is so totally different in character from the entire gamut of preceding wines that it, too, refreshes, cleanses and relaxes a jaded palate.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="c20-s77"><a id="page305"></a>THE CRUDITES</h2>

  <p class="nonindent"><em>Crudités</em> can be any combination of fresh, tender, young raw vegetables: tiny, white heads of cauliflower, little radishes, the small, elongated, light green, sweet Italian peppers, peeled and grated (or better, passed through the medium blade of a <em>mouli-julienne</em>), hearts of celery, cherry tomatoes, scallions (if they are not too strong), bulb fennel, Belgian endives, avocados (the tiny, seedless variety, recently developed, provides a very pretty element in a <em>crudités</em> still-life presentation). Among the most delicate of <em>crudités</em> are very young broad beans (<em>fèves</em>, often known in America by their Italian name, <em>fave</em>), and violet artichokes, picked before the choke is developed. The former are eaten simply with coarse salt, and the latter with vinaigrette or simply with salt, pepper and olive oil. Both are greatly appreciated in the south of France, where every morning in the beautiful outdoor markets, lines of rough and picturesque ladies try to outbellow each other to sell their freshly picked vegetables <em>du pays</em>. The first native <em>fèves</em> each year, toward the end of January, bring astounding prices, and it is considered a sacrilege to cook them. In Italy both <em>fave</em> and tiny artichokes are often eaten after the main course as a salad replacement, the broad beans sometimes in conjunction with cheese. Both are difficult to find in American markets, but could easily be grown in our more temperate climates.</p>

  <p class="indent"><em>Crudités</em> should be accompanied by slices of rough peasant bread (in America, where such bread is not easily come by, Jewish sourdough rye bread, although too pronounced in flavor for many dishes, accompanies this kind of thing well), fresh unsalted butter, coarse salt (sea salt, if available), fruity olive oil and wine vinegar.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="c20.5">THE SHRIMP QUICHE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">The shrimp and the pastry may be prepared and the pastry shell partly baked several hours in advance, which leaves nothing to be done at <a id="page306"></a>Spring Menus the last minute except to beat together the eggs and cream and put the quiche to bake.</p>

  <p class="indent">The preliminary shrimp preparation is identical to that of crayfish (<em>écrevisses</em>) <em>à la bordelaise</em>, which in itself is a fine dish. It is a great pity that in the United States the heads of the shrimp are discarded before they appear on the market, for they contain flavor and material enough to produce a splendid sauce.</p>

  <p class="indent">Where no fresh seafood is available, frozen shrimp, although never as succulent as the fresh, may serve as a replacement. Do not boil them as recommended on the package, but simply plunge them into cold water to defrost them, sponge them dry in a towel, and proceed as for the others.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c20-s78"><em><span class="color">Shrimp Quiche</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Quiche aux Crevettes</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="extract"><em>The pastry:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>⅔ cup all-purpose flour</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>pinch of salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>6 tablespoons (3 ounces) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2½–3 tablespoons cold water</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">After sifting the flour and salt into a bowl, you may mix in the butter with your fingers, as do the French, or cut it with knives in the American manner. The essential things to remember are:</p>

  <p class="indent">1. The butter should be cold and firm so that it does not mash into a purée in the flour. Cut it into pieces before adding it.</p>

  <p class="indent">2. The dough should be worked as rapidly and as little as possible. Stop the moment you have a pebbled mixture in which the largest pebbles are the size of small peas.</p>

  <p class="indent">3. The more butter that can be incorporated into the flour, the finer the pastry—flours differ.</p>

  <p class="indent">4. Add only enough cold water to transform it into an adherent mass, working it deftly and no more than necessary with a fork.</p>

  <p class="indent">5. Wrap it in wax paper or a plastic bag and leave it for a couple of hours in the refrigerator, so that it may relax and lose its elasticity.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page307"></a>The pastry takes 2 or 3 minutes to prepare and somewhat less time to roll out.</p>

  <p class="indent">Flour the ball of dough on a floured board and form it into a patty. Roll it out rapidly. Be certain that the board and the upper surface of the paste remain well floured, turning it over on the board 3 or 4 times during the process to ensure this. Fold the sheet of pastry in two, pick it up gently at the folded edge, drop it gently, once, on the board to rid it of excess flour and slip it into pie dish or tart mold. If you have only American pie tins, it couldn’t make less difference—the presentation is not less attractive. Press the dough to the form of the mold and trim the pastry all around the edge, leaving an excess of about ½ inch. If, through inexperience, your pastry sheet was not altogether circular, there may be a skimpy point or two at the edge—it is very simple to moisten the edge of a piece of trimming and attach it to the short edge of the pastry. Roll the outer edge under, press it to the border all the way around, and “scallop” it with the side of your thumb, dipped repeatedly in flour. Prick the inside in several places with a fork, line the pastry with a round of kitchen paper or light aluminum foil, pour in enough dried beans, lentils or raw rice to provide sufficient weight to prevent the crust from buckling, and partly bake it for 15 minutes in a medium oven—350°–375° F. Remove the weighted paper and return the shell to the oven for 3 or 4 minutes to dry it out. Put it aside.</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="extract"><em>The shrimp:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 tablespoons <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#prf5.19">Mirepoix</a>, or 1 medium carrot, 1 medium onion, thyme, bay leaf, salt, pepper, 2 tablespoons butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¾ pound fresh small shrimp</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon olive oil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pinch Cayenne pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon cognac</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup dry white wine</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup heavy cream</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">If you have no <em>mirepoix</em> on hand, it should be prepared in advance as described on <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#page75">this page</a>.</p>

  <p class="indent">Rinse the shrimp and sponge them dry in a towel. Do not shell them.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page308"></a>Heat the oil in a <em>sauteuse</em> or frying pan, add the shrimp and the <em>mirepoix</em>, salt, pepper and Cayenne, tossing and stirring with a wooden spoon over a high flame until the shrimp has turned pink on all sides. Add the cognac, light it and continue stirring until the flames are extinguished, add the white wine and reduce until the liquid has nearly disappeared. Put aside to cool.</p>

  <p class="indent">Shell the shrimp, leaving the tail segment of the shell attached to 10 or 12 of them (depending on their size) and pound the shells in a mortar. Stir into the pounded shells ½ cup of cream, transfer to a small saucepan, bring to a boil, then pass the mixture through a fine sieve, working the residue well with a wooden pestle in order to extract all the flavorful—and colorful—juices. Reserve.</p>

  <p class="indent">Arrange the shrimp with the tail segments around the edge of the pastry shell so that they lean against the side with the tail tips protruding above the border of the shell. Cut the rest of the shrimp into pieces and distribute them in an even layer on the bottom of the shell.</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="extract"><em>The quiche batter:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 eggs</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, freshly ground pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup heavy cream</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 small handful freshly grated Swiss Gruyère</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Combine in a bowl the eggs, salt, freshly ground pepper, the reserved shrimp-flavored cream and the additional cup of cream, beat together with a rotary beater, pour the mixture into the pastry shell, sprinkle the surface with cheese and bake in a moderate oven (350°–375° F.) for approximately ½ hour. The quiche is done when the center of the custard is firm. It may be left in the oven with the door ajar for ½ hour or so before serving—and it is better warm than hot.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="c20.1">THE COQ AU VIN</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">The <em>coq au vin</em> usually found, whether in cookbooks, in restaurants, or in the home, is a red-wine stew made from young fryer-type chickens. It is not a bad dish when properly done; but it is only logical that a bird no more than 2 months old, though perfect for a sauté (in <a id="page309"></a>which flavor, through a fairly rapid cooking process, is concentrated in the seared flesh) should be less satisfactory in a dish whose qualities depend on the flavor and gelatinous material which, over an extended cooking period, may be drawn from the meat into a reduced and concentrated sauce. A <em>coq au vin</em> prepared in a Burgundy peasant (which does not mean poor) kitchen is made from a year-old cock, neither too tough nor too tender, that has lived in liberty and been liberally fed on grain. (This beast, incidentally, is no easier to find in a Paris market than in New York.) Its sauce is a concentration of essences that, at the ultimate point of refinement, no more than coats the pieces of chicken, and that depends uniquely on its natural gelatin and the body of the aromatic elements for the thickening—no flour.</p>

  <p class="indent">The recipe that I give you is a compromise. If you are a farmer or have farmer friends, you may have no trouble finding the perfect bird. If you are obliged to use young, commercially raised chickens, there are several points to bear in mind:</p>

  <p class="indent">1. Replace the large bird by 2 smaller ones—or buy parts and use only leg and thigh sections, which lend themselves better to this type of preparation than do breasts.</p>

  <p class="indent">2. Replace half the red wine by a rich gelatinous <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#rh1">Veal Stock</a> or veal-and-chicken stock.</p>

  <p class="indent">3. Do not overcook the chicken—30 or 40 minutes is enough, but reduce the sauce radically after having passed it through a sieve.</p>

  <p class="indent">A <em>coq au vin</em> is at least as good reheated, which is obviously an advantage. You have only to add the garnish, gently reheat it and leave it to barely simmer for 15 or 20 minutes before serving it.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c20-s79"><em><span class="color">Chicken in Red Wine</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Coq au Vin</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 strips lean side pork, salted or smoked, approximately ⅔ inch thick</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 medium-sized carrots</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 medium-sized onions</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 bird, preferably a cock weighing around 6 pounds, 10–12 months old, cut into serving pieces</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><a id="page310"></a><em>2 tablespoons flour</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 bouquet garni (thyme, bay leaf, parsley)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ cup cognac</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 bottle good red wine (the same as served as accompaniment, for instance)</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Garnish:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ pound mushrooms</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>butter</em> (<em>5 or 6 ounces in all</em>)</p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>25–30 small white onions</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>6 slices firm-textured white bread for croutons</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 clove garlic</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>chopped parsley</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Cut off the rind from the side pork and cut each strip in ⅔-inch sections. Parboil them for 2 minutes, drain, and sponge them dry in a towel. Put them to fry, over a low flame, in a large <em>sauteuse</em> or skillet with a bit of oil (butter is nearly always called for, but it makes absolutely no difference—none of its flavor remains, and it is actually skimmed off and discarded at a later stage). When the strips are golden brown on all sides, remove them and put them aside. In the same cooking fat place the carrots, peeled and cut into 1- or 2-inch sections, and the onions, peeled and cut into pieces or coarsely chopped. Keep the flame medium to low and allow them to cook, stirring regularly to avoid overbrowning, for 20–30 minutes. Remove the vegetables, put them aside and replace them by the chicken pieces, previously salted and peppered. Cook them over a somewhat higher flame until gently browned on all sides, sprinkle with flour and continue to cook, turning the pieces as necessary. Return the sautéed onions and carrots to the pan. When the flour has cooked for a few minutes, pour in the cognac, then the wine and raise the heat. Stir <a id="page311"></a>the chicken pieces and move them around until the liquid comes to a boil. At this point, unless you are working with a very large, heavy pan, in which all the chicken may remain and continue cooking over a tiny flame, everything may suddenly seem complicated and messy. Don’t worry about it. If the skillet is already overfull of the chicken, or if perhaps you have had to use 2 skillets that both seem too full to permit adding the vegetables, keep the carrots and onions aside and add them later when the chicken goes into the oven dish. Transfer the chicken pieces and vegetables to an oven dish of some sort (earthenware, copper, enameled cast-iron casserole, etc.) with a lid, add the <em>bouquet garni</em> (or simply sprinkle with thyme leaves and add the bay leaf and parsley branches untied). Stir and scrape the pan with a wooden spoon to loosen and dissolve the frying adherents. Pour the liquid over the chicken pieces. If they are not entirely covered, add enough wine, water or good stock (water is better than indifferent stock) to barely, but completely, cover them. Put to cook, covered, in the oven, regulating the heat so that the sauce hardly simmers. The length of cooking time depends altogether on the bird’s age and “past”—from 30 minutes for a fryer that has never exercised to 1½ hours for a 10-month-old rooster, and still an hour longer for one that may be too old to have a fine flesh but will produce a marvelous sauce.</p>

  <p class="indent">Meanwhile, wash the mushrooms rapidly and sponge them dry. If they are small, leave them whole, otherwise cut each in 2 or 4 pieces. Toss them in butter over a high flame, seasoned with salt and freshly ground pepper, for 2 or 3 minutes. Peel the little onions, leaving them whole, and cook them, seasoned, in butter over a very low flame, shaking the pan from time to time, for 20–30 minutes. Keep them covered and avoid browning them—if the saucepan is not heavy enough, you may have to use an asbestos pad over the flame.</p>

  <p class="indent">Transfer the chicken pieces and the carrots to a platter, discard the discernible remains of the <em>bouquet garni</em> and skim as much fat from the surface as possible. Pass the cooking liquid through a very fine sieve, using a wooden pestle to work it, pour it into a saucepan, bring it to a boil, then place the saucepan over the flame so as to permit its contents to simmer only on one side. A skin will begin to appear on the surface containing fat plus other impurities. Carefully pull it to one side with a spoon, remove it and discard it. Repeat this process regularly for approximately ½ hour. This skimming process, in French called <em>dépouillement</em>, is too often avoided because it is time-consuming and boring. It is, however, essential to the purity and digestibility of the sauce. If, at this point, the sauce is still not consistent enough, turn the fire up to create a rapid boil and reduce it rapidly to the right consistency, stirring constantly.</p>

  <p class="indent">Replace the chicken pieces in the oven dish, distribute the garnish (sautéed mushrooms, glazed little onions, and fried side pork sections) <a id="page312"></a>on top and pour the sauce over. Cover and return to the oven to simmer gently for 15–30 minutes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Trim the crusts from the bread slices, cut slices in half diagonally and brown them in butter over a low flame until golden and crisp. They will absorb an astonishing quantity of butter. They may be prepared ahead of time and rewarmed in the oven.</p>

  <p class="indent">To serve, dispose the chicken pieces more or less symmetrically on a large, heated platter. Rub the crouton triangles with the clove of garlic, dip one corner of each in the sauce, then in chopped parsley, and arrange them around the edge of the platter, parslied tips pointing out, pour sauce and garnish over the chicken and sprinkle with a bit of chopped parsley. Serve the steamed potatoes separately.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_2">THE FLAMRI WITH RASPBERRY SAUCE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">A <em>flamri</em>, to my way of thinking, is a perfect type of dessert. It is light, simple, full of nuances, and not rich. The quality and personality of the wine used in its preparation remains to an amazing degree in the final product. Its presentation is attractive and admits endless fantasies. I usually prefer to prepare it in the simplest type of mold (charlotte), but sometimes I do it in a series of decorative molds of different sizes, unmold one on top of the other in a tiered fashion, and decorate with—in addition to the raspberry purée—whipped cream into which a certain amount of raspberry purée has been incorporated, and a few whole raspberries. An apricot sauce accompanies it equally well.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c20-s80"><em><span class="color">Flamri with Raspberry Sauce</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Flamri à la Purée de Framboises</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup good dry white wine</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup (4 ounces) fine semolina</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¾ cup sugar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><a id="page313"></a><em>small pinch of salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 egg</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 egg whites</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pint fresh raspberries (or 1 package frozen)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>sugar to taste</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Combine the water and the wine in a saucepan and bring them to a boil. Sprinkle in the semolina in a slow stream and from well above the saucepan, stirring all the time with a wooden spoon. Leave, covered, to cook gently for 25 minutes. (I have never tried the quick-cooking or “minute” products—they are probably satisfactory if you cannot find the other.) Remove from the fire and mix in immediately (if you leave it to stand, a skin forms rapidly on the surface) the sugar, the salt and the whole egg. Beat the egg whites until stiff and fold them delicately into the mixture. Pour it into a buttered mold, cover with a round of buttered kitchen paper, and poach in a <em>bain-marie</em> for 40 minutes (a <em>bain-marie</em> in this instance may be either a large saucepan with a tight-fitting lid containing enough hot water to reach the ⅔ mark on the mold, kept over a low flame on top of the stove, or an open receptacle containing an equivalent amount of hot water and placed in a medium oven). The water should be close to the boiling point but not allowed to boil during the poaching process.</p>

  <p class="indent">Allow the pudding to cool until lukewarm, then unmold it onto the serving dish (if it is allowed to chill completely before unmolding, it will stick to the mold), but leave the mold over the pudding to protect it from the air until just before serving, chilled and coated with raspberry sauce. Serve a sauceboat of raspberry purée separately.</p>

  <p class="indent">For the raspberry purée, pass the raspberries through a fine sieve, preferably nonmetallic (nylon), and add sugar to taste. When fresh raspberries are in season, they should, of course, be used, but, in fact, frozen raspberries are one of the few frozen products that I have found to be altogether satisfactory.</p>
