<p class="noindent"><span class="stickup">T</span>hroughout my childhood, almost every night in the middle of dinner, my father would shake his head and ask, “What does the rest of the world eat?” That’s how good my mother’s cooking has always been—to my dad, it was inconceivable that anyone could possibly eat as well as we did. And I agreed with him every time.</p>
<p class="indent">Today, as an adult who has traveled enough to have experienced a number of cultures and cuisines, I still agree with my father. Not that I haven’t discovered incredibly delicious dishes outside the old homestead, but for consistent ingenuity and excellence, my mother’s cooking is hard to beat. I am all too aware of the cliché at work here: the eldest son of an Italian American family saying, in essence, that no one cooks as well as his mother. But in this case it is not mere sentiment that leads me to this conclusion, but a sensitive and discerning palate.</p>
<p class="indent">Whether this palate is a God-given gift or something that has been honed over the years, I cannot say. I would think it is a little bit of both. Having grown up in a household that was “food obsessed,” I cannot help but put a more-than-ordinary emphasis on what goes into my mouth and how it tastes. My family spends hours deciding what to make for a certain meal and days preparing it, and while the food is being eaten, discusses not only its merits and its faults, but what it tasted like when prepared at such and such a restaurant, or by this and that family member or friend, and what it really should be served with, which inevitably leads to a discussion of where it was first eaten and with what, and how <span class="txit">that</span> dish was prepared and how one day wouldn’t it really be nice to make that dish, which really is one of the best dishes ever eaten, though it could never compare to a dish once eaten in . . . and so on and so on.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_xii"/>Food, above politics, art, or personal matters, is the subject to which we return over and over again. Possibly because we derive nourishment from it not only physically but spiritually, and to us, the creation of a great meal is perhaps the ultimate artistic endeavor. Edible art.</p>
<p class="indent">There is some truth to the old adage “Most of the world eats to live, but Italians live to eat.” My parents instilled in my sisters and me a great respect for our heritage and its traditions. Consequently, in my work I feel it is necessary to explore and celebrate from whom and where I come. The film <span class="txit">Big Night</span> was born partly from this need. In writing it with my cousin Joseph Tropiano, I hoped to offer not only a positive view of Italians (i.e., no gangsters) but a more humanistic view, one that would show the complexity of this extraordinary people.</p>
<p class="indent">During the final stages of writing the script, Isabella Rossellini was kind enough to enable me to visit any of her friend Pino Luongo’s six restaurants so I might continue my research. I chose Le Madri, where I was introduced to the head chef, Gianni Scappin. For the next year and a half I would visit him and he would teach me whatever I asked to be taught. We would also spend hours just talking about food, restaurants, Italy versus America, my hopes for the film, and his hopes for his own restaurant.</p>
<p class="indent">Little did Gianni know that in so many ways he influenced my creation of the character that I played in the film. I ended up using many of his inflections, intonations, and gestures as Secondo. This, coupled with his knowledge of Italian cuisine and the machinations of running a restaurant, was invaluable.</p>
<p class="indent">The fact that Gianni is from northern Italy was also of great value to me. I learned a great deal about the similarities and vast differences between northern and southern Italian cuisine from him, which is fascinating to me and a big part of the inspiration for this book. I am the grandson of Calabrian immigrants, and most of the food both sides of my family cooked was primarily from that region. After I had introduced Gianni to my parents and saw that they were fast becoming friends, it occurred to me that a cookbook combining the recipes of two northern and southern Italian families would be a wonderful opportunity for them to share their personal and culinary histories with anyone who loves a good story and good food.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_xiii"/>Also, for selfish reasons, I did not want the recipes that I had grown up with to disappear with the passing of my parents in years to come. The influence of these dishes has been so significant in shaping who I am that I felt it would be foolish if they were not documented for me, my children, and future generations. I knew Gianni felt the same way about his family’s recipes as well.</p>
<p class="indent">As I got to know Gianni better, I realized that not only was he an intelligent, witty, and generous person, but he was also an artist. To watch him create a meal is fascinating. He is a whirlwind of passion and professionalism, and if you are ever fortunate enough to taste the results of his culinary expertise, you will understand what I mean when I use the word “artist.”</p>
<p class="indent">While working side by side with Gianni in the ensuing years, I have learned quite a bit about him, his family, and the history that inspired him to become a chef. He was raised in the tiny village of Mason Vicentino, which is located halfway between Venice and Verona in the area of Italy known as the Veneto. This region is very close to the Austrian border, and over the centuries, due to war and politics, the Veneto has alternated between Austrian and Italian rule. This has greatly influenced the local culture and cuisine—which I think is evident in some of Gianni’s recipes.</p>
<p class="indent">Gianni grew up in a modest, frugal home with a brother and three sisters. His parents worked hard running the family restaurant, Trattoria alla Pesa, and at age fourteen, Gianni began his own pursuit of a culinary career. He attended Recoaro Terme Culinary Institute, which offers an extensive externship program, and as a result, he worked in the kitchens of luxury hotels all over Italy—in Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Liguria, Lombardy, Trentino Alto Adige, and Sardinia. With each assignment he became familiar with the variety of ingredients and methods of preparation for which these different regions of Italy are known.</p>
<p class="indent">Gianni arrived in New York in 1983, after having worked in England, where he learned English, and at the Excelsior Hotel on the Lido in Venice, where he learned to work with large teams of other cooks. When he became the executive chef of Castellano, a highly successful restaurant in New York, Gianni began adding home-style dishes to the menu—focaccia, tiramisu, and risotto, all of which were practically unknown in the United States at the time—and the popularity of Castellano skyrocketed, suddenly drawing celebrities such as Mick Jagger and Clint Eastwood.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_xiv"/>Nine years later, after a stint in Washington, D.C., where his restaurant Bice was awarded three and a half stars by the <span class="txit">Washington Post,</span> Gianni became the head chef at Pino Luongo’s Le Madri, where we met. It was during his years at Le Madri that Gianni developed the balance between sophistication and simplicity that you will find in his recipes.</p>
<p class="indent">It was a real treat to bring together my parents and Gianni to create this book, to listen to them talk about the preparation of food in great detail, comparing and contrasting their methods and watching them learn from each other. Since Gianni is a classically French-trained professional chef, and my mother is a self-taught, just plain great cook, one might assume their working methods and approaches would be very different. But as it turns out, this was not necessarily true. Just like anyone who is very good at what he or she does, both Joan and Gianni are very specific about certain aspects of preparing a dish, such as dough-kneading techniques, the exact size to dice a carrot, what type of frying pan to use. But when it came to measurements during the testing process, the answer from both of them was often, “it depends.” Needless to say, this drove our collaborator Mimi a bit mad, as she was the one who had to document with as much exactitude as possible the proper measurements for each recipe. However, as you will see, it all worked out in the end.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a strong connection between <span class="txit">Big Night</span> and this book. I’ve always felt that film was partly about respect for one’s heritage and the pursuit of truth in one’s art. To me this cookbook embodies those themes. It is a collection of recipes by people I love, who love to cook because they love their past and want to pass its truths on to the next generation.</p>
<p class="indent">In each recipe, we have worked hard to document those often elusive touches and techniques that result in a great meal as opposed to an ordinary one. By worrying over each detail—for the first time in either the Tucci or the Scappin family history—we have committed to paper the ingredients needed to create a collection of extraordinary meals that reflect the land and the people we came from and that give us so much joy day after day. We hope this cookbook becomes a source for as many of your own unforgettable meals as its recipes have for ours.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="txit">Buon appetito!</span></p>
