<span class="big">T</span>
he balmy perfume of ripe peaches on a hot summer’s day is hard to beat, although the citrus scent of Christmas must come a very close second. Seasonal ripe fruit, picked in its prime and brought straight to market creates a feast of smells, colours, textures and taste. It is small wonder that Spanish home cooks are not generally known for their desserts. Who would bother when the year is punctuated by the arrival of so many different varieties of fruit? The flavour of a lusciously ripe fig oozing with sticky juices or the exotic sweetness of a tiny Tenerife banana requires no assistance at all.</p>
<p class="indent">A January market stall in Ibiza resembles fruit stands all over Mediterranean and Southern Spain, a citrus sea of oranges, clementines, mandarins and lemons. Strangely the Spanish have not adopted our love of marmalade and many of the bitter Seville oranges are left to rot on the trees. Oranges are sometimes used in savoury dishes with fish, duck or pork or whisked into a fabulous <em>Allioli</em>
 (see page 114), but most are squeezed for juice; a popular dessert in restaurants and the healthy choice if you choose not to stir in the accompanying sachet of sugar.</p>
<p class="indent">Strawberries come with the spring. Huge <em>fresónes</em>
 from Huelva in the Southwest arrive first, but the smaller <em>fresas</em>
 are always worth waiting for. Pricey punnets of the exquisitely perfumed <em>fresas de bosque</em>
, or wild strawberries, are sometimes available too, a truly extravagant treat.</p>
<p class="indent">The first stone fruits of summer are from the East coast. Refreshing, sweet <em>nísperas</em>
, Japanese medlars or loquats, used to be greeted with glee when the local citrus season had come to a close and the apricots, cherries and early figs, <em>brevas</em>
, were yet to arrive. Shopping today, it is more difficult to notice the seasons since much of the fruit is imported or produced in the monstrous greenhouses of Almeria in the South. But, visit the local market and this month’s crop will always be the most economical and delicious.</p>
<p class="indent">Thirst-quenching watermelons make their timely appearance in the full heat of summer. Entire vans are stacked from floor to ceiling making a melon avalanche a dangerous possibility should you select the wrong one. Gluts of June cherries make way for luscious nectarines, peaches and my favourites, the flat <em>paraguayos</em>
, or Saturn peaches, somewhat unglamorously re-christened doughnut peaches by one British retailer! The white-fleshed fruit is consistently sweet and a recipe for a sticky chin, since you just have to try one there and then.</p>
<p class="indent">Plums, apples and pears are most suited to Spain’s cooler Northern half. One bite of a golden greengage in Santiago de Compostela brought back childhood memories of orchard fruit picking. It was heaven, incomparable with the insipid flesh of an imported plum. Meanwhile, pears from Rioja, a very tasty prospect poached in the local wine, and <em>Reineta</em>
, or Russet apples, from León travel well and are celebrated all over the country. Autumnal quinces fill kitchens with steam as laborious housewives busy themselves making the slabs of firm quince paste, <em>Dulce de Membrillo</em>
 (see page 170) that make such a popular accompaniment to cheese. The sloes of the Basque country and Navarre have a more masculine fan base. They are a vital ingredient in Pacharán: a digestif made with <em>anis</em>
, an aniseed liqueur, coffee beans, cinnamon sticks and whatever else the family recipe dictates.</p>
<p class="indent">The subtropical climes of the Canary Islands, and a small corner of southern Andalucia put a few exotic fruits on the menu too. Mangoes, custard apples, the odd pineapple and, of course, the ambrosial dwarf bananas.</p>

naranjas caramelizadas</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_3">caramelized oranges</h1>
<p class="nonindent">I was after half a dozen oranges at the market in Órgiva and was glad to find an old chap with a wheelbarrow load for sale. Unfortunately he was so intent on selling the lot that you could only buy them by the bucketful. The fruit was such a bargain that I even offered the same price for half the quantity but he was having none of it. So eventually, laden like a packhorse, I got home to make this timeless dessert, thankful for his resolve.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 unwaxed oranges</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 tbsp Grand Marnier or sweet Pedro Jimenez sherry</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 tbsp white granulated sugar</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 tbsp water</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Remove the zest from the oranges and set aside.</p>
<p class="extract">Peel the oranges, removing all the bitter white pith, then cut the oranges into slices and remove any seeds. Put the oranges into a serving dish and pour over the alcohol.</p>
<p class="extract">Now you can make the caramel. Place the sugar and water in a small saucepan and cook gently over a low heat until the sugar has dissolved. Increase the heat and allow the sugar to begin to caramelize, turning light golden brown, but do not stir. Remove the pan from the heat; the caramel will carry on cooking. You are aiming for a light brick brown colour. Add the orange zest and pour over the oranges.</p>
<p class="extract">Leave the oranges to macerate at room temperature for a few hours before serving.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Citrus zest</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">It is unlikely that oranges or lemons will be waxed if you purchase them directly from a small producer at the local market. However, most commercial producers do wax their fruit to extend its shelf life Those same producers are extremely likely to have used a myriad of pesticides both before and after picking the fruit. So, when using the zest, which is packed with richly flavoured essential oils, be sure to buy fruit that is produced organically or labelled unwaxed. Otherwise, pour boiling water over the fruit and give it a light scrub before using.</p>
<p class="indent2">Only use the outer skin of the fruit as the white pith is extremely bitter.</p>

granizado de limón</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_5">lemon ice</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Decades ago <em>Granizado de Limón</em>
 used to be sold from small carts on the streets of Valencia. The refreshing half-drink/half-sorbet was a wonderful antidote to the stifling summer heat before the days of air conditioning. Nowadays you can buy <em>Granizado</em>
 from bars the length of the Mediterranean coast, but sadly much of it is made from sickly commercial syrup. Once you taste the real thing you will know. This makes a refreshing afternoon drink or light dessert.</p>
<p class="aserves">makes just over 600 ml/1 pint</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 lemons</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>6 tbsp caster sugar</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 litre/2 pints water</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Using a potato peeler, pare the lemons. You just want the outer skin and none of the bitter pith.</p>
<p class="extract">Place the lemon peel, sugar and 150 ml/5 fl oz water in a pan and simmer for 5 minutes. Strain the lemon syrup and add the remaining water and the juice of the lemons. Pour the mixture into a shallow container and freeze.</p>
<p class="extract">As the <em>granizado</em>
 begins to harden, remove from the freezer and stir with a fork. Repeat this process 3 times. Serve while still slushy or you can leave it to defrost slightly before serving.</p>
<p class="extract">Alternatively, if you have a sturdy blender, freeze the <em>granizado</em>
 in ice-cube trays – you can always store the cubes in a bag once frozen – then whiz the cubes to a slush before serving in tall glasses.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Tip</strong>
 You could leave the freezing out altogether and serve this as refreshing lemonade with a few fresh mint leaves and an ice cube.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>The indispensable fruit</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Lemons are vital in the Spanish kitchen. The zest flavours countless desserts but more importantly the juice is used as a last minute seasoning for many a savoury dish, adding a zippy, fresh touch. So, when you season your food don’t just consider that familiar duo of salt and pepper but lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil too.</p>
<p class="indent2">A whole lemon studded with cloves makes an excellent fridge freshener and is also reputed to keep away flies, should you be cooking or eating out of doors.</p>

tarta de manzana</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_7">apple cake</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Apple orchards clothe many of the lush hillsides of the North, from Asturias to the Basque country. Admittedly much of the crop is destined for cider: a local passion. From January to April the Basques flock to the <em>Sagardotegiak</em>
, cider houses, to down the new season brew, fresh from the barrel. Meanwhile, Asturian barmen pour their cider from an arm’s length above the head into a glass clasped at the thigh – a deft feat of showmanship that aerates the otherwise flat cider. Thankfully some apples do escape the press; table varieties such as the <em>Reineta</em>
, or Russet, make delicious eating.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 8–10</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>170 g/6 oz butter, softened, plus extra for greasing</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 eating apples, peeled and sliced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>½ tsp ground cinnamon</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tsp vanilla extract</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>juice of ½ lemon</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 tbsp cider</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>170 g/6 oz soft brown sugar, or a mixture of dark brown sugar and caster sugar</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 eggs, beaten</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>170 g/6 oz flour</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tsp baking powder</strong>
</p>
<p class="aserves0">
<span class="gray"><br/>

</p>
<p class="aserves0">
<span class="gray">for the glaze</span>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp lemon juice</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 tbsp icing sugar</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/Gas Mark 5.</p>
<p class="extract">Grease a 23 cm/9 inch springform cake tin with butter and line the base with baking paper.</p>
<p class="extract">Toss the apples with the cinnamon, vanilla extract, lemon juice and cider. In another bowl, beat the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Gradually add the egg to the butter and sugar a little at a time. Take care to beat thoroughly between additions, throwing in a tablespoon of flour if the mixture begins to curdle.</p>
<p class="extract">Strain off the liquid from the apple slices. Sift the flour and baking powder together and fold into the cake mixture together with the liquid from the apple slices.</p>
<p class="extract">Now spread the mixture over the base of the prepared tin and add the apple slices. You need not be too precious about the arrangement, as the sponge will rise up and cover most of the apple. Place in the middle of the oven and cook for about 50 minutes until a deep, golden brown colour. Spear the centre of the cake with a skewer, it should come out clean, any ‘custardy’ juices mean the cake needs a few more minutes. Leave the cake to cool slightly in the tin.</p>
<p class="extract">Meanwhile, mix together the lemon juice and icing sugar to make a thin glaze. Brush the top of the cake with the glaze and serve warm or at room temperature.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Cooking with apples</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">
<em>Reineta</em>
, or Russet, Golden Delicious and Granny Smith are the ideal apples to cook with as they hold their shape well and also have a good flavour. They are all available in Spain.</p>
<p class="indent2">Peeled apples turn brown in a trice, so always dip in lemon juice or prepare a bowl of water with a little lemon juice to place them in while preparing your dish. Drain and dry off before use.</p>

manzanas al horno</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_9">baked apples</h1>
<p class="nonindent">These apples are an autumnal treat, stuffed with whatever mixture of dried fruit and nuts that comes to hand. It is an ideal opportunity to clear the baking cupboard of all the bags of stray ingredients before they are past their best. Alternatively, you may go to the market and find the <em>puesto de frutos secos</em>
 – an entire stall devoted to dried fruit and nuts, and buy a wonderful selection specifically for the dish.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>30 g/1 oz butter, softened</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>8 dried apricots, dates or figs, or a mixture, roughly chopped</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp raisins or sultanas</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 tbsp dark rum, brandy or sweet sherry</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 <strong>
<em>Reineta</em>
</strong>
, or other firm eating apples</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 tbsp chopped roasted almonds, hazelnuts, pine kernels or walnuts, or a mixture</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>90 g/3¼ oz brown sugar or 3 tbsp honey</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>ice cream, to serve</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/Gas Mark 5.</p>
<p class="extract">Grease a small ovenproof dish with a little of the butter. Place the dried fruit and alcohol in a small pan and heat gently until piping hot. Or you can use the microwave. Leave the mixture to macerate.</p>
<p class="extract">Meanwhile, remove the cores from the apples. You may have a gadget for the job, but a bit of careful excavation with a small kitchen knife will work too. Next, using a sharp knife, cut an equator through the skin around each apple to prevent the apple from splitting during cooking. Place the apples in the prepared dish.</p>
<p class="extract">Mix the remaining butter, nuts, half of the sugar, the dried fruit and alcohol together and stuff the apples with the mixture. Top with the remaining sugar or honey.</p>
<p class="extract">Pour about 1 cm/½ inch of water around the apples and bake for about 45 minutes, or until tender. Serve warm with any escaped juices and a spoonful of ice cream.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Variations</strong>
 For an ambrosial dessert you could bake empty, cored apples until tender then, while still warm, fill with <em>Crema Catalana</em>
 custard (see page 119). Top with plenty of sugar and then place under the grill to brown. Serve right away.</p>
<p class="extract">Incorporate 150 g/5 oz of minced pork together with a pinch of ground cinnamon into the stuffing, substitute the rum with white wine and you have Catalan <em>pomes farcides</em>
, a traditional <em>fiesta</em>
 favourite.</p>

compota de cerezas</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_11">cherry compote</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Extremadura is cherry country, and in June the weekly markets in Cáceres and Plasencia are inundated with the fruit. Entire stalls sell the magenta, heart-shaped <em>picotas</em>
, a highly esteemed local variety. The nearby valley of Jerte is Europe’s largest cherry orchard. Village doorways hang with hand-written signs ‘<em>hay cerezas</em>
’, cherries for sale, and the fruit is distilled to make a potent brandy, <em>aguardiente</em>
.</p>
<p class="indent">Lusciously ripe cherries are a treat just as they come, but this simple recipe makes a fabulous change. Try stirring the compote into yogurt or cream, whiz with ice cream for a few seconds in a food processor for a cheat’s cherry ripple, or serve with almond meringues (see <em>Soplillos</em>
 on page 122).</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 8</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>450 g/1 lb ripe cherries, stoned</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>150 g/5 oz brown sugar</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>100 ml/3½ fl oz water</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>100 ml/3½ fl oz <strong>
<em>aguardiente de cereza</em>
</strong>
, the local cherry ‘firewater’, or Kirsch</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Place the cherries in a non-reactive pan, stainless steel or enamel will do fine, with the sugar, alcohol and water. Simmer gently for 40 minutes, stirring from time to time.</p>
<p class="extract">If the compote seems very runny, then strain the cherries, place the syrup back in the pan and boil until reduced. Leave to cool and serve as required.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Buying and storing cherries</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Select firm and shiny fruit with its green stem still intact.</p>
<p class="indent2">Colour is nothing to go by as fabulously sweet cherries can range from pale peachy shades right through to purple depending on the variety.</p>
<p class="indent2">Do ask for a taste; cherries must be picked when fully ripe since their sugar levels will not increase in the fruit bowl.</p>
<p class="indent2">Keep cherries in the refrigerator in hot weather, but do not wash or remove stalks until the last minute. <em>Guindas</em>
 are very sour cherries, which are ideal for cooking, but inedible raw, while <em>cerezas</em>
 are their sweeter cousins.</p>

gratinado de higo</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_13">fig and sherry gratin</h1>
<p class="nonindent">A lusciously ripe fig needs no accompaniment at all, but if you are lucky, you may just find yourself with a glut of fruit. This dessert is an absolute treat – a <em>zabaglione</em>
 with a Spanish sherry twist. You could add some raspberries or blackberries too.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>8 ripe figs</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>a pinch of ground cinnamon</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 egg yolks</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>100 g/4 oz caster sugar</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>70 ml/2½ fl oz <strong>
<em>Oloroso</em>
</strong>
 sherry</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Slice the figs thinly. There is no need to peel them unless the skin feels particularly tough. Arrange the figs in a heatproof serving dish or 4 individual <em>Crema Catalana</em>
 dishes and sprinkle with cinnamon.</p>
<p class="extract">Next place the egg yolks, sugar and sherry in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of boiling water and whisk together until you have a luxuriously creamy, light foam. Reduce the heat and continue beating until the mixture is thick and pale.</p>
<p class="extract">Pour the mixture over the figs and refrigerate until almost ready to serve or, alternatively, go to the next step straightaway.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat the grill to its highest setting and place the figs under the heat until the egg mixture begins to brown. Serve at once.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Sweet and savoury</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">The natural sweetness of a ripe fig is fabulous paired with <em>jamón, sobrasada</em>
 (see page 49) or salty, blue cheese such as Picos de Europa.</p>
<p class="indent2">Figs also seem to have a natural affinity with duck. Try warming a few in the oven with a dash of brandy and serving alongside a pink duck breast.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Buying and storing figs</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Figs have two seasons in Spain. The first to arrive, in early summer, are the bigger <em>brevas</em>
. Many favour these over the late summer <em>higos</em>
, saying that they are more flavoursome and thinner skinned. I love both.</p>
<p class="indent2">There is no general rule that a green fig should be tastier than a black one, they are purely different varieties, although the most highly prized Spanish fig is the green ‘<em>cuello de dama</em>
’ from Tiétar valley to the west of Madrid.</p>
<p class="indent2">At the market it is advisable to select figs that are still just firm or you will end up with something resembling ‘road kill’ by the time you get home.</p>
<p class="indent2">Leave the figs to ripen on a windowsill or patio and eat while still warm from the sun. Ripe figs will begin to ooze a juicy nectar, the <em>miel de higo</em>
, from their base. A slightly firmer fig will benefit enormously from a few minutes in a medium-hot oven to warm through.</p>

fresas con vinagre</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_15">strawberries with vinegar</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Spanish strawberries can range from rather disappointing, monstrous things the size of an apricot, grown out of season, under acres of polythene in the South, to the petite and delectable Catalan <em>Maduixes del Maresme</em>
. The latter are grown on the slopes of the Mediterranean Maresme coast to the north of Barcelona. In spring the locals are prepared to pay premium prices to enjoy their unbeatable flavour and would possibly consider the vinegar treatment absolute heresy. Thankfully there are abundant supplies of well-priced sun-ripened strawberries all over Spain in spring and early summer, so you may like to give this a try.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>450 g/1 lb strawberries, hulled and halved</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1–2 tbsp caster sugar to taste</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>½–1 tbsp mature sherry vinegar</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">First you will need to gauge the sweetness and acidity of your ingredients – a perfectly good excuse to tuck in to a few strawberries while you are working.</p>
<p class="extract">If the strawberries are beautifully ripe and sweet you may decide to add less sugar. It is worth tasting the vinegar too, some of the more matured varieties are rich and mellow while others are quite acidic; just adjust the quantity according to taste.</p>
<p class="extract">Leave the fruit to macerate for at least 2 hours in the refrigerator. Allow to reach room temperature while you eat the rest of your meal and serve with <em>Nata Montada</em>
, or whipped cream with a pinch of sugar.</p>

And so, after years of knowledgeable tapping and listening for hollow clues, it turns out that it is all just down to potluck.</p>

<p class="ingreds">
<strong>4 large slices of watermelon</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>8 fresh mint leaves, finely chopped</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Cut the fruit into small triangles, or balls if you must, then remove as many seeds as possible and stir up with a touch of mint before serving.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Tips</strong>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;This makes a really refreshing lunchtime dessert, as watermelon is a great natural thirst quencher. Or, for a touch of sophistication you could try serving this as a palate cleanser between courses.</p>
<p class="extract">You can, of course, add a little caster sugar if the watermelon is not quite sweet enough. 150g/5 oz stoned cherries would make a delicious addition too.</p>

<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_19">rosé poached peaches</h1>
<p class="nonindent">The Lérida province of Catalonia is home to vast orchards and olive groves and so every Saturday Balaguer’s arcaded square is transformed into a bustling market of fabulous local produce. The archways afford some shade and protection from the searing sun, but still the perfume of ripe peaches warmed by the all-pervasive heat is unforgettable.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>6 ripe peaches, skinned (see tip)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 bottle rosé wine</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>5 tbsp caster sugar</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 vanilla pod, split in half lengthways</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 large peelings of lemon zest</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Halve the peaches and carefully remove the stones.</p>
<p class="extract">Pour the wine into a large pan that will accommodate all your peaches and add the sugar, vanilla pod and lemon zest. Add the peaches together with just enough water to cover them and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 15 minutes. Remove the peaches from the wine syrup and set aside.</p>
<p class="extract">Now boil the wine syrup until it reduces to a thick, sticky syrup. Remove the vanilla pod and lemon zest. Serve the peaches covered in the fabulously aromatic syrup.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Tip</strong>
 To skin truly ripe peaches, you can cover them with boiling water for about 30 seconds. The skin should slip off easily rather like a tomato skin. Firmer fruit will need to be simmered for 3–4 minutes until the skins slide off.</p>

<p class="nonindent">The length of time that you poach these pears will be down to the ripeness of the fruit. Ideally the flesh should yield a little around the stem when pinched. You may prefer to leave the pears whole, in which case, you should add 10 minutes to the poaching time.</p>

Keen Spanish cooks snap up the fragrant fruit and busy themselves making jelly to last the winter while many of us would not give the quince a second glance.</p>
<p class="indent">It is certainly no conventional beauty, resembling a large ungainly pear with the odd patch of grey down. It hardly screams ‘buy me’. It is not convenience food either since its flesh is virtually inedible raw. Yet, with a little cooking and a spoonful of sugar (or ten!) the fruit is transformed into a rusty red delight, with its own honeyed flavour and deliciously granular texture. <em>Dulce de Membrillo</em>
 makes a wonderful partner for sharp cheeses and keeps for months.</p>
<p class="aserves">makes a large slab</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 kg/2¼ lb quinces, washed but not peeled</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>about 300 ml/10 fl oz water</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>about 750 g/1½ lb caster sugar (see method)</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Wipe away any suede-like down from the quince skin, remove the cores and cut the fruit into chunks. The flesh will discolour as it oxidizes, but it is not a problem as your jelly will be a rich reddish brown by the time you have finished.</p>
<p class="extract">Place the quinces in a large pan with the water, bring to the boil and cook until it softens, about 20–30 minutes, then strain off the water.</p>
<p class="extract">Now you need to purée the fruit. Ideally you would use a <em>pasapurés</em>
 (see page 17), because this will leave the pulp skin-free, but you can whiz in a food processor, then strain the purée through a very fine sieve or muslin.</p>
<p class="extract">Weigh the purée and add an equal weight of sugar. Return to the pan and simmer gently until the sugar has dissolved. Increase the heat and boil until the mixture thickens. This will probably take at least an hour of regular stirring. Beware – the paste will spit like the devil, so use your longest wooden spoon and an oven-glove. Eventually, and patience is required, the paste will turn a deep, brick red colour and the spoon will virtually stand up by itself.</p>
<p class="extract">Line a small tin with greaseproof paper. The shape is up to you, but a loaf tin would do nicely. Fill with the paste and leave to set for a minimum of 12 hours.</p>
<p class="extract">Once the paste has set you can turn it out onto a board. Wrap in clingfilm and store in a cool place.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Variation</strong>
 <em>Dulce de Membrillo</em>
 is fabulous served with lamb, when combined with garlic and extra virgin olive oil in a mortar, or food processor.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Tennis elbow?</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Or just lacking time and inclination for all that stirring:<br/>
The paste can be cooked in the microwave with excellent results.</p>
<p class="indent2">Once you have mixed together the quince purée and sugar place it in a roomy glass bowl; you must leave plenty of space for expansion. Cover with microwave clingfilm and cook on the medium setting for 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="indent2">Remove from the microwave with extreme care – you are dealing with molten lava, and give the paste a stir. Re-cover and repeat the process twice more until the paste is wonderfully thick and turns a deep brick red colour.</p>
<p class="indent2">Microwave settings do vary, so if the jelly seems pale and syrupy you may need to give it one last 10 minute blast.</p>

macedonia de otoño</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_25">autumnal fruit salad</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Sweet potato may seem a bizarre addition to this seasonal fruit salad, but this is not some fanciful experiment, <em>boniato</em>
 is used in many traditional Spanish sweets. Small <em>empanada</em>
 pastries are filled with sweet potato in Valencia, while fried slices are served with honey in Mallorca.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 6–8</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>juice of 1 lemon</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 tbsp honey</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>about 300 ml/10 fl oz hot water</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 stick cinnamon</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>500 g/1 lb 2 oz quinces</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>500 g/1 lb 2 oz sweet potatoes, ideally the orange fleshed variety, washed but not peeled</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>6 oranges, 4 peeled, cut into pith-free slices/segments, and 2 juiced</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 apples, cut into small chunks and dipped in the orange juice</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>juice of ½ lemon (optional)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1–2 tbsp honey (optional)</strong>
</p>
<p class="aserves0"><br/>
</p>
<p class="aserves0">to serve</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp toasted flaked almonds</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>yogurt or cream</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/Gas Mark 4.</p>
<p class="extract">Mix the lemon juice, honey and the hot water together, then pour the liquid into a baking tin or ovenproof dish large enough to fit the quince halves in a single layer.</p>
<p class="extract">Cut the quinces in half and remove the stalks and cores. The fruit will be very hard so a good paring knife will come in handy. A sharp melon-baller is great for removing the core too. Place the quinces, cut-side down, in the tin or dish before they have a chance to brown. Add the cinnamon and bake for until tender, about 30 minutes to 1 hour. Make sure all the liquid does not evaporate and the quinces burn while baking, so top up the liquid, if necessary – this will make a delicious syrup.</p>
<p class="extract">Leave the quinces to cool, then cut into small chunks. You may like to remove the peel, but that is up to you. Reserve the syrup left in the tin, ideally about 150 ml/5 fl oz. If you have a lot more syrup then you could boil it for a moment or two to reduce down.</p>
<p class="extract">Meanwhile, prick the sweet potatoes and bake them for 20–40 minutes, depending on size, until just tender. Leave to cool, then peel off the skin and cut into small chunks.</p>
<p class="extract">Place the quinces, potatoes, oranges and apples in a large serving bowl.</p>
<p class="extract">Mix the orange juice and quince syrup together and pour over the fruit. Taste – too sweet, add the lemon juice, too tart and a little honey will do the trick.</p>
<p class="extract">Serve at room temperature sprinkled with flaked almonds and accompanied by yogurt or cream.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Variation</strong>
 The quinces make a glorious dessert by themselves. Allow half a quince per person and serve cut-side up with the fragrant cooking syrup and large dollop of yogurt mixed with honey.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Buying, storing and preparing quinces</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">A ripe quince is rock hard, if the flesh is soft it is probably rotten. Avoid blemished fruit although the customary suede-like grey patches on the skin are not a problem.</p>
<p class="indent2">Golden fruit are ideal for baking and poaching in sweet or savoury dishes while the less ripe, greenish-yellow fruit are higher in pectin and perfect for the thick setting <em>Dulce de Membrillo</em>
 opposite.</p>
<p class="indent2">Once home, place the quinces in a fruit bowl allowing them to fill the kitchen with their glorious scent. Quinces will keep in the refrigerator for about a month, but do be sure to wrap them or their pervasive fragrance will taint the entire contents of the refrigerator.</p>
<p class="indent2">Peeled fruit will oxidize and brown unless you dip it in citrus juice or acidulated water. It is not usually a problem since cooked quince gains a glorious terracotta hue in any case, particularly when combined with sugar.</p>
<p class="indent2">Poach quince with a little sugar until tender, from about 20 minutes to an hour, and add to casseroles such as the lamb shanks on page 62 (omitting the olives). Baked quince is also delicious (see left).</p>

ensalada de granadas y escarola</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_27">pomegranate and curly endive salad</h1>
<p class="nonindent">It is no coincidence that Granada, Spain’s last Moorish bastion, was named after this sensual fruit since it was the Arabs who first introduced the pomegranate from Persia. Piles of exotic looking pomegranates make a wonderful spectacle in winter markets. They are invariably topped with a few alluring samples, sliced open to reveal their magenta, jewel-like seeds.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 pomegranates, seeds and juice reserved (see right)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 curly endive, washed and ripped into small pieces</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 red peppers, roasted, peeled (see page 144) and cut into ribbons</strong>
</p>
<p class="aserves0">for the dressing</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>juice of 1 lemon</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1 tsp French mustard</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Mix the dressing ingredients together with any pomegranate juice and season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p class="extract">Place the endive, pepper ribbons and half the pomegranate seeds together in a large bowl and toss with the dressing. Sprinkle with the remaining seeds and serve.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Buying and storing</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">A ripe pomegranate should feel heavy and sound almost metallic when tapped. Avoid any fruit with cracked skin that may be overripe and will soon turn bad. The colour of the pomegranate will depend on the variety – from mottled pale pink to deep red. I find that the darker fruit have consistently darker seeds that look the most dramatic as a garnish. Pomegranates benefit from a few days storage at room temperature as they become increasingly juicy and flavoursome.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Releasing the seeds</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent2">Place a sieve over a small bowl. Cut the pomegranate around its equator and give the halves a good squeeze over the sieve to loosen the seeds. Now tap the outside of the pomegranate with a spoon, allowing the juice and seeds to fall into the sieve. Make sure to throw away any white pith – it is terribly bitter.</p>
<p class="indent2">Pomegranate juice stains, so make sure you wear an apron for this job.</p>
