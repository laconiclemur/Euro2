			<p class="rec-intro">Everyone likes fritters or doughnuts once in a while and these are a real sweet temptation. They are rich though, so best for occasional consumption only. The fruit tempers the richness well and can be varied according to the season and your preference. </p>

			<p class="body">First make the cream filling. Whisk the sugar, egg and egg yolks together in a bowl, then whisk in the flour. Bring the milk to the boil in a pan with the strips of peel and pour this on to the egg mixture. Whisk well, then pour everything back into the pan and heat until boiling. It will become very thick so keep whisking to prevent the mixture sticking or burning. Line a shallow baking tray, measuring about 30 x 20cm, with cling film. Remove the orange peel from the mixture and spread it out on the lined tray. Cover and chill for about 2–3 hours until set. </p>
			<p class="body">To make the raspberry coulis for the garnish, blitz the raspberries with the 100g sugar and lemon juice to taste. Pass through a fine sieve. </p>
			<p class="body">Cut the sticks of rhubarb into pieces of about 4cm long. Melt the 80g of caster sugar in the grenadine – you may need to add a tablespoon of water. Place the rhubarb pieces in a wide pan so that they fit snugly and add the liquid. Simmer for 2–3 minutes, then carefully flip them over. Make sure not to overcook the rhubarb – it should retain a little bite.</p>
			<p class="body">Make the batter at the last moment by mixing the dry ingredients in a bowl, then whisking in the water. Pour the oil into a large pan or a deep-fat fryer and heat to 180°C.</p>
			<p class="body">Take a spoonful of the cream mixture and dip it into the batter, then carefully place it into the hot frying oil. Cook just a few beignets at a time, moving them around in the oil with a slotted spoon, for 30 seconds to a minute until golden and crisp. Take care not to overcrowd the pan. </p>
			<p class="body">Drain the beignets on kitchen paper and serve them warm with the raspberry coulis and poached rhubarb. Sprinkle with a little icing sugar before serving.</p>
