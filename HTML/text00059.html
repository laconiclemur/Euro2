<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Cookie Questions</a>
</h1>
<p class="pf">Over the years, I’ve answered lots of questions about cookies and cookie baking, and I’d like to share some tips here. Drop cookies are my favorite everyday cookies because the dough is mixed just before baking. All three of my childhood-favorite cookies fall into this category.</p>
<p>Sugar as opposed to excess shortening makes cookies spread out and get brittle. I often cut back on sugar in popular cookie recipes to improve the flavor and texture.</p>
<p>Butter is best for baking flavorful and consistently textured cookies. Margarine is unpredictable because of the different amounts of liquid and different kinds of fat in the product. Shortening itself adds no flavor to cookies, but changes the texture of cookies—you’ll notice that cookies made with shortening have a rounded edge rather than a flat edge. Some recipes call for a combination of butter for the flavor and shortening for the texture. Lately, I’ve opted for one hundred percent butter for health reasons.</p>
<p>Expect cookies made with baking powder to have a softer texture than those made with baking soda as a leavening agent. Baking soda needs to be balanced by some acid ingredient (such as lemon juice, cream of tartar, or even brown sugar) or the cookies will have a brownish color and baking soda taste. Cookie recipes that call for baking soda are usually crispy rather than soft.</p>
<p>As far as cookie sheets go, I like the thin, noninsulated, rimless kind. It doesn’t matter if the cookie sheets are dark or shiny, as I am a firm advocate of baking cookies on parchment paper because the cookies brown evenly on the top and the bottom. When I bake cookies on an insulated baking sheet, the tops brown but the bottoms don’t.</p>
<p>One last thing: if a cookie recipe calls for milk or another liquid, it is important not to overmix the batter or the cookies will be tough rather than tender.</p>

</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpil">2¼ cups all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="rpil">1 teaspoon baking soda</p>
<p class="rpil">2 sticks (1 cup) butter, softened</p>
<p class="rpil">¾ cup packed dark brown sugar</p>
<p class="rpil">½ cup granulated sugar</p>
<p class="rpil">2 large eggs</p>
<p class="rpil">1 teaspoon vanilla</p>
<p class="rpil">2 cups (12-ounce bag) semisweet chocolate chips</p>
<p class="rpill">1 cup chopped walnuts or pecans</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">Preheat the oven to 375°F or convection oven to 350°F. Cover three thin, rimless, uninsulated baking sheets with parchment paper.</p>
<p class="rp">Stir flour and baking soda together; set aside. In large bowl, blend the butter with the brown sugar and granulated sugar until creamy. Beat in the eggs and vanilla. Add the flour mixture, chocolate chips, and nuts, and mix until well blended. Drop by spoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets.</p>
<p class="rp">Bake for 10 to 11 minutes in a regular oven, or bake all three pans at the same time in the convection oven for 8 to 9 minutes.</p>
