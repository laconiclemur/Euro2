<h1 class="chapter">cheat’s spaghetti with clams</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>I was shown this cheat’s version of a clam sauce one year, which uses a jar of pre-prepared clams in brine, and thought it was delicious, despite being made in just 10 minutes. This sauce works well with spaghetti or linguine. You can also reduce the sauce on the hob and serve it as a topping for <a href="9781784881757_Split20.html#page_37">polenta</a> crostini.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 4 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>400 g (14 oz) tin Italian plum tomatoes</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>280 g (10 oz) tin clams in brine, drained</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>320 g (11½ oz) dried spaghetti</b></p>
<p class="tx3"><b>FOR THE BATTUTO</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>20 g (¾ oz) parsley leaves and fine stalks, plus a few more leaves, roughly chopped, to serve</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 small garlic clove, peeled</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt and freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>fresh red chilli, finely chopped, to taste, or ¼ teaspoon dried chilli flakes</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Make a <i><a href="9781784881757_Split13.html#page_29a">battuto</a></i> with the parsley, garlic, a good pinch of salt, a generous twist of pepper and some chilli by finely chopping them together on a board with a sharp knife.</p>
<p class="tx">Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a gentle heat, add the <i>battuto</i> and fry it for about 3 minutes until the garlic is slightly golden but not burnt. Add the tomatoes and wash the tin out with approximately 100 ml (3½ fl oz/scant ½ cup) of hot water and stir through. Break them up with a potato masher. Cook for around 20 minutes over a medium heat, adding the drained clams halfway through.</p>
<p class="tx">Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti according to the packet instructions (see <a href="9781784881757_Split24.html#page_41a">cooking dried pasta</a> for how to cook dried pasta) and time it so the pasta will be just cooked when the sauce is ready.</p>
<p class="tx">Tip the freshly cooked and drained spaghetti into the pan and toss to combine. Serve straight away with the parsley leaves.</p>
