<p class="summary"><span class="italic">The sixteenth-century Sevillian soldier and madrigalist Baltazar de Alcazár dedicated a poem to eggplants: he wrote,</span> “Tres cosas me tienen preso/de amores el corazón/la bella Inés, el jamón/y las berenjenas con queso” <span class="italic">(“Three things hold my heart a prisoner of love—the fair Inés, ham, and eggplants with cheese”). He was of Jewish descent and was proclaiming his love of ham, the most Catholic of foods, and at the same time his loyalty to an ancestral dish of eggplant and cheese that, according to the archives of the Inquisition, was considered a sign of Judaizing.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">I learned from people in Spain to steam the eggplants, which gives them a meltingly soft texture. Even the skin becomes very soft. The sauce is light and creamy, and on top is a crunchy, garlicky crust.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 large eggplant or 2 smaller ones (about 1 pound), cut lengthwise into 8 slices (about ½ inch thick)</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">1¼ cups whole milk</p>
<p class="qun">4 tablespoons (½ stick) butter</p>
<p class="qun">2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="qun">3 ounces aged Manchego or aged cheddar cheese, coarsely grated</p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup fresh bread crumbs</p>
<p class="qun">3 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley</p>
<p class="qun">1 garlic clove, crushed</p>
<p class="qun1">1 tablespoon olive oil</p>
<p class="recsum">Steam the eggplant slices in a covered steamer over boiling water for about 4 to 5 minutes, until they are very soft. Gently lift them out and arrange them in one or two layers in a baking dish. Sprinkle very lightly with salt.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Heat the milk almost to a boil.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Meanwhile, melt the butter in a medium saucepan. Add the flour and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon over low heat for 3 to 4 minutes. Pour in the milk a little at a time, stirring vigorously, until the sauce has thickened (it will not be very thick) and is smooth. Let cook gently, stirring, for 10 minutes, then gradually stir in the cheese. If necessary, add a little salt. Pour the sauce over the eggplant.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Mix the bread crumbs, parsley, garlic, and olive oil with a little salt and sprinkle over the top of the eggplant. Bake in a preheated 375°F oven for 20 minutes, then put under a hot broiler until the topping begins to color. Serve hot.</p>
