<h3 class="h3"><em>Chicken Stock</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>This is a very simple fragrant chicken stock, quickly made and wonderful to drink just as a broth or use as a base for sauces and certain soups. You can make it using either fresh chicken carcasses or, even better, those that remain from a roast chicken as well as any sticky bits left in the roasting tray. If you like, you can add a bouquet garni of thyme and bay, and if it’s a broth to beat winter that you want, just double the garlic. I prefer to let the true taste of the chicken sing out, which is why I omit the traditional</em> mirepoix <em>of carrot, celery and leek</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">MAKES A LITRE (1¾ PINTS) OR SO</span><br/>
1kg (2lb 4oz) chicken bones<br/>
2 onions, peeled and roughly chopped<br/>
6 garlic cloves, halved</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Put the chicken bones into a large pan and cover them with cold water. Bring to the boil and skim well, then add the onions and garlic. Simmer for 2 hours, skimming only if necessary. You don’t want to remove too much of the fat, as this will help the stock keep in the fridge (and can also be used for cooking). Strain the stock and it is ready to use.</p>
<p class="normala">If you want to freeze it, reduce it first by boiling (by about three-quarters) so it’ll take up less space, then you can just add a little water when you want to use it.</p>
