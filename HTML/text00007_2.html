 polenta, risotto, gnocchi</h2>
<h2 class="h2a">polenta, risotto, gnocchi</h2>
<p class="parab1">As alternatives to pasta, Italians enjoy polenta, risotto and gnocchi. Polenta is usually served as a main course or a side dish. Gnocchi and risotto, however, are served as the primo course, which comes between the antipasto and the main course. These three dishes are mainly northern Italian in character and were not very common in our household when I was growing up, although we did have our own versions of risotto and gnocchi.</p>
<div></div>
<div class="page-break"></div>
<h2 class="h2_1"><a id="page_54"></a>
 polenta</h2>
<p class="parab1">Polenta mixed with hot milk was traditionally the staple diet of the poor in the North. This is why we southerners called the people from the North <em>polentoni</em>
 (polenta eaters). When I was young, I thought polenta looked disgusting, and found it hard to believe that northerners ate it daily. I remember my mother occasionally making it for breakfast, but more often than not she used it to feed the chickens and pigs. I now know what a mistake that was, and over time I have come to consider polenta a delicacy. It is delicious accompanied by a heavy meat or mushroom ragu, or simply served with a slice of gorgonzola gently melting over the top.</p>
<p class="parab1">Cooking traditional polenta well takes a long, long time. Even in restaurants we only cooked it on special occasions, mainly because you have to tend to it for over an hour. The end result is worth it, though. The taste is magnificent after you have added flavour in the form of cheese or vegetables.</p>

 polenta concia</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">basic polenta with cheese</h3>
<p class="para1">Polenta is ground maize flour, which is cooked with water until it turns into a soft, creamy mass. Once cooked, it is flavoured with lots of butter and cheese and can be served with tomato-based ragu and stews. It can also be left to cool and set, then sliced and grilled to serve as an accompaniment to meat and game dishes. Polenta flour makes an interesting addition to cakes and biscuits instead of ordinary flour and I use it to sprinkle on baking trays when making bread.</p>
<p class="para1">To make the very best polenta, you should use the traditional variety that needs stirring continuously for about 40 minutes. The alternative is quick polenta (<em>polenta svelta</em>
 ), which takes only a few minutes to cook. It doesn’t have quite the same taste as traditional polenta but it makes a very acceptable substitute if you don’t want to stand over the stove for ages.</p>
<p class="para1">This recipe is known as <em>polenta concia</em>
 , and is flavoured with butter and cheese. You can omit these for a lighter version.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">1 litre/1¾ pints water</p>
<p class="ingre">salt</p>
<p class="ingre">200g/7oz polenta</p>
<p class="ingre">40g/1½oz/3 tbsp butter</p>
<p class="ingre">75g/3oz Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</p>
<p class="ingre1">100g/4oz Fontina cheese, cut into small cubes</p>
<p class="para1">Put the water and some salt in a medium saucepan and bring to the boil. Gradually add the polenta, stirring all the time until it has all been amalgamated. Reduce the heat, as polenta does tend to bubble quite a bit. Beware of any lumps forming and, if they do, just beat very energetically until the lumps have dissolved. Stir the polenta with a wooden spoon for 30–40 minutes, until it starts to come away from the side of the pan. If you are using quick polenta, follow the instructions on the packet. Then add the butter, Parmesan and Fontina, and mix well. Serve immediately, with a <a href="text00009.html#page_100">tomato ragu</a>
 if desired.</p>

<h3 class="h3">polenta alla griglia</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">grilled polenta</h3>
<p class="para1">Grilled polenta makes a tasty accompaniment to meat and game dishes. It can be made in advance, stored in the fridge for a couple of days and then grilled when necessary. Topped with some <a href="text00010.html#page_138">preserved vegetables</a>
 , it makes a wonderful antipasto or snack.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">1 quantity of Polenta Concia, made without the cheese (see above)</p>
<p class="ingre1">a little olive oil</p>
<p class="para1">As soon as the polenta is cooked, pour it into a lightly oiled baking tray. Leave to cool, then cut into slices or use a pastry cutter to cut into rounds.</p>
<p class="para1">Heat a charcoal grill or ridged grill pan until very hot, add the polenta and cook on both sides until crisp.</p>
<p class="para1">Alternatively, fry the polenta. Heat a non-stick frying pan until very hot, then brush with olive oil. Add the polenta and fry on both sides until crisp. The pan should be very hot before you add the polenta slices, otherwise they will stick.</p>

 gnocchi di polenta con sugo ai peperoni</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">polenta gnocchi with a red and yellow pepper sauce</h3>
<p class="para1">This is a different and more interesting way of using polenta by making the mixture into quenelles and serving them in a sauce, like pasta or gnocchi. You could make the sauce and quenelles the day before, store them in the fridge and just reheat the sauce when ready, adding the quenelles and heating through.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4–6</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">500ml/17fl oz water</p>
<p class="ingre">2 tsp salt</p>
<p class="ingre">25g/1oz/2 tbsp butter</p>
<p class="ingre">120g/4½oz quick-cook polenta</p>
<p class="ingre">25g/1oz Fontina cheese, diced</p>
<p class="ingre">25g/1oz Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>for the sauce:</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">2 anchovy fillets</p>
<p class="ingre">1 garlic cloves, squashed but left whole</p>
<p class="ingre">1 small red chilli, left whole</p>
<p class="ingre">1 red and 1 yellow pepper, roasted, skinned and sliced into <a href="text00010.html#page_139">thin strips</a>
</p>
<p class="ingre">50ml/2fl oz/4 tbsp white wine</p>
<p class="ingre">50ml/2fl oz/4 tbsp vegetable stock</p>
<p class="ingre1">scattering of fresh basil leaves, to garnish</p>
<p class="para1">First make the sauce. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan, add the anchovy fillets and cook, stirring, over a low heat until they have almost dissolved into the oil. Add the garlic and chilli and fry until the garlic becomes golden brown, then remove and discard the garlic and chilli. Add the strips of pepper and sauté for a few minutes. Pour in the wine and let it bubble until it evaporates slightly, then add the stock and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">To make the polenta gnocchi, put the water in a large saucepan with the salt and butter. Bring to the boil, stirring all the time until the butter melts. Reduce the heat and gradually add the polenta, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Cook according to the directions on the packet until you obtain a medium-thick consistency. Mix in the Fontina and Parmesan and remove from the heat.</p>
<p class="para1">Make quenelles with the polenta mixture by taking a tablespoonful of it, scooping it off the spoon with another tablespoon and then scooping it back again until it is a neat oval shape, turning the spoons against each other. Have a bowl of cold water ready by your side so that the tablespoons can be dipped in the water after each quenelle is made – this makes it easier for the quenelle to slide off the spoon.</p>
<p class="para1">Put the pepper sauce back over a medium heat. Place the quenelles in the pepper sauce and heat through. Serve immediately, scattered with a few basil leaves.</p>

 risotto</h2>
<p class="parab1">I mastered the art of making good risotto in my years travelling around Italy as a chef. After I left home, I sometimes went back to visit my family and cooked them risotto. They just couldn’t understand why you should have to spend half an hour standing by a pot, constantly stirring and adding stock. One of the reasons risotto never really took off in southern Italy was that the climate is so warm that it really isn’t comfortable to stand at a hot stove for long.</p>
<div></div>
<div class="page-break"></div>
<h3 class="h3">risotto</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">basic risotto</h3>
<p class="para1">The first rule when making risotto is to use the correct Italian rice, such as Arborio, Carnaroli or Vialone Nano, because they can absorb a huge amount of liquid without breaking up. Next, use good stock and the risotto will taste wonderful. Home-made stock is ideal but a good-quality cube or powder will suffice. Your stock can be any type, depending on the flavours you are adding. For a basic risotto, use vegetable or chicken stock. Cook the risotto at a gentle simmer and stir constantly to make sure it absorbs the liquid evenly and doesn’t stick to the pan. Add stock a little at a time, making sure that each batch has been absorbed by the rice before adding more. The stock must be hot, otherwise the risotto will stop cooking when it is added and the dish will be ruined, so keep it simmering in a separate pan. You may find you need a little more or less stock than the amount specified in the recipe, so always have a little extra ready. If you follow these few simple rules then there is no reason why you shouldn’t make successful risotto. Just like pasta, it can be a homely, comforting dish using vegetables, or a chic dinner-party affair with wild mushrooms, seafood or even truffles.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">1.5 litres/2½ pints vegetable or chicken stock</p>
<p class="ingre">3 tbsp olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">1 medium onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">375g/13oz Arborio or other Italian risotto rice</p>
<p class="ingre">50g/2oz/4 tbsp butter</p>
<p class="ingre">40g/1½oz Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</p>
<p class="ingre1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1">Put the stock in a saucepan and bring to a gentle simmer. Leave over a low heat. In a medium-sized heavy-based saucepan, heat the olive oil and sweat the onion until soft. Add the rice and stir until each grain is coated with oil. You will notice the rice becoming shiny. At this stage, add a couple of ladlefuls of the hot stock and cook, stirring all the time, until it has been absorbed. Repeat with more stock. Continue adding the stock in this way until the rice is cooked, which usually takes about 20 minutes. To check if it is done, taste the rice – it should be soft on the outside but <em>al dente</em>
 inside.</p>
<p class="para1">Remove from the heat, add the butter and Parmesan and beat well with a wooden spoon to obtain a creamy consistency. In Italy, this procedure is known as <em>mantecare</em>
 . Taste and adjust the seasoning. Leave to rest for 1 minute, then serve.</p>

 risotto con piselli, fave e zucchini</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">risotto with fresh peas, broad beans and courgettes</h3>
<p class="para1">All the flavours of spring in one dish! Obviously, if you can’t find fresh produce you could use frozen peas and beans. However, do try it with fresh ones, if possible. They are easily available in the spring, and it really does make a difference to the taste – and the texture, since fresh peas and beans are crunchier. This makes an excellent vegetarian main course.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">2 courgettes</p>
<p class="ingre">1.2 litres/2 pints vegetable stock</p>

<p class="ingre">50g/2oz/4 tbsp butter</p>
<p class="ingre">40g/1½oz Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</p>
<p class="ingre1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1">First of all prepare the courgettes. Trim off the ends, then cut off the skin in thick strips (a good 5mm/¼in thick) and discard the white flesh, which tends to be mushy (you could save it to add to vegetable stocks). Chop the green part of the courgettes very finely and set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">Put the stock in a saucepan and bring to a gentle simmer. Leave over a low heat.</p>
<p class="para1">Heat the olive oil in a medium-sized heavy-based saucepan. Add the celery and leek and sweat until softened. Add the rice and stir until each grain is coated with the oil. You will notice the rice becoming shiny. At this stage, add the wine and keep stirring, until it evaporates. Then add the peas, beans and courgettes and mix well, making sure that the vegetables do not stick to the pan. Add a couple of ladlefuls of the hot stock and cook, stirring all the time, until it has been absorbed. Repeat with more stock. Continue adding the stock in this way until the rice is cooked, which usually takes about 20 minutes. To check if it is done, taste the rice – it should be soft on the outside but <em>al dente</em>

 risotto all’accetosella</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">risotto with sorrel</h3>
<p class="para1">Sorrel has a lemony flavour and grows wild but you can also buy a cultivated variety. It’s an easy plant to grow in your garden. Usually, sorrel is added to enhance sauces that accompany fish, but its citrus tang also works extremely well with Parmesan cheese.</p>
<p class="para1">When we opened my restaurant Passione, I put this dish on the very first menu and it became one of the restaurant’s signature dishes.</p>

 risotto terrone</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">southern Italian risotto with vegetables</h3>
<p class="para1">This is the way I remember most people in the south making risotto and how my mother would make it for us.</p>
<p class="para1">It does not include butter and Parmesan and you do not follow the usual risotto method. However, it is much easier to make. The end result is similar but without the creaminess you get with the northern risotto. If you like risotto but don’t have the patience to stir it for 20 minutes, then try this alternative.</p>
<p class="para">

<p class="ingre">750ml/1¼ pints vegetable stock</p>
<p class="ingre">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingre1">freshly grated Pecorino cheese, to serve</p>
<p class="para1">Place all the vegetables in a large saucepan with the rice, olive oil and stock. Cover with a lid and bring to the boil. Then reduce the heat to very low (the contents should not even be simmering) and cook, covered, for 25 minutes. Do check the risotto from time to time to ensure that the rice is not sticking to the pan – if it does, give it a quick stir and add a little more liquid. After 25 minutes, the rice will have absorbed all the liquid and the risotto is ready to serve. Check the seasoning, sprinkle with the Pecorino and drizzle with some extra virgin olive oil, if desired.</p>

 gnocchi</h2>
<p class="parab1">We love gnocchi in the south of Italy. You will find them in restaurants all year round, served plain or with tomato sauce, game or cheese. I could happily eat them every day.</p>
<p class="parab1">My father knew how to make remarkably fine, soft gnocchi. You could taste the delicate flavour of the potato through the sauce as the gnocchi melted in your mouth. His secret was his rather dubious source of very tasty potatoes. They were grown by his friend high up on the hill under the cemetery wall in Minori. Every time we ate gnocchi my father would mention this. He said they tasted so good because the potatoes he used were full of fertiliser from the dead bodies in the cemetery. I knew it wasn’t true but was still disgusted at the thought. My father would just sit there and chuckle but my mother would get upset and say that he was being blasphemous.</p>
<p class="parab1">When I came to England, there were many varieties of potato and I was confused as to which one to use. I experimented with several until I came across the King Edward and bingo! Perfect.</p>
<p class="parab1">Gnocchi are usually made with mashed potatoes but can also be made with ricotta, pumpkin or even bread. As they tend to be quite heavy, they are best with simple sauces, such as tomato and basil, butter and sage, or pesto.</p>

 gnocchi di patate ripiene di asparagi con salsa al balsamico</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">potato gnocchi filled with asparagus with a butter and balsamic sauce</h3>
<p class="para1">If you like potato gnocchi, these are a real treat. I have used asparagus as my filling, because I find it fresh and light, but you could use a variety of ingredients – peas, broad beans, mixed vegetables, meat, mushrooms... As long as the ingredients are very finely chopped, cooked and mixed with a little grated Parmesan, you have a filling.</p>
<p class="para1">The sauce I have chosen is a classic butter and sage one, but I have added a few drops of balsamic vinegar to finish. I find the balsamic cuts the richness of the gnocchi and imparts a characteristic tangy flavour.</p>

<p class="ingre">a handful of fresh sage leaves</p>
<p class="ingre">2 tbsp freshly grated Parmesan cheese</p>
<p class="ingre1">a drizzle of balsamic vinegar</p>
<p class="para1">Place the unpeeled potatoes in a saucepan of lightly salted water, bring to the boil and simmer until tender. Keeping the potatoes whole like this means they don’t absorb water; if you prefer, you can bake them in the oven.</p>
<p class="para1">While the potatoes are cooking, make the filling. Prepare the <a href="text00007.html#page_60">courgette</a>
 and then chop the green part very finely. Heat the olive oil in a small pan, add the spring onion and sweat until softened. Then add the asparagus and courgette, and sauté over a medium heat for 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper, add the water and simmer for a few minutes, until the vegetables are tender but still a little crunchy. Place the filling mixture in a bowl, leave to cool and then stir in the Parmesan.</p>
<p class="para1">Once the potatoes are cooked, drain and leave to cool. Peel and discard the skin and mash the potatoes (preferably using a potato ricer, or ‘Italian masher’, as this gives a much smoother mash).</p>
<p class="para1">Place the mashed potato in a large bowl with the flour and cornflour. Add the eggs and some salt and mix well until you get a smooth but slightly sticky dough. Place on a floured work surface and use a rolling pin to roll out the dough into a thin sheet about 3mm/⅛in thick. Cut into rounds with a 5cm/2in pastry cutter. Place a teaspoon of the filling in the centre of half the rounds. Cover with the remaining rounds and press down the edges with your fingers to seal. Re-roll the trimmings to make more gnocchi.</p>
<p class="para1">Bring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to the boil and drop in the gnocchi. At first they will sink; as they come up to the surface, cook for a further 2 minutes (remember these are filled gnocchi and much thicker than normal ones, so they need a little longer to cook through).</p>
<p class="para1">Meanwhile, make the sauce. In a large saucepan, melt the butter over a medium heat, add the sage leaves and mix in the Parmesan. As the gnocchi are done, drain and place in the butter sauce. Mix together well. Drizzle some balsamic vinegar over the top and serve.</p>

Chop the sun-dried tomatoes very finely, almost to a pulp – if necessary, once chopped, blitz in a blender or food processor. Add the tomatoes to the potato mixture and mix well to form a soft dough. Take large pieces of the dough and roll them into sausage shapes, then slice into 2cm/¾in squares. Roll each one over the back of the tines of a fork to mark it slightly and give a traditional gnocchi shape.</p>
<p class="para1">Bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil. Meanwhile, make the sauce.

<strong>for the sauce:</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">175g/6oz butter</p>
<p class="ingre">12 fresh sage leaves, plus a few extra to garnish</p>
<p class="ingre">40g/1½oz Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</p>
<p class="ingre1">a few flaked almonds (optional)</p>
<p class="para1">Melt the butter in a saucepan over a medium heat, add the pumpkin and stir well. Reduce the heat, cover and cook until tender, stirring from time to time and adding 2–3 tablespoons of water if necessary to prevent sticking. When soft, remove the pan from the heat and tip the pumpkin into a piece of muslin. Squeeze well with your hands to extract excess liquid. Unwrap the pumpkin and whiz through a mouli-légumes, or mash with a fork or potato masher. Leave to cool.</p>
<p class="para1">Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/Gas Mark 7. Put the cooled pumpkin purée in a large bowl with all the remaining ingredients and mix well to a creamy but firm consistency. If it is too runny, add a little more flour; if it is too stiff, add another egg yolk. Put the mixture in a piping bag. The opening should be wide enough for the mixture to come out in finger-thick lengths.</p>
<p class="para1">Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil. Pipe the pumpkin mixture into 4cm/1½in long sausage shapes and drop into the boiling water. (Be careful not to burn your fingers with the steam.) When the gnocchi float up to the surface of the water, drain with a slotted spoon and place in a greased ovenproof dish.</p>
<p class="para1">To make the sauce, gently heat the butter and sage leaves in a small frying pan until the butter melts. Pour the butter and sage over the gnocchi and sprinkle with the Parmesan, together with the flaked almonds if using. Place in the oven and bake for 12 minutes or until golden brown. Garnish with extra sage leaves and serve immediately.</p>

 ndundari con salsa di pomodoro e basilico</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">pasta dumplings served with tomato and basil sauce</h3>
<p class="para1">Here is a dish that comes from my home village and is made each year to celebrate the feast of the patron saint, Santa Trofimena, on 13 July. It is said to be an old Roman recipe, and is made in the same way as potato gnocchi but uses ricotta cheese instead of potatoes, making the dumplings much lighter. Each family has its own way of making them but the basic ingredients are always ricotta, flour and eggs, while the sauce varies depending on what you like. I enjoy these dumplings with a simple <a href="text00010.html#page_142">tomato sauce</a>
 but they are equally good with <a href="text00006.html#page_44">pesto</a>
 .</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">200g/7oz Italian ‘00’ pasta flour</p>
<p class="ingre">225g/8oz ricotta cheese, well drained</p>
<p class="ingre">3 egg yolks</p>
<p class="ingre">20g/¾oz Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</p>
<p class="ingre">a pinch of ground nutmeg</p>
<p class="ingre">freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingre">
<strong>for the tomato and basil sauce:</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">2 x 400g/14oz tins of plum tomatoes, drained and chopped in half</p>
<p class="ingre">12 large fresh basil leaves</p>
<p class="ingre">6 tbsp olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">3 garlic cloves, thickly sliced</p>
<p class="ingre1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1">In a large bowl, mix the flour, ricotta, egg yolks, Parmesan, nutmeg and black pepper together to form a soft, moist dough. Place on a floured work surface and knead for 3–5 minutes, until smooth. With your hands, roll the dough into a large sausage shape and then use a knife to cut it at right angles into rectangular shapes about 2cm/¾in long.</p>
<p class="para1">Bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil and add the dumplings. Wait until they rise to the surface, then simmer for a further 2 minutes.</p>
<p class="para1">Meanwhile, make the sauce. Place the tomatoes and their juice in a bowl with half the basil, add some salt and pepper and mix well. Heat the olive oil in a large pan and add the garlic. When the garlic begins to change colour, remove the pan from the heat and add the tomato mixture. Replace on the heat and cook gently for 4 minutes, until the mixture is bubbling. Stir in the remaining basil leaves.</p>
<p class="para1">Lift the dumplings out with a slotted spoon and add to the sauce. Mix thoroughly and serve immediately.</p>
