  <p class="nonindent sgc-1"><a id="page192"></a>This menu is one of extreme simplicity, each element of which is a luxury item. It represents perfectly the ideal of a number of my French friends who claim to admire only <em>la cuisine simple</em>.</p>

  <p class="indent">There is little work involved. The pineapple should be draped in its frangipane hours earlier and need only be dipped in the batter (which also is prepared ahead of time) at the last minute. The <em>court-bouillon</em> for the lobsters may be prepared in advance and they need only be thrown in just before one goes to table. The scrambled eggs represent a few minutes’ occupation. That is all. The salad will have been prepared ahead of time and the caviar needs only the care of toasting a few thin slices of bread.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="c10-s36">THE CAVIAR</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Good caviar is large-grained, pale gray and translucent. It should be served, the container embedded in cracked ice, accompanied by thin slices of hot toast folded in a napkin to keep them warm, cold, sweet butter, and neither lemon nor onion. It is the only food I know that finds its perfect accompaniment in champagne.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_2">THE SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH FRESH TRUFFLES</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">All scrambled-egg recipes are prepared in the same manner, with the exception that, for most, the garnish, ready-cooked and hot, is added just before serving. Other particularly happy marriages are: tiny, green asparagus tips, artichoke hearts stewed in butter, still-pink sautéed chicken livers, and crayfish tails or shrimp.</p>

  <p class="indent">It is possible, although interminable, to cook scrambled eggs successfully in a heavy-bottomed saucepan or <em>sauteuse</em> over a direct, low flame, but wiser and quicker to use a <em>bain-marie</em>, the water kept just below the boiling point. Because the hot water contacts the sides as well as the bottom of the saucepan in which the eggs are cooked, they absorb heat through a much more extended surface.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page193"></a>Perfect scrambled eggs are creamy and absolutely consistent in texture, not so thick that they cannot be poured, but thick enough to hold their form, once served. The additional yolks, the passage through the sieve, the quantity of butter used, the addition of cream and the constant stirring in contact with low heat are all details directed toward this end.</p>

  <p class="indent">Any receptacle with fairly low sides (3 to 4 inches high), enough larger than the saucepan to easily contain it and largely surround it with water, will do well for the <em>bain-marie</em>. A large <em>sauteuse</em> is perfect, but a high-sided cake tin or the bottom of a covered roasting pan will do as well. Lacking any of these, one may simply use a larger saucepan, but the work is harder, for, because of its high sides, the smaller saucepan must be held constantly, floating, in a larger quantity of water. Fill the chosen receptacle with enough water to immerse the saucepan about halfway or less, depending on the level reached by the eggs.</p>

  <p class="indent">The croutons may be prepared somewhat ahead of time and kept warm—or rewarmed in a slow oven.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c10-s37"><em><span class="color">Scrambled Eggs with Fresh Truffles</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Oeufs Brouillés aux Truffes Fraîches</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="extract"><em>Croutons:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 thick slices stale white bread</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about 4 tablespoons</em> (<em>2 ounces) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>at least</em> 3 <em>ounces fresh truffles</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>6 tablespoons (3 ounces) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>8 eggs plus 3 or 4 yolks</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, freshly ground pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>⅓ cup heavy cream</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE CROUTONS</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">But for a slight edge of sweetness, the commercialized “deluxe” type of American white bread, firm, heavy-textured, and unsliced (the slices are too thin)—or, of course, homemade American bread—is perfect <a id="page194"></a>material for croutons. The result is best if it is a bit stale—half dried out, but still easy to cut.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cut 3 slices of bread, each somewhat over ½ inch thick, slice off the crusts, and cut the slices into cubes. Melt the butter in a heavy frying pan or <em>sauteuse</em>, the bottom surface of which is just the right size to hold the bread cubes comfortably. Cook them over a flame, turning them regularly until they are crisp and golden on all sides, adding more butter if necessary. The butter must absolutely not be allowed to burn (if it is clarified, there is no risk, but this is pointless, since, if the heat is kept low enough and the croutons constantly surveyed, they are better as described).</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE TRUFFLES</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">These may or may not be peeled. Cut them into slices fully ⅛ inch thick. The quality of the dish remains unchanged, but the presentation is handsomer if one keeps aside a few thinner slices, cooked gently for 2 or 3 minutes in a bit of butter and Madeira, port, sherry, or cognac, to be used as garnish. Even the finest, firmest, blackest fresh truffles are never as jet-black as when cooked in this way.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE EGGS</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Thickly butter the bottom and the sides of the saucepan with about ½ of the amount of butter prescribed. Cut the rest into small pieces. Beat the eggs with a fork until thoroughly mixed—no longer—and pass them through a fine sieve, to remove the firm fragments of white which never mix with the rest, directly into the saucepan, add the seasoning, the raw, sliced truffles and the remaining butter. Bring the water in the <em>bain-marie</em> receptacle to a boil and immerse the saucepan. The flame may be left high until the water again approaches the boiling point, then adjust it so that the water remains close to a simmer. Stir the eggs with a wooden spoon continuously, being careful to regularly scrape the entire surface of sides, corners, and bottom. Toward the end of the cooking, when they have noticeably begun to thicken, remove the saucepan from the water 2 or 3 times, continuing to stir (this prevents the thickening process, finally very rapid, from “getting ahead of you”). As they approach the proper consistency, remove <a id="page195"></a>the pan from the water, continue stirring (for the eggs continue to cook from the heat contained in the pan), pouring in a little cream, which will stop the thickening process and, in case they have become a bit too thick, bring them back to the right consistency. Be gentle with the addition of cream, for if too much is added, the eggs may be irremediably thinned—however, they will still be delicious. Stir in the croutons, pour onto a warmed (but not hot) serving platter, decorate the surface with the cooked truffles slices, and serve immediately.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_3">THE LOBSTERS A LA NAGE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">The “purest” way to prepare lobster is simply to boil it in sea water. <em>A la nage</em> is “next purest” and better. The replacement of tap water by sea water or, in either case, the use of sea salt for seasoning, is a valid refinement.</p>

  <p class="indent">Lobsters may be prepared in precisely the same way to be served cold (allowed to cool in the <em>court-bouillon</em>). The butter in this case should be replaced by one of the mayonnaise derivatives (<em>tartare</em>, Vincent or <em>rémoulade</em>).</p>

  <p class="indent">Although its preparation is not time-consuming, the <em>court-bouillon</em> may be prepared in advance and reheated at the last moment. Any that is left over may be strained, refrigerated and used for the poaching of other fish or as a stock base for a bisque or other fish soup or sauce.</p>

  <p class="indent">Normally the lobsters are decorated with some of the vegetables of the <em>court-bouillon</em>, in which case the carrots are more presentable if peeled with a canaliculated knife. The presence of white wine turns them a dirty color and a clever restaurant practice is to replace this garnish by a handful of canaliculated (finely sliced and ridged) carrots and a fresh bouquet of parsley that have been plunged for a couple of minutes in salted boiling water. The bright green and orange splashed against the red-and-white lobster is spectacular, but I prefer the flavorful gray carrots. The unsightly gray straggles of parsley from the bouillon may be replaced by small bouquets of fresh parsley.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c10-s38"><a id="page196"></a><em><span class="color">Lobsters à la Nage</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Homards Tièdes à la Nage</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="extract"><em>Court-bouillon:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 bottle good, dry white wine</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 cups water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 onions, thinly sliced crosswise (rings)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 carrots, ridged and sliced thinly</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 small handful coarse salt (sea salt if available)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>a large pinch of whole peppercorns</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>a small pinch of Cayenne pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>a healthy bouquet of parsley, a pinch of thyme, a pinch of oregano, a branch of fennel</em> (<em>or seeds</em>) <em>and a bay leaf</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 large or 4 small and lively lobsters</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>6 to 8 ounces sweet butter</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Prepare the <em>court-bouillon</em> in a pot with a tight-fitting lid, just large enough to hold the lobsters easily. A large enameled cast-iron casserole or <em>marmite</em> is practical. Bring the liquids to a boil, add all the other ingredients except the lobsters and the butter, and leave to simmer, covered, for 20 to 30 minutes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Fifteen minutes before going to table, plunge the live lobsters into the pot, make certain that they are as nearly covered with the liquid as possible, bring back to a boil, cover the pot and lower the flame. Turn them over in their liquid halfway through the cooking process (10 to 15 minutes in all, depending on the size of the lobsters). Remove from the heat and leave them, covered, in the <em>court-bouillon</em>.</p>

  <p class="indent">To serve, twist off and crack the claws, but leave them intact. Spread out the body, face down, on the chopping board and, piercing it through the upper part of the carapace with a large, pointed knife, split it in two lengthwise. Tear out and discard the gravel sack (“queen”) from the upper tip of the head, and arrange the halves, split surface up, surrounded by the claws, on a large serving platter. Remove the parsley from the <em>court-bouillon</em> and pour over the lobsters a ladleful of <em>court-bouillon</em> containing onion rings and carrot slices. Decorate with bouquets of fresh parsley and send to table, separately, a sauceboat of melted butter into which several tablespoons of <em>court-bouillon</em> <a id="page197"></a>have been incorporated. (I usually place a small sauce-pan containing butter and <em>court-bouillon</em> directly in the pot with the lobsters after they have finished cooking; it is thus automatically ready.) Lobster crackers and a plate or bowl to receive the shells at the table should not be forgotten. Finger bowls are more or less obligatory, for lobster in its shell cannot be eaten otherwise than with one’s fingers.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c10-s39"><em><span class="color">Pineapple and Frangipane Fritters</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Beignets d’Ananas à la Frangipane</p>

  <p class="nonindent">The frangipane and the pineapple should be prepared a few hours ahead of time.</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="extract"><em>Frangipane:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup milk</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>few drops of vanilla extract</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 tablespoons sugar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>5 tablespoons flour</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>small pinch of salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 whole egg and 1 egg yolk</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 dried-out almond macaroons (not coconut)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 tablespoons (1 ounce) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon coarsely chopped pistachio nuts (first dipped for a minute in boiling water and rubbed in a towel to remove the skins)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>half a fresh pineapple</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Frying batter:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 egg</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>⅓ cup flour</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>pinch of salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 teaspoon sugar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>⅓ cup warm beer</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 ounce melted butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>a bit of water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>oil for deep frying</em> (<em>preferably light olive oil, but a tasteless vegetable oil will do</em>)</p>
  </div>

  <p class="center"><a id="page198"></a><span class="small">THE FRANGIPANE</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Bring the milk to a boil with the vanilla and sugar and leave to cool slightly. Sift the flour and salt into a saucepan, add the whole egg and the yolk and stir, keeping the motion to the center, with a wooden spoon so that the flour is slowly absorbed into the egg, then slowly add the milk, stirring all the time. Cook over a medium flame, continuing to stir vigorously, until the mixture becomes very thick. Remove from the heat, crumble in the macaroons, add the butter and the chopped pistachio nuts, mix well and leave to cool.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE PINEAPPLE</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Cut the pineapple in slices of from ⅓ to ½ inch thick; cut each slice in quarters, slice off the rind and remove the woody core. Butter a plate, spread half the frangipane over the surface, arrange the pineapple sections on top, and cover with the remaining frangipane so that each pineapple section is completely coated. Put to chill until needed.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE FRYING BATTER</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Prepare the batter an hour or so before the meal. It must “relax” to lose its elasticity; otherwise it refuses to properly coat the object to be fried.</p>

  <p class="indent">Separate the yolk from the white of the egg and put the latter aside. Add the yolk to the dry ingredients and stir in the beer, adding it at 2 or 3 intervals. Stir only until a regular consistency is achieved. Never beat—the more a batter is “worked,” the greater its elasticity. Stir in the melted butter and enough water to bring it to the consistency of fresh heavy cream. Kept this thin, there will be a greater loss of batter in the frying oil, but the crispness and delicacy of the fritters will be assured. Leave batter covered with a plate, at kitchen temperature, until needed; it should never be refrigerated, for a slight fermentation should take place. At the last minute, gently fold in the stiffly beaten egg white.</p>

  <p class="indent">Heat the frying oil; when it sizzles at contact with a drop of batter, it is ready. Do not use a frying basket. Carefully cut loose, one from the other, the frangipane-covered pineapple sections and, one at a time, <a id="page199"></a>drop them from a spoon into the batter, lift them out and drop them into the hot oil. Don’t try to fry too many at a time. Delicately turn them over in the oil with the prong tips of a fork, and when they are golden and crisp on both sides, scoop them out with a large skimming spoon. Drain them on paper towels and transfer them to the folded napkin in which they will be served. When all are fried, sprinkle the surface with powdered sugar and serve immediately.</p>
