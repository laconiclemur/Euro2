			<p class="rec-intro">I couldn’t write a book of French classics without doffing my chef’s hat to this wonderful dessert, created by Escoffier for the famous actress of the day. You can serve this in one large bowl but it looks wonderfully retro in individual glasses.</p>

			<p class="ing-nu">2 thinly pared strips of orange peel</p>

			<p class="body">To make the pineapple sorbet, peel the pineapple and dice the flesh. Put this in a pan with the sugar, glucose and lemon juice and bring it to the boil, then blitz until smooth in a food processor. Freeze in an ice-cream machine. Alternatively, you can spoon the mixture into a tray, cover and leave in the freezer to set, mixing every 30 minutes until smooth.</p>
			<p class="body">To make the mousse, whisk the yolks and sugar together in a bowl. Bring the milk to the boil with the orange peel, then pour this on to the yolks and mix well. Tip the mixture back into the pan and cook carefully until it thickens. Place the gelatine in a saucer of cold water until it softens, then squeeze out the excess water. Add the softened gelatine and the Curaçao to the egg mixture, then pass through a fine sieve. Leave to cool and when almost set fold in the whipped cream. Refrigerate until firm.</p>
			<p class="body">Hull the strawberries and cut them in half or quarters if large. Douse with the brandy and Curaçao, then cover and refrigerate for at least an hour. </p>
			<p class="body">To serve, spoon some of the pineapple sorbet into each dish followed by the strawberries and juices, then top with some Curaçao mousse. Decorate with some spun sugar if you like.</p>
			<p class="body">To make spun sugar, melt 200 grams of caster sugar in a frying pan until it turns golden brown – watch it carefully and don’t let it burn. Remove the pan from the heat and use a fork to flick the sugar back and forth over a greased wooden spoon or ladle to make a fragile cage.</p>
