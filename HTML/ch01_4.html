<h3 class="h3a">CASTILE – LEON</h3>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">FAST FACTS</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">The ancient kingdom of Castilla y León today makes up Spain’s largest autonomous region (Spain is divided into nineteen <em>comunidades autónomas,</em> which are subdivided into provinces). North and northwest of Madrid, this sweep of territory takes in parched plains, mountains and valleys, and hilltop castles and sleepy villages, as well as stunning historic towns like Burgos, Segovia, Salamanca, Avila, and León. To many Castile-León is the very cradle of modern Spanish culture. Although Madrid, Spain’s worldly capital, is located within Castile, it has been given autonomous status.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">FOOD</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Classic Castilian cuisine is full of austere elegance, dominated by smoky <em>embutidos</em> (charcuterie), beans, lentils and chickpeas, garlic, and paprika. Macho meat reigns supreme here, especially suckling lamb and crisp-skinned baby pig roasted in wood-burning ovens.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_4"/><span class="blue"><strong>Traditional specialties:</strong></span> <em>Lechazo</em> (roast suckling lamb); <em>cochinillo asado</em> (roast suckling pig); <em>cocido</em> (boiled dinner); bean and sausage <em>potajes</em> (stews); <em>albóndigas en salsa</em> (saucy meatballs); <em>gallina en pepitoria</em> (hen in almond sauce); tripe with chickpeas and sausages; <em>tortillas</em> and <em>revueltos</em> (filled omelets and scrambled eggs)</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">WINE</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Located along the Duero river, Castile’s Ribera del Duero DO (denomination of origin) is the source of Spain’s most aristocratic, beautifully structured reds. From the Rueda DO in the province of Valladolid come crisp, well-balanced whites featuring the delightful verdejo grape. Castile’s new wine powerhouse is the DO Toro, a hot, semiarid area around Zamora that produces big bold reds. Bierzo, another emerging wine region, has also been getting critical raves for its complex aromatic reds starring the local mencía grape.</p>

<h3 class="h3a">LA MANCHA</h3>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">FAST FACTS</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">La Mancha (officially Castilla-La Mancha) is the vast windswept swath of Spain’s central <em>meseta</em> where a certain Cervantes character famously battled the windmills. The Moors called it <em>manxa</em>—dry earth—because in Spain the rain does <em>not</em> often fall on the plain. This predominantly rural region of vineyards, olive groves, poppy fields—and many sheep—is also home to towns like Toledo, La Mancha’s stunningly historic capital, and Cuenca, famed for its “hanging houses” dramatically etched into cliffs.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">FOOD</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Suffused with paprika, garlic and saffron, for which the region is famous, the sturdy cuisine of La Mancha has much in common with the food of Castile. As elsewhere in Spain, creative chefs here are reinventing regional flavors.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>Traditional Specialties:</strong></span> <em>Pisto manchego</em> (a tomatoey vegetable stew); <em>sopa de ajo</em> (garlic and bread soup); <em>bacalao al ajo arriero</em> (a salt cod dish similar to bran-dade); <em>morteruelo</em> (warm game pâté); partridge either stewed or in <em>escabeche; migas</em> (fried bread bits); <em>marzipán; alajú</em> (a bread crumb, almond, and honey confection)</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="page_5"/><span class="blue">WINE</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">As Europe’s largest demarcated wine region, once known for bulk wines, today DO La Mancha is in the midst of a viticultural revolution. Airén, a local white grape, has traditionally predominated, but these days red varieties, such as cencibel (tempranillo), cabernet sauvignon, merlot, and syrah, often blended, are getting more and more play. The better new-wave La Mancha reds tend to be internationally styled but still possess plenty of <em>terroir.</em> Valdepeñas, a classic DO in southern La Mancha is likewise graduating from jug wines to quality reds.</p>

<h3 class="h3a">EXTREMADURA</h3>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">FAST FACTS</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">A broad expanse of harsh but oddly majestic terrain, this western region bordering Portugal is Spain’s own wild west. Extremadura is best known as the land of conquistadores, explorers who in the sixteenth century left their destitute hometowns to seek fortunes in the New World. The treasures they brought back fueled the construction of the churches and mansions in the cities of Trujillo and Cáceres. Mérida is another gem of a town notable for its ancient Roman remains and a striking Roman art museum designed by the architect Rafael Moneo. Extremadura’s lush La Vera valley is one of the prettiest corners of Spain.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">FOOD</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">With the same rough-hewn smoky identity as the cooking of Castile and La Mancha, <em>extremeño</em> is a peasant cuisine, centered on pork, lamb, and game dishes and lots of dried peppers and leftover bread. The best-known regional products include <em>pimentón de la Vera,</em> Spain’s inimitable smoked paprika; outstanding cheeses like Torta del Casar; and spectacular cured pork made from the prized <em>ibérico</em> pigs that feed on acorns in the local forests.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>Traditional Specialties:</strong></span> Potatoes in <em>escabeche</em>; tomato and fig soup; <em>caldereta de cordero</em> (paprika-flavored lamb casserole); <em>frite</em> (lamb stews); <em>migas</em> (fried bread bits)</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">WINE</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Still virtually unknown in America, the fruity reds from the Extemaduran DO of Ribera del Guadiana are gradually gaining a following among Spanish wine aficionados. Given the recent success of Spain’s other formerly obscure wine-growing areas, this is a region to watch.</p>

<h3 class="h3c"><a id="page_6"/>THE NORTHERN COAST</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">BASQUE COUNTRY</h3>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">FAST FACTS</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Situated on the Cantabrian coast just west of the French border, the Basque Country—País Vasco in Spanish, Euskadi in Basque—is a land of pastoral hills swathed in eye-popping green and wide sandy beaches hugging the Bay of Biscay. Ferociously independent, the Basques are proud of their inscrutable tongue, Euskera, which has no known linguistic relatives, proud of the theories that claim them as Europe’s most ancient ethnic group, and especially proud of their amazing cuisine. San Sebastián, Spain’s epicurean capital, is also notable for its gorgeous shell-shaped bay called La Concha. Bilbao, formerly a sooty industrial seaport, has undergone a stunning urban renewal following the construction of the Guggenheim museum designed by Frank Gehry.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">FOOD</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Many Spanish gastronomic pilgrims call País Vasco mecca. Historically prodigious fishermen, shepherds and farmers, the Basques today enjoy one of Europe’s highest standards of living and happily spend every last euro on food. Classic Basque dishes tend to be hearty and straightforward, featuring the highest-quality bacalao, pristine fish and shellfish, wild mushrooms, and bright dewy vegetables. But Basque Country is also the birthplace of Spain’s <em>nueva cocina</em> and continues to be a hotbed of experimental gastronomic activity.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>Traditional Specialties:</strong></span> <em>Bacalao al pil pil</em> (cod with garlic and an olive oil emulsion); <em>bacalao a la vizcaína</em> (cod in red pepper sauce); <em>marmitako</em> (bonito and potato stew); <em>merluza en salsa verde</em> (hake in green sauce); <em>chipirón encebollado</em> (squid in onion sauce); grilled turbot; <em>alubias de Tolosa</em> (red bean and smoked meats stew); <em>pastel vasco</em> (cream or cherry-filled tart)</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">WINE</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">The traditional Basque Country wine is Txakolí, a simple but quaffable slightly pétillant white that goes perfectly with local seafood and <em>pintxos</em> (tapas). However, Rioja Alavesa—the Basque section of the Rioja wine region—supplies far more serious bottlings mainly featuring the classic Rioja grape, tempranillo.</p>

<h3 class="h3a">ASTURIAS AND CANTABRIA</h3>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">FAST FACTS</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Located between the Basque Country to the east and Galicia to the west, Asturias and Cantabria share a beautiful stretch of the rocky Cantabrian coastline and a sizable chunk of the dramatically scenic Picos de Europa, one of Europe’s last great mountain wildernesses. Asturias, with two major cities, Gijón and Oviedo, is a former kingdom famous for having never been conquered by the Arabs. (The Moors were bravely defeated here in the eighth century at the battle of Covadonga.) Although Cantabria’s past is a bit less heroic, the region is the proud home of a priceless historic treasure: the Altamira caves, which are covered with breathtaking Paleolithic paintings more than 15,000 years old. Santander, Cantabria’s fun seaside capital, is a major university town.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">FOOD</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Fishing, farming, sausage making, and some extremely serious cheese production in the Picos de Europa shape the cuisines of Cantabria and Asturias. Asturian is largely a mountain cuisine, highlighting beans and smoked pork, with seafood enjoyed mainly along the coast. The mild, hearty <a id="page_8"/>cooking of Cantabria is bound to the sea, the source of anchovies, sardines, spider crabs, tuna, and hake.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>Traditional Specialties:</strong></span> <em>Fabada</em> (bean and sausage casserole); <em>pote asturiano</em> (a stew of cabbage and smoked meats); chicken, chorizo, or hake braised in hard cider; <em>almejas a la marinera</em> (clams in wine sauce); <em>fabes con almejas</em> (white beans with clams); <em>arroz marinero</em> (seafood-studded rice); <em>arroz con leche</em> (rice pudding); <em>quesada pasiega</em> (cheese tart)</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">WINE</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Asturias and Cantabria are the two Spanish regions without any serious winemaking tradition (the terrain isn’t conducive to cultivating vines). They make up for it by drinking huge quantities of <em>sidra,</em> the fermented hard apple cider traditionally poured into wide glasses from great heights.</p>
<p class="pagebreak"> </p>
<h3 class="h3a">GALACIA</h3>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">FAST FACTS</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Occupying the country’s northwestern corner, rainy green Galicia is miles away both in spirit and distance from the sun-splashed Spain of <em>toreros</em> and castanets (here they actually play bagpipes). A region with a Celtic heritage and landscapes that look more Irish than Iberian, Galicia has spectacular scenery: <em>rías</em> (fjordlike estuaries), lagoons, rocky coves, and lush swaths of emerald countryside dotted with stone crosses and <em>hórreos</em> (raised granaries). The Romanesque cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, Galicia’s capital, attracts scores of pilgrims who walk there all the way from France along the Camino de Santiago, or Saint James Way.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">FOOD</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Seafood, usually cooked with minimum fuss, is Galicia’s forte—from the prehistoric looking and stunningly expensive <em>percebes</em> (goose barnacles) to spider crabs, mussels, scallops, and exquisite Carril clams. The agriculturally minded region also has fabulous eggs, dairy products, potatoes, and Spain’s greatest beef. <em>Grelos</em> (turnip greens) are omnipresent.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>Traditional Specialties:</strong></span> Seafood and meat empanadas; <em>pulpo a feira</em> (paprika-dusted boiled octopus served on a wooden board); <em>caldo gallego</em> (a hearty white bean and smoked meat soup); <em>lacón con grelos</em> (cured ham with turnip greens); <em>filloas</em> (sweet crepes); <em>tarta de Santiago</em> (a tartlike almond cake)</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">WINE</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Albariño, the elegant Galician white, is quite the star of the international wine world. Produced in the picturesque Rías Baixas area close to the Atlantic, albariños tend to be fresh tasting and faintly flowery—a perfect pairing for seafood. Overshadowed by the Rías Baixas, Ribeiro, Galicia’s older and more traditional DO, is making a comeback with interesting bottlings made with native red and white grapes.</p>

<h3 class="h3a">ARAGON</h3>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">FAST FACTS</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Rugged and remote, Aragon is surrounded by Castile and Navarra to the west, Catalonia to the east, and the Pyrenees to the north. It’s famous for the mountain scenery in the north and its two royal residents—Catherine of Aragon, who was married to Henry VIII, and Ferdinand of Aragon, who together with his devoutly Catholic wife, Isabella of Castile, oversaw the defeat of the Moors at Granada and unified Spain in the fifteenth century. Zaragoza, the Aragonese capital, has a much-venerated basilica dedicated to the Virgin of the Pillar and an unbelievably happening bar scene.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">FOOD</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Aragonese cuisine is as delightfully bracing as its landscape, showcasing lamb, pork, olive oil, the delicious local Teruel ham, and trout from Pyrenean streams. Many dishes also feature the region’s prized vegetables and fruit—especially peaches.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>Traditional Specialties:</strong></span> <em>Ternasco asado</em> (roast lamb); chicken and lamb <em>chilindrón</em> (in a red pepper sauce); <em>magro con tomate</em> (fried smoked ham with tomato sauce); partridge with chocolate sauce; cardoons in almond sauce; <em>frutas escarchadas</em> (candied fruit dipped in chocolate); peaches in wine</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">WINE</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Nobody took Aragon’s wines seriously until the late nineties, when the DO Somontano, a region at the foothills of the Pyrenees, exploded onto the international scene. The combination of bold, intelligent, and decidedly modern wine-making and a cool mountain climate uncharacteristic of Spain results in elegant bottlings made from an unusual range of grapes: the indigenous alcañon, as well as gewürztraminer and chardonnay for whites, the traditional moristel, along with the not-so-classic merlot, cabernet savignon, and even pinot noir for reds.</p>

<h3 class="h3a">LA RIOJA AND NAVARRA</h3>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">FAST FACTS</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Northeast of Madrid lie the fertile agricultural regions of Navarra and La Rioja, where vines and vegetables are the two major industries. Both regions are traversed by the Camino de Santiago, an important Medieval pilgrimage route, and abound in Romanesque and Gothic churches and monasteries set amid gentle pastoral hillsides or in ancient walled towns. A major kingdom in the Middle Ages, today Navarra is famous for the raucous running of the bulls during the festival of San Fermin in Pamplona, its capital. La Rioja’s fame is, of course, fueled by wine.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">FOOD</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">The abundant <em>huertas,</em> or market gardens, of the lush Ebro valley supply Navarese and Riojan kitchens with extraordinary artichokes, asparagus, leeks, chard, tender lettuce hearts, and the delicate white beans called <em>pochas.</em> The vegetables show up in salads, fried in a light batter, or cooked into <em>menestras</em> (vegetable stews); they are also packed into gourmet jars and cans and sold all over Spain. Red peppers, both dried and fresh, are another signature staple, particularly piquillos, which can be either stuffed with seafood or meat or gently sautéed with garlic and olive oil. Potatoes make a frequent appearance, as do chorizo sausage, lamb, and bacalao.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>Traditional Specialties:</strong></span> <em>Espárragos en vinagreta</em> (asparagus in vinaigrette); <em>menestra de verduras</em> (a mélange of stewed and fried vegetables); baby lamb chops grilled over vine cuttings; <em>patatas a la riojana</em> (potato and chorizo stew); white bean stew with quail; stuffed peppers</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">WINE</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Rioja is Spain’s most famous wine region. Its defining grape is the early-ripening tempranillo, which is frequently blended with grenache, mazuelo (carignan) and the aromatic graciano. Responding to competition from other emerging wine areas, Rioja’s vintners are now offering wines in a range of styles, from the soft, light classic-style reds to richer, redder, fruitier new-wave bottlings. Rioja’s citrusy whites should not be overlooked either—ditto wines from Navarra. Known mainly for its pleasant rosés, Navarra is successfully experimenting with more ambitious international-style wines made from French grape varieties.</p>

<h3 class="h3a">CATALONIA</h3>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">FAST FACTS</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">“No, not Spanish, <em>Catalan</em>”—this rebuke echoes all over Spain’s northeastern corner, startling a visitor primed for flamenco, sangria, and tapas. A country within a country, with its own language, complex history, and a wealth of artistic traditions, Catalonia—Catalunya to the natives—has more in common with neighboring France than with the arid, macho Castile. One can spend an eternity in Barcelona, the region’s buoyantly cosmopolitan capital, admiring the brooding medieval quarter, the wacky architecture of Gaudí, and one of the world’s greatest food markets, La Boqueria. But this would mean missing Catalonia’s other attractions, among them ramshackle Romanesque churches surrounded by snow-capped Pyrenean peaks, some 250 miles of lyrical Mediterranean coastline, walled medieval villages, Roman ruins, and Dalí’s outlandish museum in Figueres.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">FOOD</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Catalan food blends Roman, Arabic and even Italian influences into one of Europe’s most distinct and emphatic cuisines, which today runs the gamut from rustic to ultra-refined. This is the turf of Ferran Adrià and his experimental disciples and of elegant modern-Mediterranean seafood <em>cocina.</em> Yet Catalan cooking is also about robust grills spiked with garlicky <em>allioli,</em> bracing rice dishes, rust-colored fisherman’s stews, and inland casseroles in which seafood, poultry, or the beloved bacalao might be funkily paired with honey, dried fruit, or even chocolate. Barcelona’s restaurant scene can give any world capital a run for its money.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>Traditional Specialties:</strong></span> <em>Samfaina</em> (a kind of ratatouille); <em>escalivada</em> (grilled vegetables); rice casseroles; <em>rossejat de fideus</em> (toasted pasta casserole); duck with pears; rabbit with <em>allioli</em>; <em>mar i muntanya</em> (chicken and shellfish); <em>suquet</em> (seafood in tomato-based sauce); <em>romesco</em> (red pepper sauce with nuts); cannelloni; <em>cocas</em> (topped flatbreads); <em>crema catalana</em> (a sort of crème brûlee)</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">WINE</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Wine-wise, Catalonia is a powerhouse. The wine world is abuzz over the big, dark, expensive reds from the once obscure Priorat region. Penedès, one of Spain’s oldest wine-producing areas, is playing catch-up with its own new-style reds produced <a id="page_12"/>alongside the more traditional rosés and dessert wines. Penedès is also famous for <em>cava,</em> a bubbly made by <em>méthode champenoise,</em> usually from a blend of three native grapes.

<h3 class="h3a">EL LEVANTE</h3>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">FAST FACTS</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">The Levante (land of the rising sun) is the collective name for the provinces of Castellón,Valencia, and Alicante, plus the autonomous region of Murcia, which stretch along Spain’s Mediterranean seaboard between Catalonia to the north and Andalusia to the south. The region is often called the garden of Spain, thanks to alluvial plains that support acres of extraordinary fertile farmland, rice paddies, and orange and almond orchards that have been cultivated since the time of the Arabs. Farming, fishing, and beach tourism are among the region’s economic mainstays. Valencia, Spain’s flamboyant third largest city, is the home of paella—as well as a splendid cathedral which claims to possess the Holy Grail; the futuristic City of Arts and Sciences designed by architect Santiago Calatrava; and a fiery fiesta called Las Fallas.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">FOOD</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Paella, the gastronomic emblem of the Levante, is actually just one of its myriad scrumptious rice dishes. Seafood, almonds, artichokes, tomatoes, and peppers also show up in many local specialties. Salt curing fish has been a major business in the Levante since antiquity, and the pungent flavors of <em>mojama</em> (salted tuna) and anchovies remain as popular today as they were in Roman times. The region is also the source of <em>turrón</em> (almond and honey nougat) and <em>horchata,</em> a delightful milky summer refresher made from nutlike tubers called <em>chufas.</em></p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>Traditional Specialties:</strong></span> Paella; <em>arroz a banda</em> (seafood-flavored rice served in two courses); <em>arroz negro</em> (black rice); <em>arròs amb fesols i naps</em> (rice with beans, turnips, and meat); <em>fideuá</em> (pasta paella); <em>alli-pebre de anguilas</em> (eel in garlic sauce); <em>caldero murciano</em> (Murcian rice and seafood casserole)</p>

<p class="noindent">Levante reds are yet another recent Spanish success story, particularly the wines from the hot, dry Jumilla DO in Murcia. Here up-and-coming vintners are experimenting with bold mouth-filling reds made from syrah, along with more traditional grapes like monastrell (mourvèdre) and grenache.

<h3 class="h3a">ANDALUSIA</h3>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">FAST FACTS</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Ever seen tourist posters of Spain? That was probably Andalusia—the peninsula’s sultry south, synonymous with flamenco and bullfighting, tapas and sherry, tiled patios scented with orange blossoms, histrionic religious processions, and yes, mass-tourism that has pretty much ruined the beaches of the Costa del Sol. The legacy of the Arabs who ruled here for almost eight centuries is every-where—in the blindingly white hilltop villages; in the flamenco music and the proverbially languorous lifestyle; in the architectural landmarks of Granada, Seville, and Córdoba, Andalusia’s great cultural centers. Roughly the size of Portugal, with a landscape that takes in Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts as well as the high peaks of the Sierra Nevada, Andalusia often feels like its own planet.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">FOOD</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">With its mosaic of tapas, coral-pink gazpachos, lacy fried fish, Jabugo ham, olive oil, and saffron-tinged seafood stews, Andalusian cooking is full of rustic pizzaz. Its Arab roots are evident in the liberal use of spices like cumin and confections rich in honey and nuts. Catholic nuns at Andalusian convents are still busy perfecting recipes for sweets, some of which go back to the fifteenth century.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>Traditional Specialties:</strong></span> Gazpacho; <em>caracoles en salsa</em> (spicy snails); oxtail stew; <em>pescaíto frito</em> (fried fish); <em>espinacas con garbanzos</em> (spinach with chickpeas); <em>alboronía</em> (vegetable stew); <em>papas aliñas</em> (marinated potatoes); <em>yemas</em> (candied egg yolk confections); <em>pestiños</em> (sweet fried pastries)</p>

<h3 class="h3c"><a id="page_14"/>THE ISLANDS</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">THE BALEARIC ISLANDS</h3>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">FAST FACTS</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">The islands of Mallorca, Menorca, and Ibiza are moored in the azure Mediterranean waters off Spain’s eastern coast. Closely related to Catalonia in language and culture, the Balearics have been visited by Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, and Arabs, all of whom left their traces. (Pirates came, too.) Today the islands are colonized by vacationers who outnumber locals 15 to 1 in high season. White-washed Ibiza relishes its reputation as Europe’s clubby summer playground. Mallorca with its secluded coves, beaches, and romantically lush interior has attracted celebrity couples like Chopin and George Sand, and Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, who even bought property. Menorca, formerly in British control, is the place to get away from the crowds.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">FOOD</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Although authentic island cuisine is being edged out by pizza parlors, those who stray off the tourist trail are rewarded with bold-flavored hyper-Mediterranean cooking that makes abundant and often surprising use of fish, olive oil, and the beautifully sweet local peppers and eggplants. The omnipresent pork shows up as <em>sobrasada</em>—the soft Mallorcan paprika-flavored sausage paste—and as lard, the secret behind the incredible crumbliness of sweet and savory island pastries, such as <em>cocas</em> and <em>cocarrois.</em> The sweet flavors that so often sneak into savory dishes are an Arab legacy.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>Traditional Specialties:</strong></span> <em>Tumbet</em> (eggplant casserole); <em>sopes mallorquines</em> (bread and vegetable stew); <em>caldereta de langosta</em> (lobster stew); stuffed vegetables; <em>frit</em> (stir-fried offal); <em>arroz brut</em> (rice and pork casserole); <em>cocas</em> (topped flatbreads); <em>ensaimada</em> (coiled sweet bread)</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">WINE</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Mallorca’s viticulture dates back to the Romans. Today, thanks to a new breed of vintners who are reviving native grapes, its strong, spicy reds are a delicious surprise. Binissalem, the island’s main DO, produces some excellent reds from local grapes like manto negro and callet, sometimes blended with cabernet sauvignon and tempranillo.</p>

<h3 class="h3a">THE CANARY ISLANDS</h3>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">FAST FACTS</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Just seventy miles from the Moroccan coast and almost a thousand miles from mainland Spain, the exotic Canaries form an archipelago of seven volcanic islands. Searching for an Atlantic base after their discovery of America, Spaniards conquered the Canaries in the fifteenth century, subjugating the indigenous population, the Guanches (a mysterious people whose origins still puzzle scholars). Called the “Fortunate Islands” by the ancient Greeks, today the Canaries derive most of their income from tourists who flock here for the perpetual sunshine, beaches, and stunning volcanic landscapes.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">FOOD</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">A fusion of Iberian, African, and Spanish-Caribbean influences—with a good dose of international tourist cuisine mixed in—Canarian cooking is lush with sub-tropical foodstuffs such as avocadoes, yams, pineapples, papayas, and the ubiquitous local bananas. Potatoes and tomatoes, planted here by Spaniards immediately following the discovery of the New World, also flourish in great profusion in the volcanic soil. Fish is abundant, and many dishes come accompanied by <em>mojos</em>—sprightly salsas made with mortar-pounded aromatics, such as garlic, chiles or herbs.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue"><strong>Traditional Specialties:</strong></span> <em>Gofio</em> (a kind of porridge made with toasted grain); <em>tortilla de platanos</em> (omelet with sliced bananas); <em>potaje de berros</em> (watercress soup); <em>puchero canario</em> (meat and chickpeas stew); <em>sancocho canario</em> (dried fish, potato, and sweet potato stew); <em>papas arrugadas</em> (salt-covered potatoes served with mojo); <em>quesadilla</em> (cheesecake)</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="blue">WINE</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Sweet Malvasia wine from the Canaries was known in Elizabethan England and praised by Voltaire. Despite the difficult climate and soil, the archipelago’s vineyards are once again producing quality wines made from the white malvasia grape, as well as aromatic indigenous red grapes such as negramoll and listán negro.</p>
