<p class="summary"><span class="italic">This creamy white, garlicky sauce is a traditional accompaniment for fish and seafood, grilled meats and poultry, rice, pasta, and potatoes. There are many versions of</span> alioli. <span class="italic">A tiny bit of honey is sometimes added, as are mashed tomatoes and purees of salt cod or of fruits such as quinces, apples, and pears; see the variations that follow.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">The Catalan spelling is</span> allioli. <span class="italic">It means “garlic and oil,” and the original sauce is an emulsion of garlic and oil alone. Garlic is mashed to a paste in a large mortar, then extra virgin olive oil is added drop by drop, and stirred in vigorously with the pestle—always in the same direction—until it becomes a stiff sauce. Unless you are an old hand at it, it is not easy to succeed. All the people I asked in Spain said that these days nearly everyone makes it with egg yolks, like the Provençal aioli, a garlicky mayonnaise. It is easier to make, and most Spaniards have come to prefer a lighter flavor. One chef does not use raw garlic—she roasts or blanches it first so that the flavor is more gentle. The Catalan writer and gastronome Josep Pla famously said that the original</span> alioli <span class="italic">was to the milder garlic mayonnaise what “a lion is to a pet cat.” Now, it seems, even Catalans have come to love cats.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4 TO 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">2 large egg yolks</p>
<p class="qun">3 to 5 garlic cloves</p>
<p class="qun1">1¼ cups oil—about 2:1 parts sunflower and mild extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="recsum">Follow the <span class="italic">mayonesa</span> recipe, but do not add the lemon or vinegar. Add 3 to 5 garlic cloves, depending on the size and how garlicky you want the <span class="italic">alioli</span> to be. Cut the cloves open and remove the green shoots in the middle, then pound and mash them to a paste with a pinch of salt (see page 130). Add the paste to the egg yolks in the bowl and proceed as on page 140.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATIONS</span></p>
<p class="bl-first">• For <span class="italic">alioli</span> made with store-bought mayonnaise, put 1 cup mayonnaise in a bowl and beat in 3 to 4 garlic cloves that have been crushed to a paste and 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil. Add salt if necessary. This makes 1⅓ cups. Be sure to use good-quality mayonnaise for this. It is cheating, but then many Spaniards cheat.</p>
<p class="bl-last">• For Catalan <span class="italic">allioli de mel</span> (with honey), add ½ tablespoon, or to taste, of orange blossom or another aromatic honey.</p>
