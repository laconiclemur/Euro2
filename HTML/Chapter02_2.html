<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span> <small>LIKE TO THINK</small> of the vegetable dishes in this chapter as <i>antipasti</i>, meaning you serve them as a starter before the main course. Or, you can do what my mom did when I was growing up—put a few plates of vegetables on the dinner table with some cheese and pesto, and a loaf of crusty Italian bread, and just go to town. It’s a different way of thinking about dinner. You don’t need the traditional meat, starch, and a vegetable to make a meal—you can do a bunch of small plates, like I suggest throughout this book. Have fun with it and be creative!</p>
<p class="indent">In this chapter, I’ve included recipes for vegetables that span all the seasons of the year. To me, there’s nothing better than going to the farmers’ market and seeing the season’s bounty spread out across the market stalls. Squash and leafy greens in the fall . . . root vegetables in the winter . . . peas and carrots in the spring . . . corn and tomatoes in the summer. Sometimes, it can be sensory overload, but in a good way. A really good way.</p>
<p class="indent">My mom was a vegetarian and I used to complain about that when I was a kid, but I look back on it now and realize how her inventiveness with vegetables throughout the year inspires me today. I love cooking pork, lamb, and other meat, but I also love the challenge of creating a plate of vegetables that doesn’t feel like an afterthought. These vegetable recipes really shine and bolster the goodness that’s inherent in every season’s offerings.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Roasting beets with aromatics enhances their flavor and pulls in the warmth the spices provide. Marcona almonds give this dish a nice, salty crunch, and the citrus peel brightens it all up. This dish would go well with pork, because the flavors will complement each other.</i></p>

<p class="noindent">When you supreme an orange (or a grapefruit), you are removing the peel and the white membrane that encases the segments. This allows you to work with and enjoy the pure pulp and flavor.</p>
<p class="noindentq"><img alt="" src="images/arrow.jpg"/> Using a sharp paring knife or 6-inch chef’s knife, slice off the top and bottom of the orange, exposing the pulp.</p>
<p class="noindentq"><img alt="" src="images/arrow.jpg"/> Starting at the top where the pith meets the pulp, slice down the sides of the orange, following the curve of the fruit, to remove the peel and pith. This will leave you with an orange ball.</p>
<p class="noindentq"><img alt="" src="images/arrow.jpg"/> Cup the orange in your hand and place your knife as close to the white membrane as you can. Slice down toward the core of the orange so that you cut out the orange segments in wedges.</p>
<p class="noindentq"><img alt="" src="images/arrow.jpg"/> Remove each supreme, which should have no membrane at all—just an intact, juicy segment of orange.</p>
