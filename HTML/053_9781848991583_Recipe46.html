<p class="normal"><b>In my view, pineapple is made for a beignet, or fritter, because its fresh, slightly sharp taste has just the right amount of acidity to cut through the rich batter coating. The thin slices of sweet mango go well with the acidity of the pineapple, too, while the piquancy of the pink peppercorns add that unusual finishing touch.</b></p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">SERVES</span></b> 4</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 20 minutes, plus 20 minutes cooling</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b>COOKING</b> 25 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE MANGO CARPACCIO</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">1 large, semiripe mango, peeled, pitted and thinly sliced</p>
<p class="acktxt">¼ cup superfine sugar</p>
<p class="acktxta">2 pinches dried pink peppercorns</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE PINEAPPLE BEIGNETS</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">1 small pineapple, peeled, cored, quartered lengthwise and cut into small chunks about ⅔-inch thick</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 cup all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 eggs, separated</p>
<p class="acktxt">a pinch salt</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup beer, preferably bitter, or dry hard cider</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons sunflower oil, plus extra for deep-frying</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons superfine sugar, plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> To make the carpaccio, put the mango in a deep roasting pan. Put the sugar and ⅔ cup of water into a small saucepan and bring to a boil, swirling the pan occasionally, until the sugar dissolves. Pour the syrup over the mango and scatter with the peppercorns. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and leave to one side to infuse and cool.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Strain the mango syrup back into the washed small pan. Put the mango slices on serving plates and leave to one side. Return the peppercorns to the pan with the syrup and bring to a boil, then boil 5 minutes, or until the syrup is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove the pan from the heat and leave the syrup to cool once more.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> To make the <i>beignets</i>, line a baking sheet with a clean dish towel and spread the pineapple out on it in a single layer. Cover with another dish towel and press down firmly to remove any liquid. Leave to dry, covered, while you prepare the batter. Mix together the flour, egg yolks, salt, beer and oil to make a thick, smooth paste. Beat together the egg whites and sugar in a separate bowl, using an electric mixer, until soft peaks form. Gently fold them into the beer batter.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Meanwhile, pour enough oil to deep-fry the <i>beignets</i> into a deep-fat fryer or a deep, wide saucepan and heat to 325°F, or until a cube of bread browns in 40 seconds.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> Thread a piece of pineapple onto a long skewer and dip briefly into the batter until completely coated. Using a fork, carefully push the pineapple off the skewer into the hot oil. Repeat with the rest of the pineapple, frying about 6 pieces at a time. When the <i>beignets</i> start to float to the surface, carefully turn them over and continue to fry 4 to 5 minutes until they are golden brown and crisp. Remove them with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels, then dust immediately with sugar. Put the <i>beignets</i> on top of the mango carpaccio, then spoon over a little of the cool syrup to serve.</p>
