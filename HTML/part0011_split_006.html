  <p class="chap-para">I love squid and whenever I’m on the coast in Italy, whether at a restaurant or at my sister’s house, I make sure to have them – in a salad, stewed with tomatoes, in pasta, or filled and slow-baked like this. Made this way, they are ideal as a light lunch served with a side salad.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 large squid (calamari), including tentacles</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra to drizzle</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 anchovy fillets</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 tbsp capers</p>

  <p class="ing1">200ml/7fl oz/scant 1 cup white wine</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">100g/3½oz bread, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">40g/1½oz/5 tbsp pine nuts</p>

  <p class="ing1">grated zest of ½ lemon</p>

  <p class="ing2">1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley</p>

  <p class="para">Thoroughly clean the calamari – you can ask your fishmonger to do this – ending up with four perfect sack-like calamari ready to fill. Roughly chop about half of the tentacles and set aside.</p>

  <p class="para">Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas mark 4. Lightly oil a baking dish.</p>

  <p class="para">Heat the olive oil in a saucepan, add the garlic, anchovies and capers and sweat for a few minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon until the anchovies have dissolved. Add the chopped tentacles and stir-fry for about 5 minutes, then add the wine and allow to evaporate; season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove from the heat and leave to cool.</p>

  <p class="para1">Stir in the bread, pine nuts, lemon zest and parsley. Fill each squid with this mixture and tuck the reserved tentacles into the ends, place in the baking dish, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, cover with foil and bake in the oven for 45 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for another 15 minutes, until lightly golden. Serve hot.</p>
