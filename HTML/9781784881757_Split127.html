<h1 class="chapter">peas, bacon &amp; onions</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>Imagine a glass jar of peas in Giancarlo’s mother’s <i>cantina</i> (pantry). The jar is full of summer’s sweetest early young peas preserved in water, salt and a little sugar. On the jar is a handwritten label ‘Piselli, Giugno 1955’. Now imagine a tin of peas from your nearest supermarket. Not quite the same idea? Actually, the contents are more or less the same; don’t diss tinned peas – as a standby vegetable they are sweet and delicious! If fresh peas are in season and you like the therapeutic practise of podding, do use those instead.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 4–6 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 slices of bacon (smoked or unsmoked), cut into 1 cm (½ in) strips</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 small white onion, peeled and finely chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 × 400 g (14 oz) tin petits pois (net weight 265 g/9½ oz) or 250 g (9 oz) fresh peas, boiled until tender</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt and freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Heat the oil in a saucepan over a medium heat. Add the bacon and onion, and sauté until the onion is soft and the bacon is cooked through. Add the tin of peas with half the liquid from the tin (discard the rest), or add the fresh boiled peas with a splash of cooking water. Heat through for around 5 minutes over a medium heat until the peas are hot. Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve straight away, or keep warm until ready to eat.</p>
