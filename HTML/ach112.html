<p class="noindentb">Nonno Tropiano stored the potatoes he grew over the summer in the cold, dry cellar of his house along with the salami he was curing and the wine he was aging. This simple recipe for roasting potatoes with rosemary is very flavorful and has been popular with everyone I have served it to. Serve as a side dish with meat, fish, or chicken.</p>
