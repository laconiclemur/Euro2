<h5 class="h5"><a id="pageid_128"/><b>Pan-fried Cod</b> <span class="smfont">with</span> <b>White Bean Puree</b> <span class="smfont">and</span> <b>Garlic Chips</b></h5>
<p class="normal"><b>This dish is similar to one I make at The Vineyard restaurant and it is always popular. Make sure the cod is super-fresh and line-caught, if possible, but you can use hake or pollock instead. The white bean puree is smooth in contrast to the crisp garlic chips and delicate, tender loins of cod.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt">1 carrot, peeled</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 shallot</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 garlic clove</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves</p>
<p class="acktxta">finely grated zest and juice of 1 lime</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE GARLIC CHIPS</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">sunflower oil, for deep-frying</p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ cup plus 2 tablespooons whole milk</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> To make the white bean puree, put the butter beans in a saucepan, cover with cold water and bring to a boil, skimming off any foam that rises to the surface. Add the carrot, shallot and garlic, turn the heat down to a simmer, partially cover and simmer 40 minutes, or until the beans are tender.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> While the beans are cooking, make the garlic chips. Heat enough sunflower oil to deep-fry the garlic to 315°F, or until a cube of bread browns in 45 seconds. While the oil is heating, bring the milk to a slow boil in a small saucepan. Add the sliced garlic and blanch 2 to 3 minutes until slighly soft but not breaking up. Remove and pat dry with paper towels, discarding the milk. Lightly dust the garlic in the flour, then drop a few slices at a time into the hot oil and deep-fry 2–3 minutes until golden brown and crisp. Drain on paper towels. Season with salt and leave to one side.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Blanch the 8 garlic cloves in a small saucepan of boiling water 4 to 8 minutes until soft, then drain, refresh in cold water and pat dry with paper towels.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Season the skin of the cod with salt and pepper. Melt the butter and olive oil in a large, nonstick skillet with a lid over high heat. When the butter is foaming, add the cod, skin-side down, and cook 3 to 5 minutes until the skin is crisp and golden brown. Turn the heat down to medium-low, add the blanched garlic cloves, partially cover with a lid and cook about 4 minutes. Uncover the pan, carefully turn the fish over and cook 3 to 4 minutes longer until just cooked through.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> Meanwhile, strain the beans, reserving 3 to 4 tablespoons of the cooking liquor, then discard the carrot, shallot and garlic. Transfer the beans to a blender with 3 tablespoons of the reserved cooking liquid and blend to a smooth puree. Add the extra virgin olive oil and blend once more. Add the remaining cooking liquid if the puree is too thick. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then stir in the parsley, half the lime zest and all the lime juice. Serve the cod on a bed of the bean puree with the buttery garlic sauce spooned over the top. Sprinkle with the garlic chips and the remaining lime zest before serving.</p>
