<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">In</span> Don Quixote, <span class="italic">Cervantes tells about Andrés, a fifteen-year-old boy who looks after the sheep of one Juan Haldudo,</span> “el rico” <span class="italic">(the rich man). His master beats him and withholds wages because, as he explains to Don Quixote, sheep keep going missing and he is certain that the boy has sold or eaten them. Don Quixote believes he is innocent and interferes on his behalf, only to make matters worse. Shepherds ate lamb when they spent months away from home with their flocks. They would have had ewe’s milk to cook the meat in, as in this dish. But did they have wine? Perhaps they exchanged cheese for some. I cooked this dish with neck fillet. It become very tender, and the wine, milk, and herbs gave the potatoes a delicious flavor.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4 TO 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">1½ pounds boneless lamb, such as neck fillet or shoulder, trimmed of excess fat, cut into large pieces (about 3½ inches)</p>
<p class="qun">4 garlic cloves, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">1 cup dry white wine</p>
<p class="qun">7 cloves</p>
<p class="qun">2 thyme sprigs</p>
<p class="qun">2 bay leaves</p>
<p class="qun">1 pound medium new potatoes, peeled and cut in half</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon sugar (optional)</p>
<p class="qun1">1 cup whole milk</p>
<p class="recsum">Heat the oil in a wide casserole. Add the meat and brown it lightly on all sides over high heat. Lower the heat, stir in the garlic, and let it just begin to color. Add the wine, cloves, thyme, and bay leaves, then add the potatoes and season with salt and pepper. Simmer, covered, over low heat for about 1 to 1¼ hours, or until the meat is very tender and most of the liquid has been absorbed.</p>
<p class="summary">Add a little sugar if the dryness of the wine needs softening. Stir in the milk, add more salt if necessary, and cook for a few minutes more.</p>
