<p class="normal"><b>This is definitely a salad to try, because it’s both interesting and very different. We used to eat a more traditional version at my aunt’s house and she would send us into the garden to collect the dandelion leaves—called pissenlit in French! We would bring back loads and then prepare them with my uncle. His version of this salad included lardons, but my vegetarian alternative features a crumbly goat cheese and tangy orange to go with the bitterness of the dandelion leaves. It’s a perfect summer dish to serve with a glass of Viognier.</b></p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">SERVES</span></b> 4</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 15 minutes, plus making the croutons</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 3 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon blanched hazelnuts</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 handfuls dandelion leaves, washed thoroughly</p>
<p class="acktxt">5 ounces soft goat cheese log, such as Golden Cross or Ste. Maure, rind removed, crumbled</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 small bunch of chives, cut into 2-inch pieces</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon chopped chervil leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 small oranges</p>
<p class="acktxta">1 tablespoon small Croutons (see <a href="013_9781848991583_Recipe7.html">page 18</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE DRESSING</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon clear honey</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 to 3 tablespoons Chardonnay vinegar or white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> To toast the hazelnuts, put them in a small, dry skillet over medium heat. Toast 2 to 3 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally, until the nuts are light brown all over. Tip them out onto a plate and leave to cool, then lightly crush.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Put the dandelion leaves on four large plates. Scatter the goat cheese over the tops, then add the chives and chervil.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Peel the oranges, removing all the the bitter white pith. Cut it into segments, then cut each segment into 3 pieces, reserving the juice. Scatter the pieces over the salad, then finish with the toasted hazelnuts and croutons.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> To make the dressing, whisk together the honey, reserved orange juice, vinegar and oil in a small bowl until almost opaque, or you can blitz it with a hand-held blender. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then drizzle the dressing over the salad and serve immediately.</p>
