<p class="author1"><span class="txit">spaghetti con pomodoro e tonno</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">The basic tomato sauce for this recipe—excluding the tuna—may be made in advance and kept in the refrigerator for one week or frozen for future use. The tuna should sit in the sauce for ten to fifteen minutes before being ladled over the pasta so the flavor develops. If it sits longer than that, however, the tuna absorbs too much of the tomato and the sauce gets too thick.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup plus</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon coarsely chopped onions</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 cups canned whole plum tomatoes (about one 35-ounce can)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 fresh basil leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">One 6-ounce can Italian tuna packed in olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 pound spaghetti or linguine</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Warm <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup of the olive oil in a small saucepan set over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes, crushing them well with the back of a slotted spoon or by squeezing them through your fingers while adding them to the pan. Season with salt and pepper, and stir in the basil. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer to sweeten the tomatoes, about 20 minutes. Remove the cover and simmer to slightly thicken the sauce, an additional 5 minutes. Drain half of the olive oil from the canned tuna. Pour the remaining oil into the sauce as you use a fork to flake the tuna into the tomato sauce. Cover and simmer to heat through, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_151"/><span class="red">2.</span> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, following the package instructions. Drain, then toss the pasta with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add about 3 ladles of sauce and continue tossing. Distribute evenly among four dinner plates. Ladle the remaining sauce on top, and serve immediately.</p>
