<p class="tx2"><b>Salads are simple in Tuscany, usually consisting of a collection of the freshest vegetables in season from the <i>orto</i> (allotment) or the market. <i>Panzanella</i> is a tomato and cucumber salad with yesterday’s bread soaked in water then crumbled into a salad dressed with vinegar and oil. However, unless you can get hold of Tuscan-style bread, which bounces back after soaking, it just isn’t the same, so we haven’t included it.</b></p>
<p class="tx"><b>Giancarlo loves quartered tomatoes simply dressed with basil, oil and salt. He will eat them with scrambled eggs in the morning to a steak at night. My favourite way to eat tomatoes is in this salad.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 6 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>½ small red onion, peeled and very finely diced</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>5 tablespoons best-quality extra-virgin olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 tablespoon red wine vinegar</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt and freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>600 g (1 lb 5 oz) ripe, flavourful tomatoes (one type or a mixture of heritage, round or cherry)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 sticks celery, finely sliced</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>small handful of celery leaves, roughly chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>handful of parsley leaves, roughly chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>15 medium basil leaves, roughly torn</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>½ long cucumber, peeled and thinly sliced</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Soak the sliced onion in a bowl of cold water for 15 minutes to mellow the flavour. Whisk the oil and vinegar together in a bowl and season lightly with a pinch of salt and black pepper. Cut away and discard the first slice of each tomato where it meets the stem. Cut the remaining flesh into 5 mm- (¼ in-) thick slices. There is no need to do this for cherry tomatoes – simply halve them around the equator rather than pole to pole. Drain the onions well in a sieve.</p>
<p class="tx">Put a layer of tomatoes onto a serving plate and scatter over a spoonful of celery and onions. Season lightly with a pinch of salt and pepper and a scattering of herbs. Pour over a little dressing. Top with a layer of cucumber and repeat with some more onions, herbs and dressing. Repeat until all the ingredients are used up and pour over any leftover dressing. Serve within 1 hour.</p>
