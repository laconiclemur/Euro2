  <h2 class="section sgc-1" id="heading_id_2"><a id="page254"></a>THE SOUFFLES A LA SUISSESSE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">The composition of these soufflés differs from that of an ordinary cheese soufflé only in that the latter would contain one more beaten egg white. The final result, because the <em>suissesses</em> are poached and thoroughly cooked—rather than being rapidly puffed up in a hot oven—and then imbibe a large quantity of heavy cream through a further gratin process, in no way resembles a classic soufflé, but more nearly brings to mind <em>quenelles</em>.</p>

  <p class="indent">Just as artichoke bottoms filled with a classic soufflé mixture and baked in a hot oven provide a light and elegant first course, so will they (first stewed in butter to accentuate their flavor, after having been prepared as indicated on <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#rh2">this page</a>), each “stuffed” with a poached <em>suissesse</em> and finished as indicated, afford a unique gratin.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c16-s58"><em><span class="color">Soufflés à la Suissesse</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Soufflés à la Suissesse</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup milk</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 heaping tablespoons flour (about ⅓ cup)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, freshly ground white pepper, tiny bit of freshly grated nutmeg</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 tablespoons (2 ounces) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 egg yolks</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 egg whites</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1½ cups heavy cream</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Bring the milk to a boil, leave until lukewarm, and pour it slowly into the flour, stirring to avoid lumping. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg and, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, cook over a medium flame until thickened. Leave to cool for several minutes, add 2 tablespoons of butter, something over half of the grated cheese and <a id="page255"></a>the three egg yolks, and mix thoroughly. Beat the egg whites until stiff and fold them in gently but thoroughly.</p>

  <p class="indent">Butter individual molds, porcelain ramekins or muffin tins, spoon them about two-thirds full of the mixture, place them in a larger pan (a cake tin, for instance), and pour in enough hot, but not boiling, water to immerse them by two-thirds. Poach in a slow oven (about 300° F.) for 15 or 20 minutes, or until they are firm and spongy to the touch. Unmold them carefully, so as not to damage them, one by one (or, if they are in muffin tins, all at once) onto a large cookie sheet, first running the blade of a knife around the edges to loosen them. This first cooking process may be carried out in advance, if preferred.</p>

  <p class="indent">Butter a shallow baking or gratin dish of the right size to hold the little soufflés, placed side by side, but not—or barely—touching. Sprinkle the bottom with half the remaining cheese, place the soufflés on top, pour in enough cream to immerse them by half, sprinkle the rest of the cheese over the surface, and bake in a medium oven (about 350° F.) for another 15 or 20 minutes—or until the cream is nearly all absorbed and a light, golden gratin has been formed.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_3">THE SKEWERED LAMBS’ KIDNEYS</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">If rosemary bushes are handy, the branches, sharpened at one end and a tuft of leaves left at the other, not only afford a much prettier presentation than the usual metal skewers but lend their delicate perfume to the meats. Lamb hearts or lean pieces of meat may be mixed with the kidneys, and small tomatoes, slices of small zucchini, small mushrooms, etc., represent alternate vegetable possibilities. The strung skewers may, for variation, be rolled in <em>duxelles</em> before being grilled. (This is more often done with calf’s liver, the pieces of which are first sautéed just long enough to become slightly firm.) When using <em>duxelles</em>, it is more successfully done beneath a broiler than over hot coals, as the <em>duxelles</em> that refuses to cling to the skewers is then recovered to be used as a garnish instead of being lost in the coals.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c16-s59"><a id="page256"></a><em><span class="color">Skewered Lambs’ Kidneys</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Brochettes de Rognons d’Agneau</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>8 lambs’ kidneys</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 medium-sized sweet onions (Spanish or white) or 12 small fresh white garden onions</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 sweet peppers</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>6 bay leaves, preferably fresh, each cut in 2</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>few pinches <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#page86">Mixed Herbs</a></em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about ⅓ cup olive oil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 cloves garlic, crushed and peeled</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup bread crumbs</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, pepper</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Remove the fat and the thin surface membrane from the kidneys and cut each into 3 pieces, spokewise, from the point of attachment. If the onions are tiny, leave them whole; otherwise, cut them into quarters, vertically, and separate the sections. Remove all the seeds from the peppers and cut them into pieces approximately 1½ inches square. Combine the kidneys, vegetables, and pieces of bay leaf in a bowl, sprinkle with a couple of pinches of mixed herbs and the olive oil and toss together. Leave to marinate for an hour or so, tossing or turning from time to time.</p>

  <p class="indent">Reduce the garlic to a purée in a mortar, add the bread crumbs and mix well until they are sticky and permeated with garlic.</p>

  <p class="indent">Alternate 6 pieces of kidney on each skewer with the peppers and onions, season, and roll the skewers in the garlic crumbs, pressing lightly to ensure their being well coated. Grill them, preferably over hot coals on a preheated heavy welded-iron grill, turning them 4 times, about every 1½ or 2 minutes, depending on the intensity of the heat, and basting them regularly but lightly with the remaining marinade, until all sides are evenly browned. To be tender, moist and flavorful, the kidneys must remain pink inside. Arrange them on a bed of rice which has been turned out onto a heated serving platter.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c16-s60"><a id="page257"></a><em><span class="color">Saffron Rice with Tomatoes</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Riz Safrané aux Tomates</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 medium onion, finely chopped</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ pound (1 stick) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup long-grained rice</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>a pinch</em> (<em>something less than ¼ teaspoon) saffron</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 cups boiling water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 1-pound can whole tomatoes (in season, 3 or 4 medium-size tomatoes, peeled and seeded)</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Use an earthenware or heavy copper utensil with a tight-fitting lid. Cook the chopped onion gently in 1 tablespoon butter for about 10 minutes, until soft and yellowed but not browned. Add the rice, saffron and salt, stirring from time to time with a wooden spoon, and after a couple of minutes, when the grains have acquired a “milky” tint, pour in the boiling water, stir once, and leave, covered, over a tiny flame so that the barest possible movement may be detected at the water’s surface. Remove from the heat after about 20 minutes (some rices require more or less cooking time), and leave to swell and dry out for 5 to 10 minutes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Meanwhile, drain the tomatoes, cut them in half to remove seeds and liquid, and stew them gently in 2 tablespoons of butter for a few minutes. Just before serving, mix into the rice the tomatoes and the remaining butter, cut into small pieces, delicately and repeatedly lifting the rice with the prongs of a fork so as to loosen the grains from one another without damaging them. Grated cheese may also be added at this time, if desired.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_4"><a id="page258"></a>CREPES A LA NORMANDE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Good cooking apples are, the world over, becoming increasingly difficult to find. Russets are the best (in France, a small and unsightly variety known as <em>clocharde</em> is a perfect cooking apple), but the mediocre “golden delicious,” because of its tremendous productivity, is replacing them on the market, and one is often obliged to use it.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c16-s61"><em><span class="color">Crêpes à la Normande</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Crêpes à la Normande</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>12 Crêpes, prepared as on <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#page83">this page</a>, but substituting Calvados (apple-jack) for the cognac</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 apples, halved, peeled, cored and sliced thin</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 tablespoons (2 ounces) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about ½ cup sugar</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Make crêpes. Stew sliced apples in butter over a low flame, tossing them from time to time, until just cooked but firmly retaining their shape. Roll about a tablespoonful, first sprinkled with a bit of sugar, into each crêpe, arrange the crêpes in a buttered shallow baking dish, sprinkle the surface lightly with sugar, and put into a hot oven for a few minutes—just long enough to heat them thoroughly and to melt and lightly glaze the sugar on the surface.</p>
