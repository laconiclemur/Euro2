  <p class="h1"><a id="page_161"/>Parties</p>

  <p class="noindent">Giving a party can be an exhilarating experience if properly planned. Success is guaranteed if sufficient time is allowed for preparation and a few simple rules are followed.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Why give a party?</span> We do not need an excuse for a party. Life is a celebration! So call your family or friends together and share your joy of living. And if you are Norwegian we have many feast days through the year (see my book, <span class="italic">Norway’s Fest Days</span>) with themes just waiting for us to be enjoyed.</p>

  <p class="indent">As a young girl in Norway, I learned much about party-giving from my mother. She radiated happiness when she made her party preparations. She had fun both planning and preparing, knowing the enjoyment everyone, including herself, would have. She did not have much money in her budget, but she utilized her imagination and talents. And she left a trail of happy guests after each get-together. If you have a new idea on how to give a great party, use it. Our world would come to a standstill and be unbearably boring without our imaginations!</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Make a list:</span> Include on your list everything that needs to be done then follow it. Invitations, decorations, food shopping, house cleaning, and the like must be taken into consideration. Plan your invitations, decorations, and menu around the chosen theme. The menu does not have to be elaborate but do make it tasty and colorful. The food will have a lot to do with your party’s success. Any food that can be prepared and frozen is to your advantage.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Decide on your guest list:</span> You will succeed with the right planning and by inviting the right people. At your own party you can invite whomever you please. We give parties for many reasons—one of them should not be to invite people we feel “obligated” to. Your party should be to honor someone, to celebrate a special occasion, or just to give your friends and family a memorable time. Invite only those whom you feel will socialize well with others, and whom you know will help others to enjoy themselves. That does not mean that everyone should have the same interests and professions, but it does mean people who enjoy people, people who enjoy learning about others, and people who enjoy life. People who not only enjoy themselves but who will just be themselves, help others to have a great time as well.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/161-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="italic">There is no party without candles. Today they come in every conceivable color and shape. You will have no problem finding the appropriate candles to complement your decor.</span></p>

  <p class="indent1">Make or buy special invitations. Mail out no more than three weeks in advance. Include a telephone number for “regrets only.” For most of us today, a telephone call will do, but do allow your guests plenty of advance notice.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Remember the flowers:</span> If the occasion calls for special flowers, order in advance. Let the florist know you will pick them up as soon as the store opens; that way they will be ready for you. If it is a winter party, do not unwrap the flowers immediately upon arriving home. Remove some of the paper around the stems and place in water. This will get the blossoms accustomed to the temperature change and they will last longer.</p>

  <p class="indent">Purchased flowers can be expensive. Hopefully in the summer time, you have a few growing in your own garden, in window boxes, or on the patio. If not, look around for wild flowers or greenery; they make beautiful decorations.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Put your house in order:</span> Clean and vacuum the whole house, and polish the furniture. Wash and polish all tableware and dishes, and iron table linen or place mats. The night before the party make another list reminding yourself of last-minute chores <a id="page_162"/>and check them off as you progress, thus assuring yourself that nothing is left undone.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">The morning of your party:</span> Food meant to be served fresh, such as relish, salad, and fruit should be purchased the morning of the party. Early in the morning the stores are not crowded, and the produce is fresh. Select what you need, pick up your flowers, and you will be home in no time.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Set your table:</span> A beautifully dressed table will add immensely to the spirit of your party. Take time to make it beautiful. Your sparkling-clean tableware, the polished silver, the beautiful flowers you picked up, and candles will add that special touch.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">The size of the party:</span> The size of the party will determine whether or not it will be necessary to serve guests buffet-style. If possible, have enough card tables or other small tables set up so that your guests will be comfortable while dining. It would be helpful if the tables are set with needed tableware, glasses, and cups. After the guests have served themselves and are seated you can pour the beverage. The secret of a successful buffet is that it looks tempting and tastes delicious. Utilize candles, flowers, or special decorations. Place the meat, fish, vegetables, salad, relishes, fruits, and breads in groups. Make sure that each dish has its own serving utensil.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">The guests arrive:</span> When on the day of your party, your home, table, and food are prepared or food is cooking in the oven, then it is time for you to spruce up. You need to be at your best and sparkle with enthusiasm. A droopy host or hostess has the same negative reaction on guests as droopy flowers. When you are ready, light the fire—if it is the season—start the background music, and light the candles strategically placed around your home.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Festive Occasions:</span> The festive occasions of yesteryear were notable, I believe, not because they were extravagant but because they were something out of the ordinary. Today, our lives are quite affluent compared with our parents’ times. Yet, those things we can purchase for a party without giving much thought to the expense does not necessarily make it a memorable occasion. Often it is the thoughtful, simple, and unique things we do for others that make these memorable happenings.</p>

  <p class="indent">An example of this was my ninth birthday, during World War II. Unbeknown to me, mamma had traded some of her beautiful hand-embroidered work to secure red fruit jello, and some other special foods for that day. We had no refrigeration, but it was February and plenty cold. She placed the jello outside on the veranda to set. I tingled throughout when I rubbed the morning frost off our kitchen window and discovered the bowl of jello. The hours stretched before evening when it could be enjoyed with family and friends. I remember nothing else about that birthday but that gloriously red jello and the sacrifice made to make me a little girl happy during very difficult times. Make your special occasions memorable by your thoughtful and imaginative deeds.</p>

  <p class="cap1"><span class="italic">Do not hesitate to try something new and different just because it has never been done before. Use your talents—and your imagination. You can, of course, glean ideas from others, but a party is your coming out where you can plan and create for the enjoyment of others. Most people love parties. That is, everyone enjoys a party where the host and hostess have given some thought to the preparation of the party—the theme, food, decorations, timing, and whom to invite.</span></p>

  <p class="cap1"><span class="italic">When the doorbell rings, swing open your door and share with those lucky invited ones the best that you are, the warmth of your home, your scrumptious food, and the excitement of mingling with friends or meeting new ones. Above all let them enjoy a relaxed, happy host and hostess who have learned the art of making others happy.</span></p>

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_163"/>Table Setting with Norwegian Charm</p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="italic">I believe most Norwegians, like me, are instilled with the idea that making their surroundings beautiful is an important and rewarding task. When it comes to table settings, most pride themselves in setting a colorful, beautifully coordinated table. Everything used for setting the table should be the best affordable. Since Norway abounds in many talented craftsmen and artists, who incidentally are second to none in the world, the homemaker may choose from a variety of styles in dishes, glassware, and silverware.</span></p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/163-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent">It is an indisputable fact that food prepared with care and consideration, and served in beautiful surroundings, brings indescribable pleasure and instills nostalgia for years to come.</p>

  <p class="indent">One of my most memorable supper evenings was spent dining in a living room in front of a cozy fireplace. The hostess had cleverly covered card tables with floor-length, self-made tablecloths, and graced each table with a bud vase containing sweetheart roses. Each place setting had a small candle. With the crackling fire spreading its warmth throughout the room, a background of soft dinner music, and glowing candles, the simple but thoughtfully prepared meal tasted remarkably delicious.</p>

  <p class="indent">Yet another occasion was breakfast in a mountain cottage. The table was set with a crisp colorful tablecloth and newly-picked wild flowers for a centerpiece. It was not expensive and took only a little thought and caring on the part of the hostess—but it has stayed with me to this day.</p>

  <p class="indent">Norwegians are very conscious of their surroundings and at no time are they more aware of them than mealtime. As far back as I can remember, special celebrations in our home always held foremost the anticipation of what was to come. Not just the preparation of the food but the beautiful and imaginative decorations we watched mama make.</p>

  <p class="indent">The tablecloth, be it lace, linen, the colorful permanent pressed ones, or an exquisitely hand-embroidered beauty, tops the homemaker’s “wish” list. China, crystal, and silver is chosen with care and used with love and pride. Whatever the occasion or the season, whatever the reason for a festive celebration, the Norwegian homemaker is always happy to display her talents in an exceptional table setting. To set an attractive table takes only a genuine desire to make the surroundings more pleasant and beautiful for the ones you love and associate with.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Centerpieces:</span> There are many ways to make a memorable centerpiece. Place the flower arrangement on a mirror base, and add crystal or silver candlesticks on either side. Or place two or three flowering plants down the center of the table, interspersed with complimentary or contrasting color candles.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Winter scene:</span> A winter scene can also be created with a mirror as a base, fluffy cotton around the edges, a few skating figurines, a little tree and a bench on the side, and floating candles in glass or crystal containers.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Shellfish dinner:</span> For a shellfish dinner use a burlap tablecloth. Heavy pewter plates, or pottery, and mugs would be great for such a party. No beautiful crystal and porcelain here. Place a container with sand, in a low, oblong wooded box, down the center of the table. In the sand, wrap and bury special little favors. Around the sand place pretty shells, some small drift wood pieces, and floating-type candles <a id="page_164"/>fastened into halved and covered with enough sand so only the candle will show. When dinner is through pass out tiny toy spades or spoons to each guest so they may dig for their special “treasure” you have buried for them. I promise you this center piece will start a lively conversation.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Fruit:</span> Fruit always makes a beautiful centerpiece, if used as part of the dessert. Wash and polish the fruit. Tuck fruit knives strategically around the fruit that has been arranged in a beautiful bowl. Remember color combinations and different textures of fruit.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">A splendid cake:</span> Another elegant, as well as popular, Norwegian centerpiece is <span class="italic">kransekake</span> that has been decorated for the occasion. This, too, may serve a dual purpose—as centerpiece and dessert. When serving, in order to preserve the original shape and beauty of the <span class="italic">kransekake</span>, begin by removing the bottom ring first and cutting it into suitable portions. Progress upward, until the rings become small enough to be served whole.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Setting the table:</span> It seems so simple to set a table. I am not one for formalities and rules, though I like things to be gracious. I believe you make people happy when you care about them and try to make pleasant surroundings. Yet, over the years I have been in places were the hosts have been uneasy, not being quite sure if they are “doing it right.” It is for you that I am adding these suggestions, hoping they might help you to feel more comfortable in preparing your table for a feast.</p>

  <p class="indent">There are many ways of setting a table but certain basic rules that are familiar to most insure a pretty table. Make sure the tablecloth overhang is even on all sides—12 inches is about right.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Place setting:</span> Place settings should be arranged immediately opposite each other and the same distance from the table edge. Tableware needs to differ depending on the occasion, and we can add or take away accordingly. Place forks on the left side of plate with the dinner fork next to the plate, then the salad fork. Place knives on the right side with the meat knife next to plate, then the fish knife (if needed), and then the soup spoon. In other words, arrange in the order needed to eat. In Norway, the dessert spoon is placed above the plate with the handle facing right; the dessert fork likewise, with the handle facing left. A coffee or teaspoon is usually placed on the saucer. All stemware is centered above the plate, and to assure ease in serving, place the tallest glass to the left. The cup is placed on the right of the stemware and the salad plate to the left. Some meals require a finger bowl that is brought in at the end of the meal, filled three-fourth full with warm water and a lemon wedge on the edge of the bowl.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Napkins:</span> For a more formal party, fabric napkins are perhaps desirable, but in today’s shops we find such a variety of quality paper napkins that you must use your judgement to fit the particular occasion. Napkins will add yet another dash to the table if they contrast in color from the tablecloth. They can be folded in many different and interesting shapes. A crowded table is neither relaxing nor pretty.</p>

  <p class="indent">In days past, it was fashionable to fold the napkins in various shapes to add a festive air to the table. Today we try to simplify our busy lives. However, from time to time it is fun to add a little extra touch. For honored guests, such as a bride and groom, Norwegians fold their napkins differently from the rest.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Serving:</span> All food should be served from your guests’ left side, and any plates or dishes should be removed from their right. Make certain that the same guests are not always served last. When soup is served, if it is supposed to be hot, be sure that it is piping hot. If it is to be cold, be sure it is thoroughly chilled. Soup should be served from the guest’s right side. For self-service from a tray, it should be offered from the left. Serving pieces should be placed on a platter or bowl as to eliminate the need for reaching. Throughout the meal the host or hostess should be conscious that his or her guests are well supplied with a beverage at all times. When you are ready to serve dessert, remove all dishes from the table—everything except glasses and cups if needed.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Flowers:</span> Yes! You can say it with flowers. Their beautiful vivid colors when combined and properly arranged will add beauty to any table, not only with <a id="page_165"/>color but with distinction as well. But use them properly.</p>

  <p class="indent">For example, roses would clash with a crab feast and daisies would not exactly compliment a formal table setting. Keep your flower arrangements low by utilizing flat bowls or small vases. It is frustrating to try and have a conversation across the table through peep holes in the foliage and flowers. Make the flower arrangement the proper size for the table.</p>

  <p class="indent">Often during the freezing, dark, and dismal winter months in Norway, flowering potted plants or fresh cut flowers grace tables and windowsills. Having been brought up in a home were flowers were as important a purchase on Friday as were the weekly groceries, I find flowers still an important part of my decorating scheme. Contrary to what many believe, they need not be expensive. It is not necessary to buy a prearranged centerpiece. Get the fresh cut flowers and arrange them yourself—you do not need a dozen of each; just five, seven, or nine flowers, depending on the occasion or type of flowers purchased. The florist will add a touch of green, or you possibly have all kinds of greenery growing in your own yard. Plant bulbs in pots each fall and they will bloom on your window sill in the middle of the winter. In the summer you need only a few square feet of soil to plant some seeds that will yield flowers all summer long. It takes such little effort and brings an abundance of delight in return.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/165-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Candles:</span> Candles are available today in every conceivable color, size, and shape: the type that floats on water; thin tapered ones that incorporate well with floral arrangements; tall slender ones for formal gatherings; short, squatty ones; and more. And you do not just need to use one candle on each side of the flower arrangement. Use a mirror as a base and group several of one color or in different colors and shapes. It is dazzling.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="red">Family Meals (Familie m</span><span class="red">å</span><span class="red">ltider)</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Everyday family meals are the most meaningful because they are spent with the most important people in the world to you—your family. There are numerous ways to make the table more attractive for family mealtimes. First, be sure that the dishes and silverware are sparkling clean. Spread the table with a spotless, colorful tablecloth, or use place mats. For goodness sake, place mats are so unlimited (watch for sales) today, there is no reason one cannot have a variety of them. The plastic ones are excellent for families with small children. Place a few flowers or a bowl of fruit in the center of the table, or some favorite figurines, greens, leaves, or cones. Or make a special center piece for special days. Use candles often (yes, of course for your family!). They too enjoy beauty, and candles have such a soothing, quieting effect. You can make mealtime even more pleasant by folding the napkins in unusual ways.</p>

  <p class="indent">I cannot resist telling you about another Norwegian person who was a great inspiration to me. Many years ago in Vermont, while I was serving with “Ski for Light” as a guide for the blind, I met Hjalmar Jensen, then seventy-eight years young. He was also a guide, accompanying the blind skiers from Norway. On my visit to Norway the following summer I had a lunch date with Hjalmar in downtown Oslo. He was rather distraught, saying his wife, also named Astrid, had been quite ill. And having suffered three heart attacks, he was quite concerned she would not make it this time. Her body was not <a id="page_166"/>producing marrow or its own blood. She was down to 80 pounds and had shrunk 5 ½ inches (14 cm). “But,” he said, “if you could take the time, even a few minutes, to come and meet her, it would mean a lot.” I told him I must and cancelled my next appointment. Within 20 minutes the train had brought us to Nordstrand, a suburb of Oslo, then another 10 minute walk and we reached their home.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Darling we are home,” Hjalmar called, as he unlocked their front door. I was ill prepared for the greeting I received. A tiny figure nearly floated from the living room into the hallway. Stylishly dressed in a two-piece outfit, Astrid was wearing a vest that minimized how frail she was. A string of pearls around her neck, beautiful well cared for silver gray hair, and a smile so warm and beautiful it would, I am convinced, brighten any gloomy day. She threw her arms out and gave me a hug. I had to double over to reach her cheek to cheek.</p>

  <p class="indent">Astrid was aglow with enthusiasm and gratitude for life. On my short visit I learned many things from this remarkable seventy-seven-year-old woman. And why am I telling you this? Because Astrid learned how to live and make others happy. The home she had created by her sweet spirit and actions truly was heaven on earth. Seven years earlier she had been hit by a street car and had spent several months in the hospital. Her right arm was totally useless yet she received joy from making bread and goodies for her husband, family, and friends. And Hjalmar confided that it was Astrid that kept their home sparkling clean.</p>

  <p class="indent">With pride she led me into her immaculate kitchen. On their small kitchen table was a hand embroidered table cloth and fresh flowers. “It is all so beautiful!” I exclaimed. She squeezed my hand. “We believe in making it nice for each other,” she confided. “We always use a tablecloth, fresh flowers, and candles on the table when we share a meal.” Her spirit warmed my heart. Let us follow her example and love, and make our homes and meals a daily celebration for our families.</p>

  <p class="h3">Hot Chocolate (Sjokolade)</p>

  <p class="noindent">When I was growing up in Norway, a cup of hot chocolate was a treat reserved for special occasions like birthdays, celebrations, and Christmas. It seems when my mother fixed chocolate she always used the same saucepan. I can still see it in my mind’s eye today. She kept the large heavy aluminum pot made by Høyang sparkling. She would stay close by the wood stove and stir as the chocolate was brought to a boil, and I presume all of us children must have been close by since it is still so vivid in my mind. The best part was the dab of whipped cream (no, not Cool Whip) added to the chocolate just before serving. To us children, it was pure bliss. Yes, you can make Nestle’s Quick in a jiffy. But for Christmas, treat the children and yourself to hot chocolate the traditional Norwegian way.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/166-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">¼ cup cocoa</p>

  <p class="ing">4 cups water</p>

  <p class="ing">6 oz. Freia cooking chocolate (available at Scandinavian delicatessens)</p>

  <p class="ing">4 cups whole milk</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ½ cups whipping cream</p>

  <p class="ing">3–4 tsp. vanilla sugar or pure vanilla extract</p>

  <p class="ingl">½ cup sugar, scant</p>

  <p class="noindent1">To a large heavy bottomed saucepan, add cocoa, chocolate, sugar, and water and bring to a boil under vigorous beating. Add the milk and bring chocolate to the boiling point, stirring constantly but do not let it boil. If needed add more sugar. Whip the cream until firm and add vanilla sugar. Pour chocolate into cups and add whipping cream on top just before serving.</p>

  <p class="h1"><a id="page_167"/>Napkin Folding</p>

  <p class="h3">Palm Leaf (Palmeblad)</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/167-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent">Fold the napkin in two. Fold the top corners <span class="small">C</span> and <span class="small">D</span> down and in toward the center. Fold the underneath half in double downward. Turn the napkin and fold the corners <span class="small">A</span> and <span class="small">B</span> diagonally upwards. Pleat the whole napkin crosswise. Begin with the center and make equal size folds out to both sides. Fold the lower part of the pleats a little outward on both sides resembling a leaf. Stand by the plate or in a glass. See illustration.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/167-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h3">Lily (Lilje)</p>

  <p class="noindent">Fold the napkin doubled cornered—in between to make a triangle. Fold the corners <span class="small">A</span> and <span class="small">B</span> up to <span class="small">B</span> and <span class="small">C</span>. Turn the napkin and fold up the corner <span class="small">X</span>. Fold the corners <span class="small">F</span> and <span class="small">G</span> inside each other so that corner <span class="small">X</span> turns in. Slightly fold the corners <span class="small">A</span> and <span class="small">D</span> down, making one lily.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="blue">Variation:</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Fold corner <span class="small">X</span> to make a triple pleat. Follow the remainder of the directions as explained above.</p>

  <p class="h3">Iris (Iris)</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/167-3.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent">Fold the napkin corner—in between to form a triangle. Fold the corners <span class="small">A</span> and <span class="small">D</span> up to <span class="small">B</span> and <span class="small">C</span>. Fold corner <span class="small">X</span> in; fold as shown in the drawing. Fold corners <span class="small">F</span> and <span class="small">G</span> inside each other. Fold corners <span class="small">A</span> and <span class="small">D</span> down and underneath the fold. Fold corner <span class="small">C</span> slightly outward and down.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="red">Fan (Vifte)</span></p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/167-4.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent">Fold the napkin in two. Fold side <span class="small">AB</span> up, approximately 1 ¼–1 ½ inches (3–4 cm) from the double fold. Turn the napkin and fold the other side up in the same manner. Pleat the whole napkin across and press the folds tightly together. Carefully pull out both outer edges. Fold carefully out and down all the “in-folds” both on the outside and on the top (see illustration). Display the napkin to form a fan.</p>

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_168"/>Candle (Lys)</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/168-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent">Place the napkin double corner in between, making a triangle. Fold one corner up along the long side of the triangle. Roll the triangle into a tight roll, so that the corner that was folded up is now on the outside of the roll. Fasten the tip in the fold to help hold the roll in place. Fold one of the top tips slightly outward.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="red">Slipper (Tøffel)</span></p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/168-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent">Fold the napkin in fourths. Fold corner <span class="small">X</span> up to the opposite corner, forming a triangle. Turn the napkin so that the corners <span class="small">ABCD</span> face upwards. Fold the corners <span class="small">F</span> and <span class="small">G</span> downward meeting in the center below the fold. Fold them down and up on the other side of the napkin, and fold the napkin double up over the folded corners, forming the slipper. Carefully pull up the folded corners.</p>

  <p class="h3">Viking Ship (Vikingskip)</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/168-3.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent">Make your own Viking ship to serve crackers, cookies, nuts, and other treats in.</p>

  <p class="noindent">The napkins must be heavily starched. Place the napkin flat on the table. Place a piece of waxpaper on top, the same size as the napkin. With the paper inside, fold the napkin in two, forming a triangle. Fold the corners <span class="small">A</span> and <span class="small">D</span> toward each other and double the napkin once more. Place the napkin in a towel that has been folded, with the whole fold turned inward. Place the towel with the napkin inside underneath a cutting board. Press down hard with your left hand, and with a jerk pull the tip of the towel where the napkin lies, with your right hand, making it wrinkled.</p>

  <p class="indent">Repeat with a second napkin. Fasten a thin steel thread on the inside, in the tip of the napkin, enabling the tip to point upwards. Place the two napkins together and cover the connection with another napkin if necessary.</p>
