  <p class="chap-para">This dish was once typical of street food in Naples, and I have given its name in Neapolitan dialect. It is still eaten as street food but is not as common as it used to be. It is considered to be a winter dish, served with lots of black pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice, and often used as a cold remedy. You can enjoy the broth as a starter and serve the octopus as a main course <a href="part0009_split_011.html#ch3sec11a" class="calibre1">salad</a>. You will need to order the octopus from your fishmonger.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 whole octopus, weighing about 1.2kg/2lb 10oz</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 tsp salt</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 bay leaves</p>

  <p class="ing1">15 black peppercorns</p>

  <p class="ing1">freshly ground black pepper, to serve</p>

  <p class="ing2">freshly squeezed lemon juice, to serve (optional)</p>

  <p class="para">Rinse the octopus under cold running water and set aside.</p>

  <p class="para">Put 1.5 litres/2½ pints/1½ quarts water, the salt, bay leaves and peppercorns into a large saucepan and bring to the boil. Hold the octopus by its head and dip it into the hot water several times – this is done to curl the tentacles. Put the octopus in the boiling water, cover with a lid and simmer on a medium–low heat for about 1¼ hours, until tender.</p>

  <p class="para1">Carefully remove the octopus and set aside on a plate, together with a little of the broth; use to make <a href="part0009_split_011.html#ch3sec11a" class="calibre1">Octopus salad</a>. Serve the broth in cups or bowls with lots of freshly ground black pepper and a drizzle of lemon juice, if desired.</p>
