  <h2 class="section sgc-1" id="heading_id_2"><a id="page322"></a>THE POT-AU-FEU</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">“In France, the <em>pot-au-feu</em> is the symbol of family life.… A good <em>pot-au-feu</em> will always be a comfortable and thoroughly bourgeois dish which nothing may dethrone.”—Escoffier: <em>Ma Cuisine</em></p>

  <p class="indent">If any single preparation merits being termed the French national dish, it is <em>pot-au-feu</em>. Technically the word means nothing more than “stewpot” and was originally the pot of soup kept at the back of the stove from one end of the year to the other, regularly supplemented by bones, vegetables, water, meats, etc., to provide a family’s daily sustenance. A handsome piece of meat, if the family could afford it, was added on Sundays.</p>

  <p class="indent">It has long since come to mean boiled beef (“poached” would be more accurate) and vegetables, and there are regional variations: in Provence, mutton is added, elsewhere a hen, often stuffed with rice, may be thrown in (it may then be called <em>petite marmite</em>), and veal sometimes lends a more gelatinous quality to the broth). No soup is more succulent than the amber broth, unclarified and imperfectly degreased and poured over dried bread crusts, from a beef <em>pot-au-feu</em>.</p>

  <p class="indent"><em>Pot-au-feu</em> is a meal in itself, and unless it has been prepared specifically with the notion of using the bouillon for another preparation (in which case, the meats and vegetables may be preceded by a simple hors d’oeuvre, but should in any case be accompanied by enough bouillon to moisten them), it would be an error to attempt to correlate it with other dishes.</p>

  <p class="indent">A perfect bouillon depends, among other things, on the meat’s being started in cold water (as low in calcium content as possible—if your tap water is very hard, it is well worth while collecting rainwater or using clean-tasting, bottled mineral water). But the meats, to guard their succulence, should be plunged directly into boiling liquid. Logically, then, a perfect <em>pot-au-feu</em> must really be two: the first, begun cold, produces the basic broth; the second, moistened with the boiling broth, permits the meats to retain their maximum qualities.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cabbage greatly enriches the garnish and, in itself, is never better than when braised in the fat bouillon skimmed from a <em>pot-au-feu</em>. B<a id="page323"></a>ecause of its distinctive flavor, it should always be cooked separately so as not to destroy the delicacy of the soup (the cabbage’s leftover cooking liquid moistens to perfection a partridge braised with cabbage—see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c05_r1.htm#rh16">this page</a>). In the past, a parsnip (<em>panais</em>—a vegetable practically unknown in France today) always lent its unique, sweet flavor to the bouillon of a <em>pot-au-feu</em>.</p>

  <p class="indent">Oxtail is an economical cut and lends a fine rich quality to the bouillon. None of the other cuts recommended are irreplaceable, but at least one must be gelatinous (in this instance, the heel—those cuts, known in French as <em>macreuse</em> and <em>paleron</em>, both from the chuck section, are also excellent gelatinous cuts) and another interlarded.</p>

  <p class="indent">Leftover <em>pot-au-feu</em> meats lose their firmness and savor if allowed to stand in the bouillon. If they are to be used in other preparations, they should be drained and stored separately, covered with a plate. Possibilities for using leftover boiled beef are endless. Simply sliced and served cold, sprinkled with coarse salt, it is delicious—or prepared <em>à la vinaigrette</em> as a first course. Perhaps the commonest of the hot preparations is <em>miroton</em>: Sautéed onions are sprinkled with flour, moistened with bouillon and vinegar—a couple of tablespoonfuls of the latter for 1½ cups of bouillon—and simmered for 15 minutes with a pinch of herbs; they are then poured over the slices of beef, which have first been arranged in a gratin dish and sprinkled with capers and sliced sour gherkins. The surface is sprinkled with bread crumbs, dotted with butter and gratinéed in a gentle oven.</p>

  <p class="indent">An earthenware <em>pot-au-feu</em> or <em>marmite</em> or one of enameled cast iron are perfect cooking vessels. Lacking either, use the largest pot of any kind available—12 to 15 quarts. Leave out any ingredients you can’t get, but do not forgo trying a <em>pot-au-feu</em>.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE PRELIMINARY BOUILLON</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">It is practical, but not necessary, to prepare this bouillon the preeeding day.</p>

  <p class="indent">The vegetables should be peeled but left whole, the green parts of the leeks slit and washed thoroughly while still attached to the whites, the parsley roots scraped, and the dried mushrooms put to soak in a bowl of cold water.</p>

  <p class="indent">Place the oxtail in the bottom of the <em>pot-au-feu</em> pot, pour water over, and bring to a boil over a medium flame (if earthenware is used, it should be protected by an asbestos pad; the flame may be turned high because of the slowness with which the pad absorbs the heat). As the boil approaches, begin to skim off the rising gray scum, <a id="page325"></a>add a glass of cold water, and continue skimming as more rises to the surface. Repeat this procedure several times, adding some cold water each time the liquid arrives at a pronounced boil.</p>

  <p class="indent">Drain the mushrooms, rinse them well, pare any stem tips to which sand or earth still cling, and add them, along with all the other ingredients, to the pot. As the boil approaches again, skim once more and, over a period of 10 to 15 minutes, regulate the heat until assured that a bare simmer will be steadily maintained, the liquid’s surface hardly murmuring, with the lid kept slightly ajar (on the cast-iron surface of an old-fashioned stove or with the gas-flame-heated cast-iron plaques of semiprofessional stoves, the heat regulation is both simpler and more precise). Leave undisturbed for from 3 to 5 hours; if the oxtail is intended to serve in another preparation—simmered in tomato sauce and accompanied by pasta, for instance, or <em>à la provençale</em>, with black olives, garlic, sautéed eggplant and sweet peppers added to the tomato sauce—it should be removed after 3 hours; if not, it will continue for another couple of hours to lend its qualities to the broth. Pass the broth through a sieve to remove all solid ingredients (don’t discard the head of garlic—the purée, squeezed from the hulls and mixed with a bit of olive oil is a delicious snack when spread on crusty bread or toast).</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE POT-AU-FEU</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Skim off any excess fat from the bouillon, bring it back to a boil in the <em>marmite</em> or other pot (which has meanwhile been cleaned—if it is earthenware, the bulk of the bouillon may first be brought to a boil in another vessel to save time), taste for salt, add the tied-up meats and, if necessary, just enough boiling water to ensure their being largely covered. Skim again, 2 or 3 times, as before, and regulate the heat again to maintain a bare simmer, the lid kept slightly ajar.</p>

  <p class="indent">Remove the tough, dark-green outer leaves from the cabbages, cut each vertically into quarters, pare the visible thick leaf ribs and the core, leaving just enough to hold the quarters together, and wash them. Fit them snugly, so that they will retain their form, into a large saucepan, immerse them in salted boiling water and parboil, covered and at a simmer, for from 12 to 15 minutes (even tender, young cabbages should first be parboiled to make them more digestible, to attenuate <a id="page326"></a>their aggressive flavor and to rid them of excess water, which, in the braising process, would dilute the rich flavor of the braising liquid). Drain them, pressing gently to force out excess liquid, and, 1½ hours after the meats have been put to cook, replace the parboiled cabbage quarters in their saucepan, skim several ladles of bouillon from the surface of the <em>pot-au-feu</em>, taking as much of the fat with the bouillon as possible, pour it over the cabbages (just enough to completely immerse them), and put them to simmer, covered, until ready to serve—a good 1½ hours.</p>

  <p class="indent">One-half hour later, add to the pot in which the meat has been cooking the whole, peeled turnips and carrots, the whites of the leeks, firmly tied into a bundle, and the apple.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cooking time depends on the age of the animal and the way in which it has been raised. Usually, today, one may count just under 3 hours for meat to be just right—tender, but still firm enough to be easily cut into slices. In the past, cookbooks recommended from 3½ to 4 hours—the animals were not killed so young as they are today, their diet was more natural, their flesh less tender and more flavorful.</p>

  <p class="indent">Discard the apple. Leave the cabbage to continue cooking while the soup is being served. The easiest and perhaps the most sympathetic way to serve the soup is directly from the <em>marmite</em>, leaving meats and vegetables in the pot to keep hot. Crusts of dried bread should be placed in each soup plate before the bouillon is ladled in and a piece of Parmesan and a grater (or a dish of grated cheese) should be at table for those who require it.</p>

  <p class="indent">Serve the meats, strings removed, on a separate platter from the vegetables to facilitate carving. Remove the cabbage quarters from their cooking liquid and surround them with all the vegetables from the <em>pot-au-feu</em>, first removing the strings from the leeks.</p>

  <p class="indent">A tureen of bouillon should be kept at table throughout the service to moisten meats and vegetables. The usual accompaniments are a dish of coarse salt, Dijon-type mustard and/or horseradish, and sour gherkins (or small dill pickles), of which the first is obligatory. Gherkins, if not too vinegary, are good with the meat, but will annihilate any wine.</p>
