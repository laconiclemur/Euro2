<p class="summary"><span class="italic">When Alicia e-mailed her friends asking for their favorite recipes, María Ortells sent this one for seafood paella, a specialty of Alicante. It is different from other seafood paellas in that the shrimp are peeled and the clams removed from their shells, so that you do not need to use your fingers to eat it. Presumably it is the way local young noblemen (</span>señoritos<span class="italic">)</span> <span class="italic">liked it. It has now caught on in the rest of Spain, where it is sometimes called</span> arroz de mariscos limpio <span class="italic">(clean) or</span> pelado <span class="italic">(peeled). It is less dramatic-looking than other seafood paellas but equally delicious and less messy to eat.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">In Alicante, they use dried</span> ñora <span class="italic">peppers (see page 128), but</span> pimentón <span class="italic">(or paprika) will do. The</span> ñoras <span class="italic">are soaked in boiling water for 30 minutes, then drained, cut open, and seeded; then the pulp is scraped from the skin with a spoon. (You only get about 1 teaspoon of pulp from each pepper.) Nowadays I can buy small baby squid less than a finger long, already cleaned. If the squid you buy has not been cleaned, see page 127 for instructions. You can use mussels instead of clams (see the variations) or small scallops. If you cannot buy good fish stock, use chicken stock.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">24 clams</p>
<p class="qun">1 large onion, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">5 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">4 garlic cloves, crushed to a paste or finely chopped</p>
<p class="qun">2 tomatoes, peeled and finely chopped</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">A good pinch of saffron threads</p>
<p class="qun">The pulp of 2 <span class="italic">ñora</span> peppers (see headnote above) or 1 teaspoon sweet <span class="italic">pimentón dulce</span> (or sweet paprika)</p>
<p class="qun">6 cleaned small squid, bodies cut into slices about ½ inch wide</p>
<p class="qun">2½ cups medium-grain Spanish paella rice or risotto rice, such as Arborio or Carnaroli</p>
<p class="qun">4½ cups fish stock</p>
<p class="qun">1 cup dry white wine</p>
<p class="qun">18 large shrimp, peeled</p>
<p class="qun">2 to 3 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley</p>
<p class="qun">6 lemon wedges</p>
<p class="qun1"><span class="italic">Alioli</span> (page 141)</p>
<p class="recsum">Scrub the clams and soak them in salted water for 30 minutes. Throw away any with broken shells or that do not shut when rapped sharply on the counter. Drain, put them in a pan with about ½ inch of water, cover, and bring to a boil. The clams will steam and open very quickly, and they will be cooked. Discard any that do not open. Take them out of their shells when they are cool enough to handle and set aside. Strain the liquid left in the pan and add it to the fish stock.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Fry the onion in the oil in a 16- to 18-inch paella pan until soft, stirring often. Stir in the garlic and, a few seconds later when the aroma rises, add the tomatoes and a little salt. Cook until the sauce is reduced and jammy and the oil is beginning to sizzle.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Add the saffron, the <span class="italic">ñora</span> pulp or <span class="italic">pimentón</span> (or paprika), and the squid to the sauce and stir well. Add the rice, stirring gently so that it gets well coated with the sauce.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Bring the stock and wine to a boil in a saucepan and pour over the rice, add a good amount of salt (the rice will need it, but the amount depends on the saltiness of the fish stock), and stir well, spreading the rice out evenly in the pan (do not stir the rice again during cooking). Bring to a boil and cook over high heat for 3 minutes, then reduce the heat to low and cook for 10 minutes. Move the pan occasionally, rotating it so that the rice cooks evenly.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Put the shrimp on top of the rice and cook for another 8 minutes, or until they have turned pink and the rice is done. Add the clams 3 minutes before the end to heat through. Add a little water if the paella becomes too dry. Remove from the heat, cover with foil, and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Sprinkle the paella with the parsley and serve with the lemon wedges and <span class="italic">alioli.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATIONS</span></p>
<p class="bl-first">• I often use scallops seared in oil in a skillet, instead of the clams, along with monkfish, cut into ¾-inch cubes and sautéed until tender.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• You can use mussels instead of clams. To clean them, see page 127.</p>
<p class="bl-last">• For a soupy <span class="italic">arroz caldoso a la marinera del señorito</span> use 7½ cups fish stock and no wine. Cook for just 20 minutes and serve at once, or the rice will fall apart.</p>
