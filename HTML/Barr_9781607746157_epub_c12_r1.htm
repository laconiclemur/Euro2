<div class="headnote" id="div1">I like mild stocks because I prefer to preserve the flavors of the foods that will be cooked with or in the stock as much as possible. For a more intense flavor and a darker color, you can roast the bones, meat, and vegetables in a 400°F oven for 30 to 45 minutes, or until they are browned, before you simmer them in the water with the seasonings. Ask your butcher for meaty bones to ensure a richly flavored stock. <span class="ornament_brown"><img alt="" class="inline" src="images/Barr_9781607746157_epub_L03_r1.jpg"/></span> <span class="yield"><span class="bold">Makes about 2 quarts</span></span></div>

<div class="headnote" id="div27">The heads and central bones, or fish frames, of white fish, such as snapper, cod, hake, or bass, make a mild but tasty stock. Avoid what the Spanish call <span class="italic">pescado azul</span>, or “blue fish,” such as tuna, sardines, and salmon, among others, which are fatty fish and yield a strongly flavored stock that can overwhelm other foods. Mussels are a good addition, as they impart a subtle flavor, and you can use the cooked mussels in another recipe, such as <a class="hlink" href="Barr_9781607746157_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03-sect43">Mussels in Vinegar and Wine</a>.

<div class="headnote" id="div41">I like this subtle and mild vegetable stock because it enhances every dish to which I add it.

<div class="headnote" id="div53">Although many think of mayonnaise as a French creation, Spaniards place its invention on the island of Minorca, where it was named after the capital city of Mahón. Not surprisingly, the French and the Minorcans have a different view of who first beat together eggs and oil, even on the island. According to the French, it was the chef employed by Duke Richelieu who came up with the sauce for a celebratory meal honoring the siege of Mahón in 1756. Spaniards, in contrast, believe that the duke’s chef picked up the secrets to the now-famous sauce by watching a humble Minorcan cook.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent" id="div54">Many other sauces can be made from this <a class="hlink" id="ind722a"/>basic recipe by simply adding herbs, anchovies, mustard, capers, or garlic. Homemade mayonnaise tastes much better than its commercial counterpart, and because it is easy to make and keeps well, it is worth whipping up a batch. For the best results, have all of your ingredients at room temperature. If you are concerned about using raw eggs, feel free to substitute a commercial product in recipes that call for mayonnaise. <span class="ornament_brown"><img alt="" class="inline" src="images/Barr_9781607746157_epub_L03_r1.jpg"/></span> <span class="yield"><span class="bold">Makes about 1 cup</span></span></div>

You can adjust the consistency of the sauce once the oil has been added. If you prefer a thinner mayonnaise, with the motor still running, add a little hot water or orange juice. If you prefer a thicker consistency, increase the blender speed to the maximum and blend for about 10 seconds.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div63">In the village of Vélez Blanco in Almería, the easternmost province of Andalusia, my friends Ludmila and Chencho Arias serve this sauce with grilled lamb chops and rice dishes. Green almonds are nuts that are picked early, usually in May in the United States, before the shell and the kernel have had a chance to harden. They are lime green on the outside and covered with a downy fuzz. This hull is easily cut with a knife and peeled away to reveal the still-soft, ivory nut. Green almonds can be difficult to find, unless you or a friend has an almond tree, although sometimes they are available at farmers’ markets or online directly from orchards. <span class="ornament_brown"><img alt="" class="inline" src="images/Barr_9781607746157_epub_L03_r1.jpg"/></span> <span class="yield"><span class="bold">Makes about 2 cups</span></span></div>

<div class="headnote" id="div74">The name of this sauce is derived from the Catalan <span class="italic">all i oli</span>, which means “garlic and oil,” and it is basically just that. Many people outside of Spain have the mistaken notion that the sauce contains eggs, but an authentic <span class="italic">alioli</span>, which is best described as a white and shiny sauce with a strong garlic flavor, does not. If you are not fond of garlic, you can use a smaller amount than the recipe calls for, or you can replace the recipe with Mayonnaise (left) to which you add a little garlic. I have found that mixing equal parts olive oil and another subtler vegetable oil, such as corn oil, makes a better emulsion than using solely olive oil, and adding a little water helps keep the emulsion from breaking, especially if you are using a blender, instead of making the sauce by hand as most Catalans do. (You can even use all corn oil, if you like.) If you decide to make the sauce in a mortar, make sure all the ingredients are at room temperature, omit the water, and proceed in the same sequence, being sure always to stir the mixture in the same direction to prevent the emulsion from breaking. <span class="ornament_brown"><img alt="" class="inline" src="images/Barr_9781607746157_epub_L03_r1.jpg"/></span> <span class="yield"><span class="bold">Makes about 1 cup</span></span></div>

<div class="textbox_text_indent" id="div87">Traditionally, <span class="italic">mojos</span> are made in a mortar with a pestle. Great results are possible with a blender, too, so I include instructions for both methods in my recipes.

<p class="nonindent" id="p8">Vinaigrettes and aromatic oils are great inventions: not only do they add flavor, enhancing the taste of the ingredients in everything from simple salads to elaborate appetizers, but they also give dishes an appealing touch of color. They keep well in the refrigerator and are easy to make. I usually prepare them in quantities of about 1 cup and store them in small plastic bottles. I have included recipes for ten vinaigrettes and oils that I regularly use. Once you try making these, you will want to experiment with your own creations using other ingredients.</p>

<div class="headnote" id="div269">Mastering this coating is indispensable if you want to make flan or similar desserts. If you are a beginner, the process can be tricky, but once you have made the caramel a few times, it becomes easy. I recommend that you start by preparing it in “slow motion” over low heat, and then when you get a feel for it, you can reduce the cooking time by increasing the heat. The amount of sugar used here will be enough for the recipes in this book, but you can use more or less, depending on your needs. If you have an unlined copper saucepan, use it here: copper conducts heat better than other metals. <span class="ornament_brown"><img alt="" class="inline" src="images/Barr_9781607746157_epub_L03_r1.jpg"/></span> <span class="yield"><span class="bold">Makes enough to coat 1 (5 by 9-inch) mold or 8 to 12 custard cups</span></span></div>

</div>
<div class="method" id="div272">Spread the sugar evenly in the bottom of a heavy saucepan and place over medium-low heat. It may take several minutes before the sugar begins to melt. Without stirring, watch the sugar closely as it begins to liquefy at the edges. All of it will slowly turn first into a yellowish and then a golden syrup and finally into a brown caramel sauce. When the liquefied sugar is turning from golden to brown, immediately remove the saucepan from the heat. (If you miss this point, the sugar will quickly turn too dark and taste bitter and you will need to discard it and begin again.) Working swiftly, pour the liquid caramel into the mold (or molds) and tilt to cover the bottom and sides evenly. It is important to do this transfer quickly, as the change in temperature causes the caramel to solidify rapidly.</div>
<div class="method" id="div273">Any bits of caramel stuck to the saucepan can be removed easily. Add water and bring to a boil; the caramel will liquefy, allowing you to pour it out and then wash the pan.</div>

<div class="method" id="div277">Pour the milk into a large pitcher or other vessel, preferably with a spout, cover with a kitchen towel, and let it stand at room temperature for 48 hours. It will sour and solidfy somewhat, forming soft curds.</div>
<div class="method" id="div278">Line a colander with cheesecloth and place over a large bowl. Pour the partially solidified milk into the colander. The whey will immediately begin to separate from the curds. Gather the ends of the cloth up and tie them in a knot to make a pouch. Hang the pouch from your kitchen sink faucet, or somewhere else less trafficked, and leave it to drain for 30 hours. When the pouch has stopped dripping completely, you will have fresh cheese with the consistency of thick sour cream.</div>
<div class="method" id="div279">Untie the pouch and scrape the cheese from the cloth into a bowl, cover, and refrigerate. It will keep for up to several days.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div280">The people of Gomera, in the Canary Islands, eat this cheese spread with white country-style bread and a glass of wine. They make it with an aged goat cheese, but I have made it with aged Manchego, which is readily available in the United States, with great success. <span class="ornament_brown"><img alt="" class="inline" src="images/Barr_9781607746157_epub_L03_r1.jpg"/></span> <span class="yield"><span class="bold">Makes about 2 cups</span></span></div>
<div class="ingredients" id="div281">
<div class="IL_item" id="div282"><span class="bold">3 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped</span></div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div283"><span class="bold">½ cup olive oil</span></div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div284"><span class="bold">1 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes</span></div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div285"><span class="bold">2 tomatoes, halved crosswise, grated on the large holes of a handheld grater, and skins discarded</span></div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div286"><span class="bold">½ pound Manchego cheese, grated</span></div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div287"><span class="bold">½ teaspoon salt</span></div>
</div>
<div class="method" id="div288">In a blender, combine the garlic, 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, and the red pepper flakes and process until a smooth paste forms. Add the tomatoes and cheese and process until well combined. With the motor running, add the remaining 7 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon at a time, processing until all the oil is fully incorporated. This should take about 2 minutes. The finished mixture should have a smooth, spreadable consistency. Alternatively, combine the garlic, 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, and the red pepper flakes in a mortar and pound with a pestle to form a smooth paste. Add the tomatoes, cheese, and salt and continue pounding and mixing until well combined. Add the remaining 7 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing with the pestle after each addition to incorporate the oil fully.</div>
<div class="method" id="div289">Transfer the spread to a bowl. If not using immediately, cover and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks.</div>
