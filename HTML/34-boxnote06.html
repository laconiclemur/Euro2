<h4><span class="red">fino</span></h4>
<p class="running_first">Fortified sherry wines are produced in the so-called Sherry Triangle in southern Spain between the towns of Jerez de la Frontera, Sanlúcar de Barrameda, and El Puerto de Santa María (across the bay from Cádiz). Sherries vary in type, color, and levels of dryness. They range from the palest, driest <em>finos</em> (literally “refined”) and manzanilla, through the warmer, rounded amber-hued amontillado with its hazelnut aromas, slightly darker nut-brown and aromatic oloroso, the mahogany-colored palo cortado and pale cream to the sweet, ebony-toned Pedro Ximénez.</p>
<p class="running_first">But it is fino that is the choice in the south to sip with a dish of olives or a couple of tapas. It’s a crisp, light sherry, straw-colored, with a slightly edgy taste. As it ferments, a layer of yeast called <em>flor</em> forms, which protects the wine from the air and also imparts its own unique, tangy flavor. Fino is aged in American oak barrels using the <em>sistema de criaderas y solera</em>, basically a way of blending older sherries with younger ones and rotating casks among a pyramid of barrels. They generally age about eight years, though in reality are a final blend of different harvests, with at least a touch of the oldest in each barrel. Vintages, then, play no part in the conversation about finos.</p>
<p class="running_first">Fino produced around the port of Sanlúcar de Barrameda is called manzanilla. The name is the same in Spanish as for chamomile tea, of which it is (vaguely) reminiscent in flavor. Manzanilla uses Palomino grapes grown in the chalky <em>albariza</em> soil, which are harvested during the first half of September. While the method of producing it is the same as with fino, the salty humidity of Sanlúcar de Barrameda, located at the mouth of the Guadalquivir River, means that a thicker, more protective layer of flor forms. Manzanilla is more delicate-tasting than other finos, and, aficionados like to say, carries salty hints from the sea estuaries where it is produced. It is best served quite chilled, ideally between 44 to 48°F/7 to 9°C. The public has latched on to this tremendous drink, and recently manzanilla has surpassed other finos in popularity.</p>
<p class="running_first">Among the many excellent manzanilla producers, La Gitana and La Guita stand out. Both make bright manzanillas, the color of very pale straw, and carry clean, breezy aromas that recall green apples, yeast, and the humid seaside. On the tongue, the wines are light and dry, with a tangy but fresh finish.</p>
<p class="running_first">Sitting in one of Sanlúcar’s legendary tapas bars with a glass of manzanilla and a couple of tapas is one of Spain’s culinary highlights.</p>
