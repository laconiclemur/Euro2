			<p class="rec-intro">This has long been a favourite on the menu at Le Gavroche and it’s a French classic that we now make with British snails. There’s quite a bit of work involved, as you need to make a hollandaise to enrich the creamy sauce, but it’s well worth the effort. </p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 8</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">500g curly parsley, picked and washed</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">400ml double cream</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">24 cooked langoustines</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">3 large shallots, peeled</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">250ml dry white wine</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">300ml fish stock (see <a href="part0010_split_008.html#Fish-stock" class="calibre4">here</a>)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">½ tbsp ground piment d’Espelette (chilli powder)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 tsp unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">24 cooked snails (canned or vacuum packed are fine)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">salt</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">black pepper</p>
			<p class="for-the">Hollandaise sauce</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 tbsp white wine vinegar</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">3 tbsp white wine</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 tbsp water</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">4 free-range egg yolks</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">250g clarified butter (see <a href="part0010_split_018.html#butter-sauce" class="calibre4">here</a>)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">salt</p>

			<p class="body">First make the hollandaise. Put the vinegar, wine and water into a heavy-based pan and bring to the boil. Add a pinch of salt, remove the pan from the heat and leave to cool. Whisk in the egg yolks, then place the pan over a very gentle heat and keep whisking, making sure the whisk comes into contact with the whole base of the pan. After 8–10 minutes the yolks will have emulsified and you can increase the heat a little. The mixture should not exceed 68°C – if too hot the yolks will scramble – and should become smooth and thick enough to form peaks. Take the pan off the heat and whisk in the clarified butter, then cover and keep the sauce in a warm place for later. </p>
			<p class="body">Bring a pan of salted water to the boil, add the parsley and blanch for 4–5 minutes. Drain, keeping the water, then refresh the parsley in iced water. Drain it again well, pressing to extract excess water. Heat 100ml of the cream to boiling point. Put the parsley in a blender with a pinch of salt and the hot cream, then blitz until smooth, adding a little cooking water if needed.</p>
			<p class="body">Shell the langoustines and slice 2 of the shallots. Put the shallots in a pan with the wine and 6 of the langoustine heads, breaking them up with a spatula, then add a little salt and boil until the pan is almost dry. Add the stock and boil again until reduced by half, then add the rest of cream. Once the mixture has the consistency of a sauce, pass it through a fine sieve, then stir in the hollandaise and season with a little of the Espelette pepper. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="body">Chop the remaining shallot. Warm a teaspoon of the butter in a pan and add the snails with the shallot and garlic. Warm through, making sure you don’t burn the garlic, then remove the snails and set them aside. Add the rest of the butter to the pan and heat until foaming. Toss the langoustines in the Espelette pepper, then add them to the pan to warm through. Preheat the grill. Take 8 heatproof bowls and add 3 snails, 3 langoustines and a little parsley purée to each one. Cover with the sauce, then place the bowls under the hot grill to glaze. Serve immediately.</p>
