			<p class="rec-intro">Cornish squid doesn’t sound very French but it goes beautifully with this classic salt cod purée, which is a brasserie favourite. The brandade is also delicious just as it is with a little toast rubbed with a clove of garlic.</p>

			<p class="body">Put the salt cold in a large bowl with a copious amount of fresh water and leave it in the fridge for 48 hours, changing the water at least 4 times. </p>
			<p class="body">Cook the potato on a bed of rock salt in a hot oven (220°C/Fan 200°C/Gas 7) until tender, then pass it through a potato ricer and keep warm. Drain the soaked cod and put it in a large saucepan. Pour in the milk to cover and add the bay leaves, thyme and garlic cloves, bruising them first to release their flavour. Bring the milk just up to the boil and then turn off the heat. Leave the fish to rest in the milk for 15 minutes, then carefully flake the flesh, discarding any bones and skin. Set the milk aside.</p>
			<p class="body">This next part takes a little skill, as the more olive oil you can emulsify into the brandade the more indulgent the texture will be. Too little oil and the purée will be coarse; too much and it will be an oily mess on the plate. </p>
			<p class="body">Start by putting the flaked cod in a food processor with a quarter of its volume of potato. Add a few tablespoons of the poaching milk and start to blend the mixture. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil, as if you were making mayonnaise, until you have a silky smooth mixture. You might need to add a little more milk if the mixture is getting too claggy or more potato if it seems too wet. Season the mixture with white pepper and possibly, although unlikely, a little sea salt. Keep the mixture warm while you cook the squid. </p>
			<p class="body">Empty the squid ink into a pan, add a tablespoon of the cod cooking milk and warm it through. Cut the squid bodies into rings and leave the bunches of tentacles whole. Season the squid lightly and cook them briefly on a very hot griddle. Spoon the warm brandade on to hot plates and add some squid and a drizzle of squid ink. Sprinkle with piment d’Espelette and white pepper and add parsley if you like. </p>
			<p class="body">You can make the brandade ahead of time and keep it in the fridge. When you’re ready to serve, tip it into a pan, add a splash of milk and warm it through gently over a very low heat, making sure it doesn’t burn. </p>
