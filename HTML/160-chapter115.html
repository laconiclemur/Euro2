<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">This simple grilled quail dish topped with a fragrant, garlic-laden olive oil and white wine sauce is perfect for an end-of-summer lunch, when this migratory bird is prevalent across much of Spain. (Farm-raised ones are found in markets year-round.) I first encountered this typical and straightforward country way of preparing quail in a <em>venta</em> (simple roadside restaurant) in the rolling, red-soiled hills of central Andalucía. Serve it with a green salad and a plate of potatoes, either fried <a href="94-chapter66.html#page_132"><span class="red">(see page 132)</span></a>, puréed <a href="83-chapter58.html#page_117"><span class="red">(see page 117)</span></a>, or made in the oven baker’s style <a href="81-chapter56.html#page_116"><span class="red">(see page 116)</span></a>. Don’t overcook the birds. They should be moist, and the breast meat still a bit pink.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>8 CLEANED WHOLE QUAIL (NOT BONELESS), ABOUT 7 OUNCES/200 G EACH</li>
<li>SALT AND FRESHLY GROUND BLACK PEPPER</li>
<li>½&gt; CUP/60 ML EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL, PLUS MORE FOR OILING PAN</li>
<li>4 GARLIC CLOVES, CHOPPED</li>
<li>¼ CUP/60 ML DRY WHITE WINE</li>
<li>2 TABLESPOONS MINCED FRESH FLAT-LEAF PARSLEY</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Using poultry or kitchen shears, and beginning in the cavity, cut the quail through the breast and open like a book until flat. Trim the neck and the tips of the legs. Tap on the ribcage with the closed shears to slightly loosen the meat from the bones. Generously season both sides with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> Preheat a grill pan, griddle pan, or large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat and lightly oil. Working in batches as needed, grill the quail until done but still pink in the breast, about 10 minutes, being careful not to break the skin. (Smaller birds take 1 to 2 minutes less.) Transfer to a platter and loosely cover with aluminum foil tented in the middle to keep warm. Re-oil the pan if necessary between batches.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Meanwhile, in a small saucepan or skillet, heat the ½&gt; cup olive oil and garlic over medium-low heat until the garlic is tender and fragrant but still pale, about 2 minutes. Carefully add the wine and bring to a boil. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk until cloudy.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Place two quail on each plate, spoon over some of the sauce with pieces of garlic, and sprinkle with the parsley. Serve immediately.</p>
