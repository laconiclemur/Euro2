<h5 class="h5"><a id="pageid_23"/><b>Chili Crème Anglaise</b></h5>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">MAKES</span></b> 5¼ cups</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 20 minutes, plus 30 minutes infusing and at least 1 hour chilling</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 15 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 quart whole milk</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 long red chili, halved lengthwise and seeded</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 vanilla bean, halved lengthwise and seeds scraped out</p>
<p class="acktxt">8 egg yolks</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 cup sugar</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Put the milk in a saucepan over low heat. Add the chili and vanilla seeds. Whisk, then throw in the vanilla bean as well. Bring to a boil, then remove the pan from the heat, cover with plastic wrap and leave to infuse at room temperature 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Meanwhile, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar in a large bowl. Strain the chili-infused milk through a fine strainer onto the egg yolk mixture and mix well, then pour it back into the pan. Put over medium heat and simmer 5 to 8 minutes, stirring continuously (otherwise you will get scrambled eggs!) until the mixture starts to thicken. You will be able to tell when the crème anglaise is ready if you run two fingers down the back of the spoon and the two lines don’t immediately join. If the custard does start to scramble, don’t panic—you can rescue it by pouring the mixture into a food processor and blitzing it until it regains a smooth, thick texture.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Strain the sauce once more into a clean bowl and mix a few minutes to cool the custard, then put it in the refrigerator to chill at least 1 hour. It will keep in a covered container in the refrigerator about a week.</p>
