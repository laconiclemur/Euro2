  <h3 class="h3a">Pearl barley and cavolo nero soup</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">I love pearl barley and often use it in soups or as a substitute for rice. <em class="calibre4">Cavolo nero</em> is a loose-leafed Tuscan cabbage with very dark green, almost black, leaves – hence its Italian name, which translates as ‘black cabbage’. As well as being tasty, both pearl barley and cavolo nero are very nutritious, and this easy-to-prepare soup is a complete meal in itself. Both ingredients can be found in good supermarkets.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">150g/5½oz pearl barley</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra to drizzle</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 onion, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">400g/14oz cavolo nero, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 large potato, peeled and cubed</p>

  <p class="ing1">115g/4oz tomatoes, chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 litre/1¾ pints/4 cups <a href="part0007_split_013.html#ch1sec12a" class="calibre1">vegetable broth</a></p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 slices of country bread, toasted, to serve (optional)</p>

  <p class="ing2">grated Parmesan, to serve (optional)</p>

  <p class="para">Rinse the barley and put it in a saucepan; add cold water to cover. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat, cover with a lid and simmer for 1 hour, until the barley is cooked. Drain well and set aside.</p>

  <p class="para">Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan, add the onion and sweat for 5 minutes. Stir in the cavolo nero, potato and tomatoes. Add the cooked barley and the broth and season with salt and pepper. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover with a lid and cook for 40 minutes.</p>

  <p class="para1">Remove from the heat, add a drizzle of olive oil and serve with toasted country bread and grated Parmesan if desired.</p>
