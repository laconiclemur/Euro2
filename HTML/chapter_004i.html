<h2 class="h2b">BOURRIDE DE VOLAILLE</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Poached Chicken with Aïoli</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>This is an easier to eat and probably moister version of</em> poule au pot, <em>thickened at the last with aïoli to enrich and enliven the broth. It is important to cook the vegetables and different cuts of chicken at different times so that everything cooks just so. You will have plenty of the stock left over: you can either freeze it or make a simple soup the next day, adding a few leeks and potatoes</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
1 medium chicken<br/>
2 large onions, peeled and quartered<br/>
6 garlic cloves, peeled<br/>
1 bouquet garni (2 bay leaves, large sprig fresh thyme or savory)<br/>
4 small leeks, trimmed and washed<br/>
4 small turnips, peeled and halved<br/>
2 large carrots, peeled and halved<br/>
½ recipe <em>Aïoli</em> (<em><a href="chapter_003k.html#page92">see here</a></em>)<br/>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>
1 bunch fresh chives, chopped</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 180°C/350°F/Gas 4.</p>
<p class="normala">Portion the chicken, removing first the legs and then the breasts. Separate the legs into thigh and drumstick, and cut each breast in two widthways. Break the carcass in half and put it in a large deep pot, cover with water, bring to the boil and skim. Add the onions, garlic and bouquet garni and simmer for 45 minutes. Add the leeks, turnips and carrots and simmer for 15 minutes more. Add the chicken leg pieces and, after 20 minutes, the breast pieces. Lower the heat and cook at just under simmering point for a final 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="normala">While this is cooking, make the aïoli. Set aside in a cool place.</p>
<p class="normala">Remove and discard the carcass and the bouquet garni. Taste and season the stock. Pour 4 ladles of the stock into a smaller pan, boil it and then whisk it slowly into the aïoli as if making another mayonnaise. Be careful not to add it too quickly or it will separate. Add the chives to this sauce, and return to the small pan to keep warm, but do not re-boil. Lift the vegetables and chicken out of the unthickened stock, and serve in deep bowls covered with the aïoli-thickened broth.</p>
