			<p class="rec-intro">There are now wild boar all over France, even in the suburbs of some major cities. The meat is delicious when slow cooked, and I particularly enjoy the shoulder on the bone. I have a regular supply of wild boar from my brother-in-law Gérard, who shoots them in the Cévennes hills. Farmed boar is now available in many butchers and tastes good, but might not need to be cooked for quite so long. Start this the day before you want to eat it as the meat needs to marinate for 24 hours. Barley risotto is an excellent accompaniment.</p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 6</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 x 4–5kg wild boar shoulder</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">3 tbsp red wine vinegar</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">3 tbsp brandy</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">3 tbsp olive oil</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 bay leaves</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 piments d’Espelette (whole dried chillies), cut in half </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">8 garlic cloves, peeled</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 onions, peeled and sliced</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">200ml crème de cassis</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">300ml water</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">salt</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">black pepper</p>

			<p class="body">Make small incisions with a sharp knife all over the boar shoulder. Place it in a plastic bag and add the vinegar, brandy, oil, bay leaves and piments d’Espelette. Seal the bag and leave the meat to marinate in the fridge for 24 hours. </p>
			<p class="body">When you’re ready to cook, preheat the oven to 220°C/Fan 200°C/Gas 7. Take the meat out of the bag and drain off the marinade – set it aside for later, including the chillies and bay. Season the meat, place it in a roasting tin and put it in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Then add the peeled garlic, sliced onions, the marinade and crème de cassis, turn the oven down to 160°C/Fan 140°C/Gas 3 and cook for a further 10 minutes. Add 300ml water, cover loosely with foil and continue to cook for a further 4 hours until the meat is tender and falling off the bone. </p>
			<p class="body">The cooking liquid should be of sauce consistency, but if not, transfer it to a pan and boil until reduced and syrupy. You may need to skim off a little fat. I prefer to leave the garlic, onions and chilli in the sauce but if you want it silky smooth, press it through a fine sieve. Carve the meat and serve with the sauce and barley risotto (see <a href="part0007_split_026.html#Barley-risotto">here</a>).</p>
