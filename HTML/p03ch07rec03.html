</div>
<p class="summary">Spain is the biggest producer and biggest exporter in the world of olive oil<span class="bi">.</span> Much of its exports have been in bulk, and the main market is Italy, where the oil is either consumed or repackaged in beautiful bottles and exported as Italian or Tuscan extra virgin oil. But a good variety of Spanish extra virgin olive oils are now enjoying a worldwide reputation for quality; twenty have been awarded a <span class="italic">Denominación de Origen</span> (DO) seal of quality. Olive trees grow everywhere except in the northern regions. Parts of the undulating Andalusian landscape, where once there were wheat, grapes, barley, oats, chickpeas, and all kinds of vegetables, are now entirely covered by olive trees.</p>
<p class="summary">The history of olive oil in Spain is ancient. A good deal of what I know about it I learned from my friend Alicia Ríos, who wrote a book on the subject with Lourdes March called <span class="italic">La Cocina del Aceite de Oliva</span> (<span class="italic">Cooking with Olive Oil</span>). She is also a <span class="italic">catador,</span> or master taster, and an official ambassador of olive oil who organizes events and performances.</p>
<p class="summary">Olive trees have deep roots and need very little water. They thrive in the Mediterranean climate. It is claimed that some trees in Spain are five hundred or even more than one thousand years old. Could this be true? When I was growing up in Egypt, my Catholic nanny went on a pilgrimage and came back with a small branch from an olive tree under which the pregnant Virgin Mary was supposed to have stopped to rest. The Phoenicians are said to have introduced olive oil in Spain and the Greeks to have planted the first trees, but it was the Romans who planted them on an industrial scale over much of the peninsula. The oil was sent to Rome and throughout the empire for lighting, soap, and cosmetic, medicinal, and liturgical purposes; a top-quality oil, <span class="italic">olio flos,</span> was for cooking and preserving foods. The Arabs brought more olive tree varieties and ways of cultivating them. The Spanish words for olive, <span class="italic">aceituna,</span> and for oil, <span class="italic">aceite,</span> come from the Arabic <span class="italic">al zaitun</span> and <span class="italic">al zait</span>. But an alternate Spanish word for olive is <span class="italic">oliva,</span> an olive tree is <span class="italic">olivo,</span> and an olive grove is <span class="italic">olivar,</span> all derived from the Latin <span class="italic">oleum</span>. Oil mills or presses are <span class="italic">molino,</span> from the Latin, and <span class="italic">almazara</span> or <span class="italic">almassera,</span> from the Arabic.</p>
<p class="summary">When I was invited to take part in a conference on olive oil tourism in Seville, I talked about the time when in Seville and cities like Toledo and Córdoba you could tell the religious background of people who lived in every house as you walked through the narrow streets because of the smells of the cooking fats. The Christians used pork fat, the Muslims mostly clarified butter, and the Jews only olive oil. Pork fat was a badge of Christian identity. For a long time after 1492, everyone was afraid of using olive oil for fear of being suspected of being a “secret” Jew and punished for it by the Inquisition.</p>
<p class="summary">Speakers at the conference discussed future olive oil “routes,” tourist visits to oil producers and olive plantations, harvest festivals, organized tastings, seminars, and cooking demonstrations. We were treated to a trip around the countryside to visit old olive oil mills. Some were really ancient, with massive conical stone grinders and spherical millstones that were once turned by donkeys—relics of another era that may not have changed much since Muslim and even Roman times. A beautifully designed modern museum took us through the different methods of making olive oil. Many of those on the trip were from families that had produced olive oil for generations.</p>
<p class="summary">Until the civil war, small family presses could be found all over Spain. Franco’s government encouraged the formation of large cooperatives that produced huge quantities of olive oil. The goal of the industry was to produce quantity, without much regard to taste. But, according to José Ramón Guzmán Alvarez, professor at the University of Córdoba, even before that the taste had rarely been good and Spanish olive oil had always had a bad reputation. In an essay entitled “La Génesis de los Paisajes Olivareros: Siglos XVI–XX” (“The Genesis of the Olive Grove Landscape: XVI–XX Centuries”), he explains that because the seigneurial landlords had exclusive milling rights until 1837, and there were not enough communal mills to provide for all the smaller olive growers, they would have to wait their turn for days and maybe weeks for their olives to be pressed, by which time the olives would have gone bad. The big landowners in Andalusia might have produced some good oil for their own personal consumption, but they could always profit from selling the oil for lighting and soap. They also sold it to England as a lubricant for the factories that were operating during the industrial revolution.</p>
<p class="summary">You can see why the traditional cooking of Spain was with lard—it tasted better and it was made by families themselves. There were a few producers of decent olive oil by the end of the nineteenth century, especially in Catalonia, which had a prosperous bourgeoisie and French and Italian restaurateurs who liked to use olive oil as well as butter. But even then the cooking in Catalonia was never only with olive oil. It also used lard, often mixing the two. Nowadays, from what I hear from young people in Catalonia, they no longer use lard, for health reasons and because commercial lard is not as good as the home-rendered pork fat of the past (but in the countryside, they still do). The Catalan food historian and gastronome Néstor Luján wrote that some people in Catalonia still think that when olive oil became more common than lard, food lost much of its charm. In the south and along the Mediterranean coast, olive oil continued to be used despite the historical prejudice associating it with “secret” Jews, yet it wasn’t until the late nineteenth century that Spanish cookery writers began to extol its virtues over lard. Most of the recipes they featured in their books were French, and by then lard was associated with poor peasant food.</p>
<p class="summary">José Ramón Guzmán writes that it was only during the First World War, when Italy’s demand for olive oil rose enormously, that olive groves were expanded over the Andalusian hills. And it is only in the last twenty years or so that domestic and world demand increased phenomenally and created the spur for intensive monoculture of olive trees. The European Union has given subsidies to olive plantations, and international campaigns have boosted the consumption of olive oil by promoting the healthful aspects of the Mediterranean diet. Star chefs of the Basque Country and Catalonia started using olive oil rather than pork fat in their dishes, and TV chefs advocated the healthful and gastronomic qualities of the oil while sloshing great amounts into their pans. Enterprising olive oil producers bought the latest state-of-the-art technology from Italy and put all their efforts into creating the best conditions for every aspect of oil production, from growing and harvesting to pressing, blending, and bottling. Many producers of high-quality oils now own their own olive groves. There has been a revolution in olive oil production just as there has been one in wine. It has resulted in extra virgin olive oils comparable in quality to Spain’s Iberian pig products.</p>
