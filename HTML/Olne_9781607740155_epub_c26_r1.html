  <p class="nonindent sgc-1"><a id="page356"></a>Everything in this dinner is simple, classical and sober in spirit—no fantasy, no breathtaking presentations, no “guess-what’s-in-it” flavors.</p>

  <p class="indent">The presentation of the first course may advantageously be thrown into relief by a harlequin or mosaic pattern of black (olives), white (the whites of hard-boiled eggs), and bright green (tarragon leaves) against the background of warm tomato red and pale artichoke green whose definitions are softened in the amber suffusion of the jelly. The firm, velvety texture of the liver mousse (which, incidentally, in a simpler meal forms a perfect hors d’oeuvre in itself), the concentrated richness and sensuous quality of a trembling natural meat jelly that melts on the tongue, the refreshing slight acidity of the tomato mousse and the clean savor of the artichoke bottoms form an intricate juxtaposition of flavors and textures in which each retains its identity.</p>

  <p class="indent">The <em>suite</em> represents not only a switch from cold to hot, but from involved to simple and from vibrant to suave and soothing. The fillets are masked in an essence of their own flavor, heightened by the herbs and cucumbers. In effect, it is a unified experience in taste and color.</p>

  <p class="indent">From simple to radically simple and from delicate to robust, the roast is climactic.</p>

  <p class="indent">The progression is a particularly happy one for inquisitive palates, and ideal for the presentation of a selection of fine wines, for, with the exception of the dessert, which needs no wine, and the first course, which is accompanied perfectly by the slight, dry white wine that is also an ideal preface to a gamut of finer wines. (If champagne were served as apéritif to “set the tone,” it would be better to continue with the same or another champagne with the first course, for the first course wines suggested would suffer by comparison.) Each preparation is of a nature to enhance a wine. The fish alone requires a particular kind of wine; under other circumstances, a <em>gigot</em> may be accompanied equally well by a fresh country wine, a 6-months-old Beaujolais, or a venerable <em>grand seigneur</em>). If a fine bottle has been chosen for the cheeses, avoid cheeses of the strong-flavored fermented varieties. A good selection would be: a dry, nutty-flavored Swiss Gruyère (but not an Emmenthal), a fresh goat cheese, and a fresh, creamy Reblochon.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page357"></a>The first course and all the elements of the dessert will have been prepared far ahead of time. The preliminary preparations for the fish course (except for the actual poaching and the finishing of the sauce—15 minutes) may be done in advance. The cucumbers may be prepared and parboiled, and the beans and roast prepared for cooking ahead of time. There is little to do at the last minute, but one must organize one’s time, for neither the fish nor the green beans can wait. In the recipe I have indicated a 20-minute period of “relaxation” for the leg of lamb, but that time, fortunately, is flexible. The meal may be begun 15 minutes after the roast has been put to cook. Don’t try to prepare the fish until the first course is nearly finished (it is good to wait a bit between courses, and as long as the guests’ glasses contain wine, everything is all right). It is best to have the boiling water in readiness for the beans, but do not begin to cook them until after the roast has been put to “relax.”</p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon cognac</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup heavy whipping cream</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">The artichokes may be prepared a day in advance. Prepare them, using the lemon, salt and thyme, exactly as indicated on <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#rh2">this page</a>.</p>

  <p class="center4" id="rh88"><span class="small">THE VEAL JELLY</span></p>

  <p class="center2">(to be prepared the day before)</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Cover the calf’s foot with cold water, bring to a boil, and simmer for 15 minutes. Drain it, rinse it in cold water, and place it in a <em>marmite</em> or large saucepan along with the veal and chicken pieces. Add enough cold water to cover generously (there should be enough so that, when all the vegetables are added, they are just covered), place the pot over a medium flame and, as the boiling point nears, begin to skim off the scum that rises to the top. When the boil is reached, pour in about ⅓ cup of cold water. More scum will rise to the top. Continue skimming and repeat the process 3 or 4 more times, adding cold water in between each skimming—this is absolutely essential for a limpid jelly. Add the vegetables, peeled and cut into pieces, the aromatic elements, tied together, and a small handful of coarse salt (not too much, for evaporation must be taken into consideration, and seasoning may always be adjusted later), and continue to skim as before for a few minutes. Adjust the heat so that the barest simmer is produced at the liquid’s surface (if you are working with a gas flame, use an asbestos pad to help disperse the heat so that it may be regulated more meticulously). <a id="page359"></a>Leave to cook for about 6 hours. Don’t stir or disturb the contents during this time except to skim off any fat floating on the surface every hour or so. At the end of the cooking time, gently pour the contents of the saucepan into a fine sieve suspended over a large mixing bowl. Remove the sieve without pressing the contents or stirring them around and pass the liquid again—this time through a cloth placed over the sieve. If all of the operations have been carried out as described, the result should be a succulent deep honey in color, and transparent. Taste at this point and add more salt if necessary (remembering that, hot, it will taste slightly more seasoned than when it is cold). Leave to cool and, when jelled, lift off any solid fat that has formed on the surface, then wipe the surface of the jelly with a towel dampened with hot water to remove any traces of fat that may remain. If the jelly is limpid, further clarification may be eliminated. The process is explained below because, despite detailed explanations, first attempts at making jelly often produce a cloudy product. Before clarification, put aside a cupful of jelly to serve in the confection of the tomato mousse.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE CLARIFICATION</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Heat the jelly until melted, add the herbs and the stiffly beaten egg whites. Over a high flame, using a whisk, beat the mixture until it boils. Lower the flame to avoid its frothing over the edge and continue whisking for 4 or 5 minutes. Pass the liquid first through cheesecloth, then through a piece of linen or other finely woven cloth.</p>

  <p class="indent">If the jelly is to be used immediately, wait until it is nearly cold and add the glass of wine; in any case, wait until just before using to add the wine (the reheating necessary to melt the jelly damages the wine’s perfume).</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE TOMATO MOUSSE</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Peel and seed the tomatoes and chop the pulp coarsely. Peel the onion, chop it finely and cook it gently in butter for 10 minutes without allowing it to brown. Add the white wine and, over a high flame, reduce by half. Add the tomatoes and the seasoning and leave to cook gently, covered, for ½ hour. At the end of this time, if it seems to be too liquid, turn the fire up for a couple of minutes and reduce, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Add the cupful of jelly that has been put aside, <a id="page360"></a>boil for a couple of minutes and pass through a very fine sieve with the help of a wooden pestle. Taste for seasoning—it should be highly seasoned, for the addition of the cream will sweeten and attenuate it greatly. Immerse the saucepan in a basin of cold water and stir until the tomato mixture is cold, changing the water if necessary, or adding ice cubes to it. Whip the cream until it is good and frothy but not stiff (this way the mousse will be moist and velvety on the tongue—if the cream is whipped stiff, the result will be dry and cottony) and mix it into the tomato sauce. Pour into a deep serving platter or crystal dish and place in the refrigerator to solidify. It is wise to embed the dish in cracked ice to hasten this process.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE CHICKEN LIVER MOUSSE</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Check the livers carefully, cutting off any edges that may be greenish or discolored and consequently bitter from having contacted the gall. Peel and chop the onion finely. Heat 2 tablespoons of butter in a small frying pan, add the livers, salt, herbs and a generous amount of freshly ground pepper. Toss them and turn them around for a minute or two— just the time necessary for them to become firm to the touch. They must remain rare. Add the cognac, set fire to it, and pass the contents of the frying pan through a fine sieve. Mix in thoroughly the remaining butter (which has been kept out of the refrigerator to soften), whip the cream (the directions for the cream in the tomato mousse hold for all mousses) and mix it into the liver mixture. Leave to partly stiffen in the refrigerator and then fill the artichoke hearts (first sponged dry with a paper towel), piling the chicken liver mousse in a dome and smoothing the surface with the concave surface of a spoon.</p>

  <p class="indent">Arrange the stuffed artichoke bottoms on the jelled bed of tomato mousse. A simple décor may be executed with the help of pieces of hard-boiled egg white, tarragon leaves dipped into boiling water to render them supple, slices of black olive, etc. (these elements should all be dipped first in jelly before placing them in position), or the dish may simply be decorated, after being masked in jelly, with small bouquets of chervil.</p>

  <p class="indent">If the jelly has been allowed to stiffen, heat it just enough for it to be completely melted, allow to cool slightly and stir in the glass of <a id="page361"></a>wine. Place small quantities at a time (¼ to ⅓ cup) in a bowl embedded in cracked ice, turn it with a tablespoon and, as it begins to thicken, pour it, a spoonful at a time (but deftly, for once the thickening begins, it rapidly turns to solid jelly) over all the elements of the dish, concentrating on the peaks of liver mousse, as much will flow down to coat the bed of tomato mousse. Repeat this process, filling the bowl when necessary, until all the jelly is used and the entire dish is masked evenly in amber transparence.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c26-s98"><em><span class="color">Sole Fillets with Fines Herbes</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Filets de Sole aux Fines Herbes</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 fish, each weighing from 1 to 1½ pounds (Dover sole, lemon sole, grey sole, or flounder), or 12 fillets and an equivalent quantity of carcasses, heads, etc., from fish of the same varieties</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Fumet:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 onion</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 small carrot</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 clove garlic</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>carcasses and trimmings of fish</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>herbs</em> (<em>thyme, bay leaf, fennel, parsley</em>)</p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>healthy pinch of salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup of dry white wine</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>10 ounces fresh unsalted butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon each of chopped parsley and chervil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 teaspoon chopped tarragon</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, pepper to taste</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Genuine Dover sole, unhappily, does not exist in American waters. Dover sole is flown in, but the price is high and it can only be found in fancy fish shops in large cities. Lemon sole, grey sole and flounder cannot compare with it either in delicacy of flavor or in the moist firmness of the flesh, but must usually by substituted. The results, however, are satisfactory.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page362"></a>This is the basic recipe—extremely simple in execution—of its type: poached fish fillets with a mounted butter sauce. There are literally hundreds of variations, but it is only necessary to succeed with one to be assured of success with all of them, for the method never changes—only the poaching liquid and the garnish. The poaching liquid may be a fish <em>fumet</em> made from either white or red wine, mushroom cooking liquid, the cooking liquid from mussels, a special wine (port, champagne, Château d’Yquem, Chambertin, etc.), or any combination of these. The preparation may be enriched by the addition of mussels, shrimp, mushrooms, shallots, truffles (certain “chic” restaurants add caviar to the sauce, to the detriment of both caviar and sauce—one, to my knowledge, adds both caviar and whiskey plus a few salmon eggs for color!). The fillets may remain flat, or be folded or rolled. They may be stuffed, usually with a base of mousseline forcemeat (sole, salmon, pike, or whiting) to which may be added a certain amount of <em>duxelles</em>, chopped truffles, chopped pistachio nuts, etc. The character of the sauce may be totally transformed by the addition of a special condiment (saffron, curry, etc.). Despite these and many other variations, the basic physical structure of the sauce remains constant.</p>

  <p class="indent">Assuming a few simple rules to be borne in mind, the miracle never fails to occur, and each time one is left in wonder that butter alone can thicken a sauce. Because it contains neither farinaceous agents nor egg-yolk emulsion, and does not require an extended cooking process, it is perhaps the finest-textured, the purest in flavor, and the most easily digestible of all sauce types.</p>

  <p class="indent">The following details must absolutely be respected:</p>

  <p class="extract1">(1) The cooking vessel should be of a heavy material that takes heat evenly and slowly and holds it long (heavy copper, earthenware, or enameled ironware).</p>

  <p class="indent">(2) The fillets must be poached, <em>not</em> boiled.</p>

  <p class="indent">(3) The cooking liquid should be reduced to the consistency of a light syrup and removed immediately from the flame. One must sense the right moment. It must pass, first through a period of frothy “foaming up,” then settled into a regular boil, which is soon transformed into a rapid staccato surface bubbling. Several seconds later it will arrive <a id="page363"></a>at the precise consistency desired. There should be but a few spoonfuls of liquid remaining.</p>

  <p class="indent">(4) The butter should be removed from the refrigerator ahead of time, cut into small pieces and allowed to soften.</p>

  <p class="extract1">A preparation of this nature in a restaurant would be “glazed” just before serving; that is to say, once the sauce is finished and poured over the fish fillets, the serving dish is placed for a very few seconds under a very intense heat, which immediately browns the surface without penetrating the main body of the preparation or altering the sauce. This is hardly to be recommended in home kitchens, for they are never equipped with a grill powerful enough, and a prolonged stay beneath the usual flame could only result in overcooked fish floating in a disintegrated and oily sauce.</p>

  <p class="indent">If the fish are bought whole, ask the fish merchant to fillet them, saving the carcasses. Or do it yourself—the experience is useful. Make an incision from top to bottom at the base of the tail, loosen the cut edge of the skin and, using a towel to ensure a firmer grip, hold the tail firmly with the left hand while ripping off the skin, the tip of which is also grasped with a towel, with the right hand. Repeat the procedure on the other side. Using a sharp, flexible boning knife, make an incision the length of the fish on each flat side, following the visible central line, corresponding to the spinal column, which separates the fillets. Starting at the head end and holding the knife firmly so that the blade, at an extreme angle, is nearly flat against the bones, slice carefully, but decisively, while lifting the fillet loose with the other hand. Trim the fillets neatly, removing any parts that may have been discolored by contact with blood, and the lacy edges that often contain tiny fin bones. Remove the eyes and gills and discard them, cut each carcass into 4 or 5 pieces and put these aside with the trimmings. Put the fillets to soak in a basin of cold water.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE FUMET</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Peel the onion and the carrot and slice them thinly. Smash the clove of garlic. Combine fish trimmings, vegetables, herbs and seasoning in <a id="page364"></a>a saucepan, pour the wine over, and add enough water to just cover. Bring to a boil and leave, covered, to simmer for ½ hour. Pour the contents of the saucepan into a sieve, placed over a mixing bowl, and press the solids well with a wooden pestle to extract all the juices.</p>

  <p class="indent">Spread the fillets out, skin side down, on paper towels and place another towel over them, pressing well to sponge them dry. Sprinkle them with salt and pepper and place a thin slice of butter half the total length of the fillet on the lower (or thicker) half of each. Fold the slender half over and press gently. Butter the bottom and sides of a heavy <em>sauteuse</em> or low, wide earthenware casserole just large enough to hold the fillets without having to squeeze them in, sprinkle the bottom with half of the chopped herbs and place the folded fillets side by side on this bed. Pour in enough <em>fumet</em> to barely cover, sprinkle the surface lightly with salt and pepper (remembering that the <em>fumet</em> will be radically reduced, concentrating the saltiness) and the remaining chopped herbs, and press a round of generously buttered kitchen paper, cut to the dimensions of the cooking utensil, buttered side down, over the fillets. Everything up to this point, assuming the <em>fumet</em> to be cold, may be done an hour or so ahead of time, if desired.</p>

  <p class="indent">Place the casserole, covered, over a medium to high flame (with earthenware placed over an asbestos pad, the flame may be turned to maximum strength). As the liquid heats, check regularly, lifting the edge of the buttered paper, and, the instant the boil is reached, remove from the heat and leave, tightly covered, to poach for 7 or 8 minutes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Lift out the fillets, one by one, allowing them to drain well, and place them on a heated serving platter. Place another heated plate over them to keep them warm while finishing the sauce.</p>

  <p class="indent">Reduce the sauce (if earthenware has been used for poaching, the liquid will have to be transferred to a metal saucepan) over a high flame, stirring constantly. Once it acquires a light syrupy consistency, remove it from the heat and, with a small whisk, whip in the remaining butter (which has previously been cut into small pieces and allowed to soften) at 3 intervals, adding more as the preceding batch is absorbed. It is essential that the butter be <em>unsalted</em> or the sauce will be oversalted—nor can one “make do” by undersalting the <em>fumet</em> and the fillets, for the latter will then be undersalted. Pour the sauce over the fillets and serve <a id="page365"></a>immediately, accompanied by the stewed cucumbers in a separate dish. The sauce will be consistent and creamy in texture without feeling “thick.”</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c26-s99"><em><span class="color">Stewed Cucumbers</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Concombres à l’Etuvée</p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>chopped chervil</em> (<em>optional</em>)</p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Peel the cucumbers, cut them in 4 lengthwise, scrape out the seeds with a small spoon, and cut them into approximately 1-inch lengths. Each section may, for the sake of elegance, be pared into the form of a large olive, but the quality of the preparation is in no way altered by this refinement. Plunge them into generously salted boiling water for a minute, drain them and sponge them dry, gently, with paper towels. Season them and put them to cook in butter over a low flame for 7 or 8 minutes, tossing them from time to time (turning them around with a spoon risks damaging them). An easy way to toss is to hold a lid over the sautéing pan with one hand while lifting the pan with the other and giving it an abrupt forward, upward and backward movement. The cucumbers should be only slightly yellowed by cooking and should remain slightly firm. Sprinkle with chervil and serve.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c26-s100"><em><span class="color">Spitted Roast Leg of Lamb</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Gigot d’Agneau Rôti à la Broche</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 leg of lamb</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 cloves garlic</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 teaspoon mixed herbs—thyme, rosemary, oregano, savory</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><a id="page366"></a><em>olive oil or melted butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">A good leg of lamb is proportionately short and well rounded. The fat is white and plentiful and the flesh a clear rose-tan color. Do not buy dark, brownish-red meat. To be properly served, lamb must be carved at table and, to be properly carved at table, it is essential that a section of the leg bone be left protruding (it should be sawed off just above the hock) and that the upper section be boned to the joint (which is to say that the pelvic bone must be removed). American butchers, unless their origins are Italian or French, refuse to understand this, and one must insist. An American “leg of lamb” usually consists of a piece from which the lower third of the leg has been removed and to which part of the saddle remains attached.</p>

  <p class="indent">Trim nearly all the fat from the leg. Peel the garlic cloves and slice them lengthwise into 3 or 4 sections each. Pierce the meat with the point of a small knife and insert garlic at either end next to the bone and at several points in the fleshier parts of the leg. Sprinkle with the herbs and rub the leg all over with the olive oil or melted butter. This may be done a couple of hours ahead of time and, if olive oil is used, the leg gains by “marinating” for a while.</p>

  <p class="indent">Grass, or yearling, lamb (baby milk-fed lamb must be well done) is never so exquisite as when roasted medium-rare (in France it is often roasted so rare that the flesh in the middle remains rubbery and cold; in America it is most often cooked until completely dried out and savorless) on a spit before a well-attended fruitwood fire. One may count approximately 15 minutes’ cooking time per pound, but it is impossible to be exact; meat which is too fresh takes longer to cook than meat which has been properly aged, and one fire, no matter how well attended, does not always have the same intensity as another. With a bit of experience, one can “feel” the right moment by pressing the surface of the meat between thumb and forefinger. When properly cooked, it is firm and resilient to the touch. For an average-sized leg of lamb, one may plan on an hour before an open fire (count 10 minutes less in an oven, starting it in a very hot oven that is turned down to medium the moment the roast is put in), during the last 10 minutes <a id="page367"></a>of which the turning of the spit should be stopped so that the thick, rounded section of the leg is left facing slightly downward toward the heart of the fire—baste regularly at this point. The roast should not be seasoned until well seared—about 15 minutes after being put to cook and after the actual cooking process, it should be always left in a warm place for a good 20 minutes to “relax.” During this period, the flesh becomes firmer and the heat contained in it continues to even out the cooking of the interior. In an oven, one may leave it with the oven turned off and the oven door left slightly ajar. Before an open fire, it may be unspitted and placed, covered, in the dripping pan near the fire, or transferred to the serving platter and removed to a warm oven.</p>

  <p class="indent">Prepare the fire in the fireplace a good hour before putting the roast to turn so that it will be blazing and a heart of coals will have formed. Nurse the outside edges to keep them flaming—there is always plenty of heat radiated from the center. Try to keep the logs in a vaguely semicircular form so that the heart of the fire is somewhat farther back than the outside parts. Construct a low wall of bricks, a strip of asbestos, etc., directly behind the dripping pan to protect it from the intense heat of the fire bed.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">CARVING AND SERVING</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">There are two basic ways to carve a leg of lamb: the English way (in which the lean side is carved on the slant and the fleshy side perpendicularly to the bone) and the French (everything, starting with the fleshy side, carved at a slant). In any case, a screw-on handle (<em>manche à gigot</em>—see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf3_r1.htm#prf3.12">Kitchen Equipment</a>) is essential. The carving knife must be razor-sharp. Screw the handle tightly onto the leg bone and, holding it firmly in hand with the other end of the leg resting on the serving platter, slice, almost flat (at a sharply acute angle to the bone), away from your person. When as many slices as there are guests have been produced, bring the knife back to the shank and, slicing slightly upward and still away from you, cut off as many slices as before (this section, distinctly different in flavor, is, because of its small size, always well done, but thanks to its gelatinous content it remains moist and succulent—in France it is affectionately known <a id="page368"></a>as <em>la souris</em>, “the mouse”). A great deal of juice will exude from the roast during the carving process. It is finest pure and unadorned, and should be served, a tablespoonful to each guest, over the meat. Return the serving platter to a warm oven in case second servings should be desired. Pass the green beans (below) the moment the roast has been served out.</p>

  <p class="center3">Haricots Verts au Beurre</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 pounds tiny, freshly picked green beans</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ pound butter</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">The same general remarks hold as for the green bean salad on <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c31_r1.htm#page412">this page</a>. The beans should be snapped at the ends, left whole, and cooked in the largest possible quantity of well-salted, rapidly boiling water until just done—around 8 minutes if they are small and fresh, as they should be. Before being buttered, they should be well drained (but not allowed to cool), returned to their cooking utensil, or to another large saucepan, and tossed (the pan should be held over the flame and the beans tossed constantly to avoid any possibility of sticking or scorching) over a high flame until their superficial moisture has completely disappeared. The butter should be cut into small pieces, and must not be added until the beans have been removed from the flame. Continue tossing and swirling the pan until all the butter has been absorbed. This is absolutely the only way to bind a boiled vegetable such as beans, peas, broad beans or cauliflower. In France, the vegetable is most often merely sautéed with the butter—that is to say, fried. The result is visually unattractive, bitter in flavor, and distinctly “unbound.” In America, the butter is added in minuscule quantity to the undried vegetable, the result being a puddle of thin broth with a few globules of grease floating on top.</p>

  <p class="center3">Pêche Melba</p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Vanilla ice cream:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 cups milk</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ vanilla bean (or something less than 1 teaspoon of extract)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 egg yolk</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup sugar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup whipping cream</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 quart fresh raspberries, passed through a nylon drum sieve and sugared to taste</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>slivered fresh almonds</em> (<em>optional</em>)</p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">The <em>pêche Melba</em> of worldwide fame is a scoop of ice cream with the half of a commercially canned peach on top, a spoonful of currant jelly on top of that, and a mound of frothy material shot from a gasbomb apparatus topping the whole thing off. Each food, although of a different texture, has the same flavor—that of the chemical laboratory. The dessert created by Escoffier to honor the singer Nellie Melba depends on three things only for it to rank among the finest of classical French desserts: the honesty of the ice cream, flavorful peaches that have been freshly poached in a syrup containing only water and sugar, and a sauce that is nothing but a purée of fresh raspberries. The best whipped cream in the world only detracts. The only acceptable refinement is the sprinkling of a few sliced fresh almonds over the surface.</p>

  <p class="indent">The following ice-cream recipe is only a suggestion, for all vanilla ice-cream recipes are good, provided that the ice cream is made of fresh milk, fresh eggs and fresh cream. The relative richness in egg yolks or cream, whether the basic “cream” is cooked beforehand or the whole thing is frozen raw in the form of a beaten-up eggnog, are all a question of taste, and not quality.</p>

  <p class="center"><a id="page370"></a><span class="small">THE VANILLA ICE CREAM</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Bring the milk to a boil with the vanilla bean (or flavor the hot milk with the extract), remove from the flame and allow it to infuse for about 10 minutes (or simply cool slightly if extract is used). Stir the egg yolk and the sugar together and beat until the yellow lightens in color, then slowly pour in the milk, stirring all the time. Place the saucepan over a low to medium flame and stir constantly with a wooden spoon, making certain to reach all corners of the saucepan, until the “cream” starts to take on a certain consistency (until it lightly coats the spoon). Above all, it must not be allowed to boil. Immerse the saucepan halfway in a basin of cold water, stirring the contents from time to time, and, when completely cooled, whip the cream until fairly firm and frothy, but not stiff, and stir it in. Freeze.</p>

  <p class="indent">There is no perfect replacement for the old-fashioned hand-turned ice-cream freezer, but the small electrical apparatuses meant to be installed in the freezing compartment of a refrigerator produce respectable results with a minimum of effort. There are also electrical freezers, of the same form as the old-fashioned variety, which freeze by means of cracked ice and coarse salt; still, the movement is not the same. The old method was not that difficult—perhaps we should return to it.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE PEACHES</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Peel the peaches (if the skins resist, dip them for a moment in boiling water). In this age of huge, perfectly formed, beautiful and tasteless fruit, it is perhaps best to taste a tiny slice of each before accepting it for use. Put them into a boiling sugar-and-water syrup, sweetened to taste (1 cup of sugar to 3 cups of water is about right) and allow them to poach, covered, at a bare simmer for 5 or 6 minutes. Leave them to cool in the syrup.</p>

  <p class="indent">Heap the ice cream in the center of a chilled, deep serving dish (crystal offers the prettiest presentation), surround it with the peaches (cut in half and pitted) and coat lightly with raspberry purée. Sprinkle <a id="page371"></a>the surface with peeled, sliced fresh almonds, if available, and send the rest of the sauce to the table in a sauceboat.</p>

  <p class="extract1"><span class="small">NOTE</span>: If fresh peaches and raspberries are out of season, home-canned peaches are respectable and wholesome in taste, and frozen raspberries still recall the flavor of the fresh.</p>
