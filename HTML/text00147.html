 CARAWAY PITTA CHIPS WITH BEETROOT &amp; FETA DIP</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_pink" id="nad0000949">
<em>I love nothing better than opening a packet and pouring out the contents into the biggest bowl I can find. I think we all have times when we want to do as little as possible. But we also all have times when we want to show off, and this recipe is for those extra-effort days. It’s a simple method, but really delivers on colour and flavour, combining aromatic pitta chips with a deliciously easy beetroot dip.</em>

<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 For the pitta chips, begin by toasting the caraway seeds lightly in a non-stick pan, being careful not to burn them as this will make them bitter. As soon as you hear a few sounds of popping, take them off the heat and crush them to a fine powder, using a pestle and mortar or a spice grinder.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000965">
<span class="pink">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Put the olive oil into a bowl. Stir in the crushed caraway seeds.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000966">
<span class="pink">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Preheat the oven to 180°C/160°C fan/gas 4. Have a large baking tray ready.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000967">
<span class="pink">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Using a small sharp knife, separate each pitta to make 2 ovals. Now slice the ovals into wedges or strips (I like strips). Brush the strips with the oily spice mix and place on the baking tray, making sure there is not too much overlap. If you find that there is, use a second tray or bake them in batches. Sprinkle with salt.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000968">
<span class="pink">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Bake in the oven for 18–20 minutes, until the chips are a light golden brown and crisp. Keep an eye on them, as they may cook slightly quicker.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000969">
<span class="pink">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Take them out of the oven and leave to cool. Once cooled they can be stored in an airtight container for few weeks. But set aside if you are using them the same day.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000970">

</span>
 Meanwhile, to make the dip, put the beetroot into a food processor, along with the oil, salt, garlic and a squeeze of lemon juice, and blitz to a smooth paste.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000971">
<span class="pink">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 Transfer the dip to a serving bowl and crumble on some feta before serving. I like to drizzle it with a little bit more olive oil, too. Serve with the pitta chips.</p>
