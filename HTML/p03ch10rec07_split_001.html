<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">As most of the pork we buy these days is from pigs that have been bred to put on lean meat, it is usually dry and tasteless because it is the fat that carries taste and succulence. With pork belly, the crisp crackling and layers of fat keep the meat meltingly succulent as it cooks. You can cut away the fat after it is cooked if you like. Make sure that the butcher has removed the ribs and that he has scored the rind with deep cuts that go right down to the fat. In Asturias, they serve pork with applesauce or roasted whole apples. Golden Delicious are a good substitute for their Reinetas. They also serve it with the chestnut puree (page 408) or mashed potatoes (page 281).</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6 TO 8</span></p>
<p class="qun">½ pork belly (about 4 pounds) with rind</p>
<p class="qun">1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">8 Golden Delicious apples</p>
<p class="qun">1 cup hard cider</p>
<p class="qun1">Chestnut puree (recipe follows)</p>
<p class="recsum">Put the pork belly on a rack in a roasting pan (if you don’t have a rack, grease the pan with 1 tablespoon olive oil). Sprinkle the belly with salt, rubbing it into the cuts in the rind. Then wipe the rind with paper towels and rub it and the flesh side with 1 tablespoon oil. Turn the belly rind side up.</p>
<p class="summary">Roast in a preheated 425°F oven for 30 minutes, until the rind has started to puff up. Reduce the heat to 375°F and cook for about 2 hours, until the crackling is crisp and brown.</p>
<p class="summary">Meanwhile, put the apples in a baking dish that holds them snugly and pour the cider into the bottom. When you have lowered the oven heat, place the dish of apples on the rack below the roast and cook until they are tender when pierced with a knife. The time depends on the apples’ size and degree of ripeness. Start checking them after about 40 minutes. Then put the apples back in the oven when the pork belly is almost done and heat through.</p>
<p class="summary">Let the belly rest for 15 minutes, covered with foil, before cutting it into thick slices. Serve with the chestnut puree.</p>
