<p id="sab0003231" class="calibre10"><em class="calibre9">Sabor</em> means ‘flavour’ in Spanish, and, above everything, flavour is what defines the food I make. I’m from the Basque country and I love Basque cuisine but I also love travelling around Spain. My food, and by extension the recipes in this book, is inspired by growing up in Santurtzi, but also by my experiences travelling and working in London for more than eighteen years. The combination of ingredients and flavours that I use is the way I try to express these experiences. It’s not fusion, but I might mix a traditional Basque recipe with flavours from Galicia and Catalonia – and it works. Conversely, it was moving to another country that made me want to go back to my roots, to really travel around my country and learn more about it, and to be able to transmit its richness and diversity to the people who eat and cook my food. I’ll never know, but if I’d stayed in Bilbao I might only be cooking Basque food.</p>
<p id="sab0003232" class="calibre10">Unsurprisingly, I’m not precious about tradition. The more you travel and the more you taste, the more you discover all the different possibilities there are to cooking. There’s never only one way to make something, and no one method is better than another. It might sound obvious, but if I could give one piece of advice about cooking, <a id="pg14" class="pcalibre calibre3"></a>it would be to be flexible and to cook with what you want to eat. If this means leaving out an ingredient or adding another one, that’s fine. People are familiar with classics like tortilla or ham <em class="calibre9">croquetas</em>, but I make chorizo tortilla and prawn <em class="calibre9">croquetas</em>. For me, it’s all about taking one base thing, whether that’s béchamel or <em class="calibre9">alioli</em>, and expanding it and making it exciting by adding something new.</p>
<p id="sab0003233" class="calibre10">This might also involve using new ingredients like root vegetables (until recently, you wouldn’t see Jerusalem artichokes on Spanish menus, but I love to use them), or it might be about thinking of how to bring Spanish flavours to things that are not traditionally Spanish, like cockles, or skate. My attitude is that as long as what you make is delicious you can have fun finding your own way there. This is at the heart of my food: classic Spanish recipes with fresh flavours.</p>
<p id="sab0003234" class="calibre10">Most of the recipes in this book are for 4–6 people. That’s partly because they work well for these quantities, but it’s also because the kind of food I love to cook is sociable. Rather than being individually plated, it works best served on platters, so that everybody can get stuck in and help themselves. For me, it’s a happy, interactive way of eating, people saying, ‘Pass me this’ or ‘Pass me that’ – you have to get involved. Of course, cooking for 4–6 might not be practical for everyone, and if you want to make a recipe for two you can just halve the quantities in most cases (two exceptions are the <em class="calibre9">romesco</em> <a href="part0030.html#pg56" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a> and the <em class="calibre9">alioli</em> <a href="part0216.html#pg287" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>, where you need to make enough for the food processor to work).</p>
<p id="sab0003235" class="calibre10">Cooking is so strange: what I’m cooking today and what I cooked yesterday can turn out so differently. The first thing I ever cooked was a roast chicken (see <a href="part0155.html#pg212" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>): it was crisp-skinned and juicy and perfect: my dad couldn’t believe it. The next time I made it, a few weeks later, it didn’t turn out right. That was a valuable lesson. Cooking isn’t a mechanical process: it’s about instinct and confidence and learning what something should smell, feel and taste like. Recipe writing is imprecise and difficult to communicate. When you’re cooking there can be so many variables. Your ingredients are one: whether it’s the size of your red pepper, the thickness of your fillet of fish or the fattiness of your piece of meat. Your tools are another: how hot your oven is (which will affect how long you cook things for), or the size of your pan (which will affect how <a id="pg15" class="pcalibre calibre3"></a>much oil you need to use, or how long something takes to simmer). Time is another variable: whether you cook your diced onions and vegetables for 10 or 12 minutes is less important than whether you cook them to the stage where they are soft and almost collapsing – this is what will give an extra sweetness and depth of flavour to your stew that will make it really special. Admittedly, desserts are different, as they do generally require precision, and 200ml of double cream is always 200ml of double cream. All I can say is that, as with my roast chicken, the best way to learn is through your mistakes – they are what will teach you to become a better cook.</p>
<p id="sab0003236" class="calibre10">Spanish cooking – and my cooking – isn’t just about learning new techniques but it is all about ingredients and products and making the very best of everything that you use. It’s about not covering flavours, but letting them speak for themselves.</p>
