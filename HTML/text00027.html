</h1>
<p class="pf">Vesala was always an old man to us as kids, although in reality he was only in his forties or fifties at the time. He lived on a homestead adjoining our farm. It wasn’t until I was much older that I came to know he even had a first name. It was the custom of Finns to call each other by their last name. So, Jussi (John) Vesala was always just “Vesala” to us.</p>
<p>Vesala had the reputation of being a stingy old miser who mistrusted the banks and kept his money in jars buried in his field. When he needed help—as he often did—he would hire my younger brothers, and he paid them well, peeling off paper bills from musty rolls of dollars he unearthed from his secret places in the field. They would run home and laugh and cheer as they passed the money around for everyone to smell.</p>
<p>Vesala had two horses that he used for his fieldwork, and he grew award-winning oats and potatoes. On quiet summer days we could hear him singing to his horses in low, mournful notes.</p>
<p>Although many would have called him a little strange, Mummy always welcomed him into the house when he appeared at the door. He never knocked to announce his arrival, but we could smell him. Salty, sweaty, reeking of wood smoke and burned coffee, he seemed to leave his stench everywhere. However, a more loyal neighbor could never be found. Whenever we needed help he was there.</p>
<p>When I was sixteen years old, Mummy and Isä decided to take a trip “out west” to visit my aunt Elma and uncle Mal. I was left to take care of the farm and the “little kids,” and Vesala came in the evening to help feed and milk the cows. At that point I was perfectly capable of doing the chores, but it was a comfort to have him there.</p>
<p>When Vesala came to visit, he just walked in and sat down at the table. We would always try to see how many pieces of buttered korppua (dry toast or zwieback) or cinnamon rolls he could eat. We piled them as high as we could on a plate, and he always finished off all of them—along with mugs of coffee sweetened and mixed with milk.</p>
<p>In the fall, Vesala would often buy a dozen eggs from Mummy. He insisted on paying for them, as he was too proud to accept them for free. One spring he came over to complain to Mummy that one of the eggs was rotten. That was not a surprise to her, as he had no refrigerator and he had had the eggs a good six months! She immediately replaced the egg with a fresh one.</p>
<p>There were so many funny moments with Vesala. One time when he came to visit, we were looking at the Montgomery Ward catalog. Mummy jested to him that “look, you could order yourself a really good-looking wife,” pointing at dress models. Vesala hemmed and hawed, he looked up at the ceiling and at the walls, scratched his head, and finally replied in Finnish: “If I got a wife, then I’d have to get a cow, too.”</p>
<p>Another time, Vesala walked the four miles into Floodwood to buy his bread and ring bologna at the Co-op store. I happened to be working at the store when he toddled in with two backpacks. When I offered to put his groceries into one of the packs, he said, “No, not that one. It has lice in it.”</p>
<p>One summer, Vesala came over to announce that he was leaving America and going back to his native Finland, to the farm called Vesala from which he got his name. Mummy offered to help him wash his clothes for the trip and pack his suitcase. He arrived a day or so later with a gunnysack stuffed with the clothes he wanted to take along. Mummy washed and ironed them, and even offered him a cap that Isä had discarded because he had a new one. He took his sweat-encrusted cap and pitched it over the fence as he accepted his welcome gift. He left Duluth with his clean clothes packed in a Northrup King gunnysack slung over his shoulder.</p>
<p>As it turned out, Vesala found his home farm, but nobody he knew lived there anymore and all his relatives were gone. The owners gave him a sauna and a bunk in one of the outbuildings, where he could live while he worked on the farm as a hired hand.</p>
<p>He called my mother and said he wanted to come back to Minnesota because there was nobody in Finland whom he knew anymore. But he was not allowed to come back to the United States, as he had never taken out citizenship and was now “too old” to be allowed back into the country.</p>
<p>Dick and I happened to be in Helsinki at the time when he told us this story. He had carried his life savings in his overall pockets, wrapped in rolls like he did when he buried them in his field. He asked us to find him the cheapest room we could in Helsinki, and when he pulled out his thick roll of one-hundred-dollar bills, the eyes of the manager of the “YMCA” popped out and he warned Vesala to be very careful!</p>
<p>The last time we saw this independent old man he was toddling across the busiest intersection of trams in Helsinki. He died of natural causes somewhere in the city.</p>
