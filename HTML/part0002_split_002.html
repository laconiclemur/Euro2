			<p class="rec-intro">At first glance, this recipe might appear daunting but there is nothing very difficult and the result is so delicious it is well worth the effort. It does make a large amount but the boudin freezes well. A good butcher will be able to supply the pig’s head and blood and most Italian delis stock lardo. If using sausage casings, buy the large size. I recommend the crispy pork skin too, which goes perfectly with the boudin.</p>

			<p class="body">To cook the lardo, wrap it in foil and bake at the lowest possible setting in your oven for 1½ hours. Leave to cool, then chill and dice. Cut the cooked pig’s head and tongues into 1–2cm dice – use everything, the ears, skin, the lot – then mix it all with the diced lardo in a large bowl. Melt the duck fat in a frying pan and gently cook the diced onions until very soft and thoroughly cooked. Add them to the meat and lardo, mix in the pig’s blood, spices, 2 teaspoons of salt and the cream, then the herbs, egg whites and vinegar. </p>
			<p class="body">You can cook the boudin in terrines or in natural sausage casings. If using terrines, you’ll need about 4, each measuring about 23 x 9cm. Grease them well, then spoon in the mixture and cover with greased paper and foil. Place them in a roasting tin, pour in boiling water to come about halfway up the sides, then bake in a cool oven, at 120°C/Fan 100°C/Gas ½ for 2 hours or until set. Leave to cool, then chill until needed. If using casings, roll the mixture into large sausages, about 6cm in diameter. Tie a knot in one end of each casing, fill them and tie securely. Bring a pan of salted water to a gentle simmer and poach the boudins for about an hour. </p>
			<p class="body">To serve, slice the boudin, dust with flour and pan-fry in a little olive oil. Serve with spicy tomato chutney (see <a href="part0010_split_029.html#spicy-tomato-chutney">here</a>) and crispy pork skin.</p>
			<p class="alt-head">Crispy pork skin</p>
			<p class="body">Make lots of holes all over the skin with a fork, then sprinkle with lots of salt and set aside for an hour. Put the skin in a large pan of water, bring to the boil, then simmer for a couple of hours until the skin is tender and can be pierced easily with a knife. Remove it and when cool enough to handle, lay it between 2 sheets of greaseproof paper on a baking tray. Put another tray on top to keep it flat and bake at 160°C/Fan 140°C/Gas 3 for about 45 minutes until crisp. Break the skin into pieces and store in an airtight container.</p>
