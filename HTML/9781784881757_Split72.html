<h1 class="chapter">cheese &amp; mixed seed cantuccini</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>These rustic and incredibly moreish biscuits are wonderful on their own as a snack, spread with ricotta or cream cheese and topped with halved cherry tomatoes and basil leaves to go with drinks, or served warm with a bowl of hot soup. They keep for a week or so in an airtight container so have them on standby during the festive season.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">MAKES APPROX. 35 CANTUCCINI</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>olive oil, for greasing</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>125 g (4 oz/1 cup) ‘00’, plain (all-purpose) or gluten-free flour, plus 1 tablespoon to coat the loaves</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>50 g (2 oz) grated Parmesan</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>75 g (2½ oz) Gorgonzola Dolce, including the rind</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>100 g (3½ oz) salted butter</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>75 g (2½ oz/scant ¾ cup) ground almonds (almond meal)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 teaspoon baking powder</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 egg, plus 1 egg yolk</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>pinch of salt</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>pinch of freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>35 g (1¼ oz) mixed seeds, such as pumpkin, sunflower and sesame</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>15 g (½ oz) black onion seeds</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>25 g (1 oz) walnuts</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 tablespoon pink peppercorns</b></p>
<p class="tx3"><b>TO SERVE</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>cream cheese</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>basil leaves</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>cherry tomatoes, halved</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Preheat the oven to 170°C (340°F/Gas 3) and lightly grease a baking tray with oil. Put the flour, cheeses, butter, ground almonds, baking powder, egg, egg yolk and seasoning in a food processor and blitz until well combined. Add the seeds, walnuts and peppercorns, and give the mixture a quick blitz to combine and roughly chop them. The mixture doesn’t need to be completely smooth – it is good to have a little texture from the nuts.</p>
<p class="tx">Divide the dough in half and roll each piece into a long sausage around 25 × 5 cm (10 × 2 in). Put them on the greased baking tray and lightly flatten them so that they look like a slightly squashed salami. Bake for 20–25 minutes or until just golden. Remove from the oven and set aside to rest for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="tx">Use a cake slice to move the rolls to a chopping board and cut them at a diagonal angle into 1 cm- (½ in-) thick slices. Move these back onto the tray – they can be standing upright and spaced apart or lying down – and bake again for 15–20 minutes or until they are firm to the touch and lightly browned.</p>
<p class="tx">Remove from the oven and allow to cool. They will keep in an airtight container for up to 1 week. Serve topped with cream cheese, fresh basil and half a cherry tomato.</p>
