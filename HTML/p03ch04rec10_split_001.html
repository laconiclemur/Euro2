</div>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">This is a Castilian version of a thick soup that is eaten in many parts of Spain during Lent, when it is known as</span> garbanzos de vigilia <span class="italic">(meaning “chickpeas of abstinence”). During Lent, bits of salt cod are sometimes added; at other times, bits of ham or bacon may go in. It is delicious and satisfying, with a rich texture and an intriguing flavor that comes from the mashed paste of fried bread, garlic, and spices that is stirred in at the end. It is a complex dish, but not a difficult one.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">These days supermarkets usually sell baby spinach with very thin stems. If you buy spinach at a farmers’ market, you will need to pull off the tough stems and wash the leaves carefully.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">3 medium waxy potatoes, peeled and cut into quarters</p>
<p class="qun">Two 14-ounce cans of chickpeas, drained</p>
<p class="qun">5½ cups vegetable or chicken stock (or 5½ cups water plus 1 bouillon cube)</p>
<p class="qun">1 pound fresh spinach or frozen spinach, defrosted</p>
<p class="qun">1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">2 hard-boiled eggs</p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">4 to 5 garlic cloves</p>
<p class="qun">2 slices bread, crusts removed</p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon <span class="italic">pimentón dulce</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon ground cumin</p>
<p class="qun1">Pinch of pure ground chile powder</p>
<p class="recsum">Put the potatoes and chickpeas in a large saucepan with about 4 cups of the stock and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes. Add the fresh or frozen spinach and cook, covered, for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Add the vinegar and some salt and cook for 10 minutes more.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Meanwhile, remove the hard-boiled egg yolks and reserve them. Chop the egg whites and reserve them.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Heat the oil in a small skillet and fry the garlic cloves and bread over medium-high heat, turning them, until golden brown. Watch closely, as they will brown quickly. Drain on paper towels.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Put the garlic and bread in a food processor, add the <span class="italic">pimentón dulce,</span> cumin, and chile powder, and blend to a fine paste. Add the hard-boiled egg yolks and blend well. Gradually pour in the remaining stock and blend to a thin cream.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Pour this garlic mixture into the soup, stir well, and check the seasoning. Cook for another 10 minutes, then stir in the egg whites. Add some water if necessary to thin the soup a little—but it is meant to be thick.</p>
