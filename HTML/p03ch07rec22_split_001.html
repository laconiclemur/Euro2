<p class="summary"><span class="italic">This recipe was inspired by one in</span> Tía Victoria’s Spanish Kitchen <span class="italic">by Victoria Serra, translated by Elizabeth Gili. It was lent to me by Elizabeth, a beautiful blue-eyed lady in her nineties. Her husband, Joan Gili, a Catalan, had come to London in 1933. He ran a Hispanic bookshop in Cecil Court off St. Martin’s Lane and translated several of García Lorca’s books with Stephen Spender. He also started the Anglo-Catalan Society. Nostalgic for his family cooking, he wrote to his mother for recipes and eventually encouraged her to write a book that was published in Spain as</span> Sapores <span class="italic">by his father, the publisher Luis Gili.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">I used frozen artichoke bottoms. If you want to use fresh artichokes, see page 129 for how to prepare them.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4</span></p>
<p class="qun">8 fresh artichoke hearts or bottoms (see page 129) or frozen ones, defrosted</p>
<p class="qun">½ slice white bread, crusts removed</p>
<p class="qun">1 to 2 large garlic cloves</p>
<p class="qun">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">1 tablespoon white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="qun">½ to ¾ cup chopped flat-leaf parsley</p>
<p class="qun">3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="qun1">Salt</p>
<p class="recsum">Cook the artichokes in boiling salted water until just tender. Drain and let cool.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Fry the bread and garlic cloves in olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat, turning to brown them lightly all over. Drain on paper towels.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Pour the vinegar over the fried bread, then blend with the garlic in the food processor. Add the parsley, extra virgin olive oil, and some salt and blend to a creamy sauce.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Serve the artichokes at room temperature, spreading a little of the sauce over each one.</p>
