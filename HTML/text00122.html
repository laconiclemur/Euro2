 WHOLE BAKED FISH WITH POTATOES, LEMON &amp; SUN-DRIED TOMATOES</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_lavd" id="nad0000441">
<em>I grew up eating a lot of fish, as it’s a staple of any Bangladeshi home. My mother would use all kinds of exotic fish that were cooked and preserved in various complicated ways before even making it into the stewing pot. But my travels round Britain have shown me fish in a different light, and I’ve discovered much simpler and far quicker ways of cooking it. It’s given me a whole new appreciation of its sweet and subtle flavours. This recipe looks and sounds impressive, but is actually very straightforward, with the whole fish baked gently on a bed of potatoes and sun-dried tomatoes. The addition of sliced lemons and sugar adds loads of delicious flavour to the flesh and juices.</em>

<strong>1.</strong>

 Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6 and line a large baking dish or roasting tin with baking paper.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000453">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Boil the potatoes in salted water for 10 minutes or until just becoming tender. Drain, then slice them lengthways into about <span class="frac_method" lang="ar-SA" xml:lang="ar-SA">½</span>
 cm thick slices. Place them in the lined dish or tin and mix in the sliced lemon and the onion seeds.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000454">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Remove the sun-dried tomatoes from their oil, reserving the oil, and roughly chop. Mix the tomatoes into the potatoes, along with 3 tablespoons of the reserved oil. Season with salt and pepper and mix in the sugar.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000455">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Season the fish inside and out and place half the herbs inside each one. (If using Dover sole, lay the herbs between the fish and the potatoes.) Place the fish on top of the potatoes and drizzle over a couple of tablespoons of the remaining sun-dried tomato oil.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000456">
<span class="lavd">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Bake for 25–30 minutes, or until the fish is just cooked through and the potatoes are crisping up. Remove from the oven, and serve.</p>
