<p class="summary"><span class="bi">I recognized Pepe at the Oviedo airport from the cartoons on his website, which</span> show a round figure with a wide smile emerging from a casserole with a pen and notebook, and the same figure forming out of the vapors from a bottle of wine, like the genie that appeared from Aladdin’s magic lamp. Pepe’s full name is José Juan Iglesias del Castillo y Díaz de la Serna. I was with Jane Kramer, who was writing about me for <span class="italic">The New Yorker</span>. We had decided only days before to go to Asturias, and a couple of telephone calls to friends led me to Pepe, the “ambassador” of Asturian gastronomy.</p>
<p class="summary">Pepe drove us through the rugged mountains, along the fast-flowing rivers and woodlands of the fantastically beautiful Picos de Europa. We stopped at little shepherds’ villages, where we saw sheep and goats and tasted the strong cave-ripened blue cheese, Cabrales, and drank the local still hard cider. We visited the sanctuary of Covadonga in Cangas de Onis, where, according to legend, the Virgin Mary appeared to the chief Pelayo and helped him to fight off the Muslim armies. Pepe gave us a running commentary on the Roman, Gothic, Baroque, and pre-Romanesque architecture of the region, and we ate in restaurants where the chefs did their own exquisite take on local dishes.</p>
<p class="summary">Pepe was born and raised in Madrid, among the pots and pans of his parents’ restaurant, El Horno de Santa Teresa. When they died in a tragic accident in 1976, he abandoned his veterinary studies to take over the restaurant. In 1990, he retired to a more peaceful life on the beach of Salinas near Avilés in Asturias, where he shares a house with his doctor wife, María, and became a restaurant critic and food and wine writer. People are always sending me recipes they have cut out from Spanish magazines and newspapers that turn out to be his. He has written twenty books, including <span class="italic">Comer con Vino</span> (<span class="italic">Eating with Wine</span>), about matching food with wine. He is famous for his virtual <span class="italic">Enciclopedia de Gastronomía,</span> where he offers recipes and articles and chats about food and wine.</p>
