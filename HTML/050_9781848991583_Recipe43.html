<h5 class="h5"><a id="pageid_67"/><b>Cocoa-infused French Toast</b> <span class="smfont">with</span> <b>Roasted Peaches</b></h5>
<p class="normal"><b>My mom often made pain perdu, as we knew French toast, for me when I was growing up. It was seen as a sin to throw bread away, so any leftover bread was sliced and dipped into egg and milk and fried in butter. In this new version, the cocoa transforms this classic dish to create a stylish, modern dessert with the added elegance of roasted peaches. You can also adapt this dish and serve it with pears, apricots or plums instead of peaches, if you like, or even make it with coconut milk instead of cow milk.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 10 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 25 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">5 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 large, firm peaches, quartered and pits removed</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 tablespoons maple syrup</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons unsweetened dark cocoa powder</p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons whole milk, slightly warm</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 eggs, lightly beaten</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 x 1-inch slices pain de campagne or other country-style bread</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons slivered almonds, toasted</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 tablespoons crème fraîche</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 teaspoon chopped rosemary leaves</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Heat the oven to 350°F. Melt half the butter an ovenproof sauté pan over medium heat. When it is foaming, add the peaches and sauté 2 to 3 minutes, turning them once, until they are golden on both sides. Add 2 tablespoons of the maple syrup and turn the peaches to coat them in the syrup, then transfer them to the oven and roast 5 to 8 minutes until they are just soft. Remove the pan from the heat and leave the peaches to one side on a plate. Leave the oven on.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Mix half the cocoa powder with the warm milk, eggs and sugar in a wide, shallow bowl, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Leave to cool slightly, if necessary. Add 2 slices of the bread and soak both sides. Put the bread on a clean dish towel to drain slightly, then repeat with the remaining slices of bread.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Heat a large, nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the remaining butter and maple syrup and, when they melt, swirl the pan until they are combined. Put the egg-soaked bread slices in the pan and fry 1 to 2 minutes on each side until they are just golden and slightly crisp, taking care they do not burn. You might need to do this in batches.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Put the French toast in a shallow baking sheet and top with the roasted peaches, a sprinkling of toasted almonds and a dusting of the remaining cocoa powder. Heat through in the oven 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> Meanwhile, mix together the crème fraîche and rosemary. Serve the French toast and peaches with the rosemary-flavored crème fraîche.</p>
