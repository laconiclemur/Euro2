<p class="author1"><span class="txit">torta fregolotta</span></p>
<p class="noindentb"><span class="txit">Fregolotta,</span> or crumbly cake, is typically served in the autumn during the first pressing of the grapes. The cake is placed in the center of the table and each person is poured a glass of <span class="txit">novella,</span> or new wine, which is comparable to the French Beaujolais nouveau. Small pieces of the cake are broken off and neatly dipped into the wine before eating. You may serve this dessert with any sweet wine or with a steaming cup of espresso. The batter for this cake is very dry and loose. It may look strange, but don’t worry—it will come together in the heat of the oven and turn out just fine.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> In a large bowl, toss together the almonds, cornmeal, sugar, and cake flour. Make a well in the center of these dry ingredients and add the egg yolks, vanilla, and lemon and orange zests. Use a fork to incorporate the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. With your hands, rub the butter into the dry mixture to form a crumbly dough.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Shake the dough out onto the prepared baking sheet, spreading to distribute it evenly. Pat it down. Bake until golden brown and firm, about 25 minutes. Allow to cool, and serve. Or break into small pieces and store in an airtight container for up to 1 week.</p>
