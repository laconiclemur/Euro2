<p class="noindentb">The idea of wilting bitter greens—such as escarole, spinach, and broccoli rabe—has long been a part of Italian cooking. To reduce the bitter taste of wilted watercress, Gianni pairs it with shrimp, which has a naturally sweet flavor.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling if desired</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup chopped shallots</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> pound medium-size shrimp, shelled, deveined, and cut in half lengthwise</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups thinly sliced white mushroom caps</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">3</sub> cup dry white wine</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup chicken broth</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 ounces watercress (about 2 bunches), tough stems removed</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 ripe plum tomato, diced</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon butter</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Warm the olive oil in a skillet set over high heat. Add the parsley and shallots and cook, stirring constantly, to wilt the shallots, about 2 minutes. Add the shrimp and cook, stirring frequently until the shrimp just begin to turn pink, about 2 minutes. Stir in the mushrooms, and season with salt and pepper. Cook until the shrimp are cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the wine, broth, and watercress. Cook, tossing the watercress until wilted, about half a minute. Remove from the heat.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Use tongs to remove the watercress from the skillet and distribute it evenly among four shallow bowls. Top with the shrimp. Return the skillet to the heat, and stir the tomato and butter into the remaining liquid. Cook, stirring frequently, to melt the butter and slightly thicken the sauce, about 2 minutes. Distribute the sauce evenly among the serving bowls. Serve immediately, drizzled with additional extra virgin olive oil if you like.</p>
