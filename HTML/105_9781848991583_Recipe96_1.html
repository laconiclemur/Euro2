<p class="normal"><b>What is ceviche? It is originally a Spanish word, and is a great specialty of Peru, as well as Ecuador and Chile. It is basically raw fish or shellfish marinated in plenty of citrus juice, fresh herbs, onions, shallot and other flavorings. When you use shellfish, make sure they are fresh or freshly frozen—trust your fish merchant, because he or she will have the expertise you need. You’ll see that I use garlic here, just enough to bring a little accent to the dish. Enjoy your ceviche served with mango, perhaps, or an avocado, sweet potato and red onion salad with flat-leaf parsley. I use Chardonnay vinegar in many recipes, such as this one, in preference to ordinary white wine vinegar, because it imparts a better flavor, so it is worth buying a bottle.</b></p>

<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Reserve 4 whole langoustines, then cut the rest into ½-inch chunks and put in a nonmetallic bowl. Add the whole langoustines, then add the lime zest and juice, chili, garlic, vinegar and a pinch of salt and gently fold everything together. Cover and leave to marinate in the refrigerator 2 to 3 hours.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Just before you are ready to serve, core the apples, then cut them into thin slices, form top to bottom, discarding the ends that are all skin. Stack the slices and cut through them to form thin matchsticks.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> When ready to serve, remove the bowl from the refrigerator and take out the whole langoustines, then add the tarragon and all but 1 tablespoon of the apple and fold together. Spoon the mixture into four glasses, then hang the whole langoustines on the edge of the glasses. Scatter the remaining apple over the top and serve immediately with mayonnaise flavored with your chosen spice or herb.</p>
