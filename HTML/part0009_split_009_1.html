  <h3 class="h3a">Pork in aspic jelly</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">Gelatine or aspic jelly was used in ancient Rome as a stiffening agent in the kitchen; in medieval times meat and fish gelatines were served at grand banquets. Gelatine, these days, is mostly used by producers of marshmallows and gummy sweets and is sold in thin leaves for home use when making jellies or panna cotta. But it is derived from the feet (and other parts) of pigs and calves. Until relatively recently in rural areas of Italy, nothing was wasted when a pig was killed, and parts like the trotter, ear, tail and even snout were used in dishes like this. We used to eat this dish when I was a boy in Italy; that’s why I have kept the title in Neapolitan dialect. Jellied pork is still popular in the Campania region and Sicily. It is very simple to prepare and most butchers will be happy to sell you the pig’s parts for a minimal cost.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 10–12</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 pig’s trotter</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 pig’s ear</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 pig’s tail</p>

  <p class="ing1">1kg/2lb 4oz mixed pork meat, such as chops, stewing chunks, neck</p>

  <p class="ing1">10 bay leaves, plus a few extra to garnish</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 tbsp salt</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 tbsp white wine vinegar</p>

  <p class="ing1">juice of ½ lemon</p>

  <p class="ing1">freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">30g/1oz pine kernels</p>

  <p class="ing2">30g/1oz sultanas (golden raisins)</p>

  <p class="para">First clean the pig’s trotter, ear and tail under cold running water, scrubbing well and ensuring all hairs and impurities are removed. Put the pieces in a large saucepan with the pork meat, 10 bay leaves and the salt and cover with cold water. Bring to the boil, skim off the scum, then reduce the heat, partially cover with a lid and gently simmer for 2¾ hours, removing any scum from time to time.</p>

  <p class="para">Add the vinegar and simmer for a further 15 minutes. Remove the pork meat and leave to cool. Discard the trotter, ear and tail. Strain the liquid through a fine sieve, add the lemon juice and set aside.</p>

  <p class="para1">Using your fingers, tear the cooled meat into pieces, discarding any fat. Put the pieces of meat in a large terrine, sprinkle with some black pepper, half the pine kernels and sultanas and three or four bay leaves. Pour over the liquid and leave in a cool place to set for about an hour, then scatter over the remaining pine kernels, sultanas and a couple more bay leaves. Cover with clingfilm (plastic wrap) and leave in a cool place overnight to set completely. If you are making this on a warm day, place in the fridge once set, otherwise leave at room temperature.</p>
