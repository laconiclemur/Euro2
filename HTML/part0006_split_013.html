			<p class="rec-intro">This is a very special dish, prepared over a time span of more than a week, but there is surprisingly little work involved and the flavour is amazing. The recipe does appear in my Gavroche cook book but it is a great favourite and one I wanted to include here. </p>

			<p class="body">Trim the lamb, remove the aitch bone and lightly score the skin – your butcher will do all this for you. Cut 12cm-long strips of pork back fat and use these to lard the lamb lengthways at least 6 times with a knife or a larding needle. </p>
			<p class="body">Mix all the marinade ingredients together, add the lamb and cover with cling film. Place in the fridge and leave to marinate for a week, turning the meat several times a day so it all absorbs the flavours.</p>
			<p class="body">Drain the lamb, reserving the liquid and the vegetables. Heat the butter and oil in a thick-based braising pan, add the lamb and cook over a medium-high heat until golden brown. Remove the lamb from the pan and if the fat is burned, discard it and use fresh butter to cook all the vegetables (including the marinade vegetables) until golden brown. Add the bacon, then deglaze the pan with the wine, port and marinade. Place the pan over a high heat and reduce the liquid by two thirds, then add the lamb, season well and cover with the veal stock. Bring to the boil and skim. Check the seasoning. Put a lid on the pan and place it in the oven at 140°C/Fan 120°/Gas 1 for approximately 7 hours! Keep an eye on it, though, as ovens vary and you may have to top up the liquid with some water occasionally. Also, the cooking time may vary depending on the age and quality of the lamb. The meat should be tender and nearly falling off the bone.</p>
			<p class="body">Take the lamb out of the oven and leave it to cool in the sauce. When the lamb is cold, remove it from the pan and strain the sauce through a fine sieve. Check for seasoning and consistency – reduce the sauce if necessary. Pour the sauce over the meat and leave it in the fridge overnight. </p>
			<p class="body">The next day when you’re ready to serve, reheat the meat gently in the sauce in a pan on the hob, while basting occasionally. Bring it to the table and serve with a spoon – don’t attempt to carve. Good with mashed potatoes.</p>
