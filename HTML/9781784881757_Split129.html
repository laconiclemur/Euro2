<p class="tx2"><b>You can use any type of potato for this. The cheese is an optional extra but we love it; I would perhaps leave it out if you are serving it with fish. This is a great side dish but also works well as a main course (or even a breakfast) to fill up hungry teenagers, with a couple of poached eggs on the side if you fancy.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 4–6 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>1.2 kg (2 lb 10 oz) new or roasting potatoes, left whole if small, or peeled and roughly chopped into 3 cm (1¼ in) cubes</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>25 g (1 oz) salted butter</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 large leek, trimmed and cut into half-moons around 1 cm (½ in) wide, or 1 bunch of spring onions (scallions), trimmed and roughly chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt and freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>25 g (1 oz) grated Parmesan or Pecorino (optional)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>small handful of parsley, roughly chopped, to serve</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Boil the potatoes in a large saucepan of salted water until tender. Depending on their size, they will take 15–20 minutes.</p>
<p class="tx">When the potatoes are done, drain and set aside. Heat the oil and butter in a large non-stick frying pan over a gentle heat. Add the leeks or spring onions and the potatoes, and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 10–15 minutes until the onions soften and the potatoes start to brown. Scatter over the cheese (if using) and continue to cook for a further 3–5 minutes, stirring the cheese into the potatoes. It will start to brown and catch in the pan (these browned bits are delicious). Tip the potato mixture into a warm serving dish, scatter with the parsley and serve.</p>
