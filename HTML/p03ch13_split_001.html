<p class="summary"><span class="bi">The usual way to end a meal in Spain is with fruit, sometimes followed by</span> store-bought ice creams or pastries. “Sweet dishes do exist in Spain, but more as vestiges of history. . . . The traditional man considers this kind of food to be a feminine weakness, while for women it is a disaster for the waistline,” is how Alicia Ríos introduces the chapter on desserts in <span class="italic">Heritage of Spanish Cooking,</span> the book she coauthored with Lourdes March. But Spaniards do eat the fritters called <span class="italic">churros</span> with hot chocolate for breakfast and for their <span class="italic">merienda</span> (teatime snack), and they buy <span class="italic">magdalenas</span> (madeleines) by the bagful from the supermarket.</p>
<p class="summary">A huge range of pastries, including deep-fried doughnuts, raisin and nut breads, and cakes based on almonds, hazelnuts, or walnuts are the “historic” festive foods that celebrate the landmarks of the Christian year—Christmas, the Epiphany, Easter, Ascension Day, the Feast of St. John the Baptist, St. Michael’s Day, St. Martin’s Day (and so on), and many feasts celebrating the Virgin Mary. Every village honors its own patron saint with parades and fireworks, reenactments of legends, and a special pastry. During the Festival of San Isidro, which lasts for three weeks in Madrid, with processions, music, dancing, and bullfights, bakeries and pastry shops go into a baking frenzy. The traditional pastries once attached to a special day are now made all year round. And many, known as convent sweets, are made by cloistered nuns.</p>
<p class="summary">I have a sweet tooth, so I went looking for those sweet dishes that are a “feminine weakness.” Every region has its specialties. In the north, which is dairy country, they make puddings, custards, rice puddings, and cheesecakes. The ubiquitous flan we know as crème caramel is everywhere in Spain. Some of the loveliest sweets are made with fruit. There are compotes, flans, tarts, cakes, fritters, and omelets. At an international dessert competition, you would be able to tell the Spanish entries, because they are almost always flavored with lemon peel and cinnamon.</p>
