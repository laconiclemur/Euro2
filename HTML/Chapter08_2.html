<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">M</span><small>Y FIRST SEASON</small> on <i>Top Chef</i> was brutal, although I loved being in the same cast as my friends Bryan and Michael Voltaggio. Some of those competitions and challenges were rough, I’m not gonna lie, and don’t even get me started on the Judges’ Table. Though it’s only a few minutes on TV, the whole Judges’ Table process can last up to 7 hours, and even when you know you cooked a great dish, it’s exhausting. The Quickfire Challenges, on the other hand, where you don’t have much time to cook, were totally energizing. They’re as close to live television as you can get. I liked the Quickfires because you really only have 5 minutes, tops, to think about what you’re going to make after you’ve heard the rules. Your instincts kick in and the adrenaline pushes you through. It really levels the playing field and lets a chef’s true talents shine.</p>
<p class="indent">Being on <i>Top Chef All-Stars</i> was a little different because we’d all been there before, so there wasn’t much the judges could do that we wouldn’t expect or know how to handle. And while the Elimination Challenges were interesting on both seasons I did the show, I think my favorite was the Ellis Island challenge, where we had to come up with a dish based on our heritage. To be able to see my family and cook from my heart was something I knew I had to do to make it to the finals. The Ellis Island episode is where I also learned that my competitor, Antonia Lofaso, was a distant cousin, <a id="page_200"/>which made for an even more friendly competition and lifelong friendship. The “Not My Cousin’s Mussels” recipe in this chapter is a shout-out to her.</p>
<p class="indent">Growing up on the East Coast, eating shellfish was pretty common. I learned the “real” way to prepare shellfish in culinary school, and as I learned under my chef mentors I refined my technique. Shellfish is a staple in Italian and Mediterranean cooking, and it’s important to use really fresh ingredients when making these recipes. Find a fishmonger or good fish and seafood purveyor in your area and get to know them so they’ll order the freshest, best shellfish for you.</p>

Place each disc between two sheets of plastic wrap and, using a flat mallet, very gently pound them to about <span class="font">⅛</span> inch thick. Keep covered with plastic wrap and refrigerate.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>2.</b></span> Toast the pine nuts in a dry sauté pan for 5 minutes, shaking the pan often to prevent burning.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>3.</b></span> Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a medium sauté pan over medium heat. Add the bacon and sauté for 8 minutes, until crispy. Keeping the fat in the pan, remove the cooked bacon and drain on a paper towel. Mince the bacon.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>4.</b></span> Add the bread crumbs to the bacon fat and sauté over medium heat for 2–3 minutes. If the bread crumbs begin to brown, remove from heat. Transfer the bread crumbs to a mixing bowl and let cool. Stir in the bacon, chives, and salt.</p>
<p class="step"><a id="page_215"/><span class="color"><b>5.</b></span> Set up the breading station with three separate shallow bowls for flour, egg, and bacon bread crumbs.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>6.</b></span> Dredge each scallop disc in flour, then egg, then bread crumbs. Patting the bread crumbs on the scallop will ensure they stick.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>7.</b></span> Heat ½ cup of olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. In small batches, fry the scallops for 1 minute on each side until golden brown. If the breading browns too quickly, lower the heat to medium.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>8.</b></span> Remove scallops from the pan and place on a cooling rack or paper towels to drain.

<p class="noindent"><i>Traditionally, mussels are steamed in wine. They’re delicious that way, don’t get me wrong. That said, I like mine steamed in beer, and I really like them steamed in Yuengling. If you can’t find Yuengling where you live, use whatever amber lager you prefer. The mussels with the beer make for a delicious broth that you won’t want to leave in the bowl when you’re done, so have some slices of grilled or toasted ciabatta nearby to finish this off.</i></p>
