 TOMATO &amp; ARTICHOKE PANZANELLA</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_blue" id="nad0003003">
<em>I remember watching someone make panzanella on a very popular TV show, where the contestants each host a dinner party for the others in their own home. I watched that show more for the amusing voiceover than for the recipes. This particular cook didn’t exactly make soaked stale bread look appealing when he literally turned the mixture into mush. The key here is not to over-soak or over-handle, but to leave it just long enough to get delicious flavour into the dry bread. With the artichokes, tomatoes and fresh basil, this is a delicious combination. It’s the kind of dish I would serve as a starter, or as a side with a main, or as a light lunch. I always make a mountain of the stuff for our barbecue table in the summer.</em>
