			<p class="rec-intro">This wonderful bread is flavoured with dried ceps and the delicate sweetness of confit garlic – garlic cloves cooked slowly and gently in olive oil. Good served on its own or with a seasonal salad.</p>

		<div class="basic-text-frame">
			<p class="serves">Makes 1 large loaf</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">60g dried ceps</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">425ml warm water</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">25g fresh yeast</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">400g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 tbsp olive oil</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">100g spelt flour</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">100g rye flour</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 tbsp thyme leaves, picked from the stems</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">12 confit garlic cloves</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">salt</p>
			<p class="for-the">confit garlic</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 garlic bulb 	</p>

		<div class="basic-text-frame">
			<p class="body">Cover the ceps with 150ml of the water and leave them to soak for 30 minutes. Dissolve the yeast in the rest of the water in a large bowl, then stir in the white flour with a wooden spatula. Cover and leave in a warm place to rise and double in volume. Drain the ceps (reserving the liquid) and fry them in the olive oil for 1 minute. Drain again and set aside. </p>
			<p class="body">In the bowl of a food mixer, put the soaking water of the ceps, the spelt and rye flours, thyme leaves, a pinch of salt and the risen first dough. Knead at a low speed with the dough hook for 10 minutes. Scrape down the dough from the edges of the bowl and knead for another 2 minutes. Cover and leave to rise for 30 minutes. </p>
			<p class="body">Knock the dough back, then gently work in the ceps and confit garlic cloves without breaking them up. Do this by folding the bread over on itself several times. Shape the dough into a loaf and place it on a floured baking sheet, then cover and leave to rise for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 220°C/Fan 200°C/Gas 7 and bake the loaf for 35–40 minutes. Cool on a wire rack. </p>
			<p class="alt-head">Confit garlic</p>
			<p class="body">Separate the garlic cloves, peel them and blanch in boiling water. Drain and put the cloves on a piece of foil, sprinkle with sea salt and a generous amount of olive oil, then wrap up in the foil to make a loose ‘bag’. Place this on a baking sheet and bake in the oven at 170°C/Fan 150°C/Gas 3½ for about 30 minutes. Shake the garlic in the foil ‘bag’ a few times during the cooking. Leave to cool before using. </p>
