  <h3 class="h3a">Tuscan rabbit salad</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">I love the tangy taste that comes from cooking the rabbit in vinegar and wine; it is then marinated, resulting in tender, flavoursome pieces of meat. Served in a salad with bulgur wheat and beans, it makes a perfectly balanced, simple meal. If you prefer, you can substitute chicken for the rabbit. To use dried borlotti beans, soak them in water overnight, then drain and simmer in fresh water for about 1 hour, or until the beans are tender (check the packet instructions). Drain and leave to cool.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4–6</p>

  <p class="ing1">700ml/1¼ pints/3 cups white wine vinegar</p>

  <p class="ing1">700ml/1¼ pints/3 cups dry white wine</p>

  <p class="ing1">½ tsp salt</p>

  <p class="ing1">1kg/2lb 4oz rabbit pieces on the bone</p>

  <p class="ing1">250g/9oz bulgur wheat</p>

  <p class="ing1">200g/7oz fresh or frozen broad (fava) beans</p>

  <p class="ing1">200g/7oz cooked or canned borlotti beans</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 small red onion, finely sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">juice of 1 lemon</p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the marinade</p>

  <p class="ing1">500ml/18fl oz/2 cups olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 garlic cloves, squashed and left whole</p>

  <p class="ing1">6 sage leaves</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 rosemary sprigs</p>

  <p class="ing2">1 red chilli, finely sliced</p>

  <p class="para">In a large saucepan, heat 700ml/1¼ pints/3 cups of water with the vinegar and wine. Add the salt and rabbit, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 35 minutes, until the rabbit is tender and cooked through.</p>

  <p class="para">Combine the ingredients for the marinade and set aside.</p>

  <p class="para">Remove the rabbit from the pan and leave until cool enough to handle, then remove the flesh from the bones. Put the meat in the marinade, cover with clingfilm (plastic wrap) and leave to marinate for 2 hours.</p>

  <p class="para">Meanwhile, cook the bulgur wheat for about 15 minutes, until al dente – check the packet instructions. Drain and leave to cool. Cook the broad beans for about 10 minutes (less if using frozen beans), until tender but not mushy, drain and leave to cool.</p>

  <p class="para1">Combine the cooked bulgur wheat, broad beans, borlotti beans and red onion, adding as much or as little of the olive oil from the marinade as you like, together with lemon juice to taste, and toss well. Place on a serving dish and top with the pieces of marinated rabbit.</p>
