<h1 class="chapter">toasted bread with tomato &amp; clam sauce</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>This is a good way to use up the tomato and clam sauce on <a href="9781784881757_Split60.html#page_97">cheat’s spaghetti with clams</a>. It makes a delicious seafood-flavour canapé and goes down very well with a glass of Prosecco.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 8 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>½ quantity of tomato and clam sauce (see <a href="9781784881757_Split60.html#page_97">cheat’s spaghetti with clams</a>)</b></p>
<p class="tx3"><b>TO SERVE</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>16 small slices of bread from a baguette</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>small handful of parsley, roughly chopped</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Put the clam sauce in a saucepan over a medium heat and let it reduce until it is dense and more like a spread than a sauce – around 20 minutes should do it. To serve, toast the bread as in the recipe for <a href="9781784881757_Split73.html#page_119">Toasted Bread Topped with Chicken Liver Pâté</a>. Top the bread with the sauce (there is no need to dip it in the stock this time). Garnish each one with a little parsley and serve straight away.</p>
