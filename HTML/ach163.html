<p class="author1"><span class="txit">biscotti tropiano</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This is my grandmother’s recipe for biscotti—she taught my mother how to bake them and my mother taught me. They are wonderful with coffee or dipped in red wine.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups all-purpose flour</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 teaspoons baking power</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> teaspoon kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons anise seeds</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 large eggs</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup sugar</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup (<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> stick) butter, melted and cooled</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 tablespoons pure anise extract or anisette liqueur</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Preheat oven to 350° F. Grease and flour two baking sheets or line them with parchment paper, and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> In a medium-size bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir in the anise seeds. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Place the eggs in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer on high speed until foamy. Add the sugar and beat until smooth, about 1 minute. Beat in the melted butter and anise extract. Reduce the speed to low and beat in the dry ingredients just until incorporated.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> With a rubber spatula, scoop one quarter of the dough out onto one of the prepared baking sheets. Use the spatula to shape the dough into a log about 10 inches long by 2 inches wide by <sup class="sup">3</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> inch thick. Repeat this procedure with the other three quarters of the dough. Place two logs 2 inches apart on each prepared baking sheet.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> Bake until the logs are light golden brown and firm to the touch, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow the logs to cool slightly on the baking sheets.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">6.</span> Reduce the oven temperature to 325° F.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_325"/><span class="red">7.</span> Lift each log off the baking sheet and transfer to a cutting board. Use a serrated knife to cut each log on the bias at 1-inch intervals. Lay the cookies, cut side down, on the baking sheets.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">8.</span> Return the biscotti to the oven and bake until lightly browned and dry, about 5 minutes. Turn them over and continue baking to dry and lightly brown the other side, another 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 1 month.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATION</span>:</span> Almonds make a nice addition to these cookies—stir <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup coarsely chopped almonds into the batter along with the dry ingredients.</p>
