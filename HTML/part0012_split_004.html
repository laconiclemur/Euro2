  <h3 class="h3a">Pot-roasted beef with extra virgin olive oil</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">This ancient dish, originating from the town of Rovato in Lombardy, northern Italy, is about 500 years old. At the time it was a dish cooked for the wealthy: they could afford not only meat but also ‘exotic’ ingredients such as anchovies and capers brought to Rovato by merchants travelling from Venice to Milan. The meat used for this dish is known in Italy as <em class="calibre4">cappello del prete</em> (priest’s hat), which is a triangular cut of beef from the outer part of the shoulder, ideally suited to slow cooking; chuck eye is the nearest equivalent and a good butcher should be able to provide it. The olive oil is an important part of the dish, so please do use good-quality extra virgin. The extra sauce can be served the next day with some runny polenta.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">200ml/7fl oz/scant 1 cup extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">1.2kg/2lb 10oz chuck eye or chuck beef joint or feather steak</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 tbsp capers, rinsed</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 anchovy fillets</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 onions, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 celery stalk, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 carrots, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">500ml/18fl oz/2 cups dry white wine</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 courgettes (zucchini), sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">30g/1oz Parmesan, grated</p>

  <p class="ing1">20g/¾oz/scant ¼ cup dried breadcrumbs</p>

  <p class="ing2">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="para">Heat the olive oil in a large flameproof pot, add the beef and brown well on all sides on a high heat. Add the capers and anchovies and cook on a medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon until the anchovies have dissolved. Stir in the onions, celery and carrots, pour in the wine, cover with a lid and cook on a low heat for 1 hour.</p>

  <p class="para">Add the courgettes and continue to cook for a further 1 hour.</p>

  <p class="para">Remove the meat from the pot and set aside. Using a food processor or blender, blend the vegetables and liquid until smooth. Stir in the Parmesan and breadcrumbs and season with salt and pepper to taste. Slice the meat and serve with the sauce.</p>
