<p class="nonindent" id="p1">I arrived on these shores twelve years ago as a young Spaniard who thought he knew it all. What I discovered was not the end of my journey, but the start of one. For the last decade and more, I’ve been searching inside myself for the meaning of Spanish cooking. Searching for the traditional cooking I grew up with, and adore, and live for. To me, it’s so much more than work or what pays my salary. It’s a way of life. I smell, I breathe, I think, I dream of cooking—and, more often than not, of Spanish cooking. As I’ve traveled across America, I’ve learned so much about this country’s cooking and so much more about my own country’s cooking. I’m absorbed by the search for what happened through the centuries—the different cultures, religions, and peoples that shaped Spanish cooking into what it is today. It was only by exploring the New World that I could see the real nature of the Old.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p2">Every night at my tapas restaurants, we try to bring the culture and the flavors of Spain to America. Yet for me, something else happened while I was re-creating the best of my country: by bringing Spanish cooking to America, I discovered how to combine traditional Spanish dishes with the amazing ingredients and bounty of this extraordinary country. I don’t import fish from Spain for all our dishes (sometimes it even comes from the Pacific Ocean). But that doesn’t mean that my Spanish cooking is any less traditional or less authentic in America. On the contrary: it becomes richer by adapting its spirit to the flesh of the local ingredients. I could spend days telling you how great things are in Spain: the fish, the meat, the soul of the country. But after spending half my adult life in the United States, I have grown into a unique hybrid, combining the <a id="page10"/>best traditions I learned at home with the open-minded approach that lies at the heart of America.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p3">My first contact with the United States was as a young sailor in the Spanish navy, visiting Pensacola, Norfolk, and New York. I thought at the time that I had accomplished my childhood dream of visiting the United States. But somewhere on that trip, something inside me told me I’d be coming back. A few months later, after returning to Spain, I finished my military service and flew back to New York—this time as a <span class="italic">cocinero</span>, or cook. All I had was a small bag on my back, a couple of chef’s coats, a little money, and a big dream of conquering America with Spanish cooking. I was also lucky enough to have a job at two restaurants: El Dorado Petit and Paradis Barcelona. El Dorado Petit was one of the best restaurants in Spain, and it was trying to sell New York its version of Catalan cooking. Unfortunately, neither restaurant made it.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p4">Even though they lost a lot of money, those restaurants did an amazing job of trying to refresh what Spanish restaurants should be (and showed me, as a young chef, some critical mistakes). During my time in New York, one person who influenced me more than anyone else was Clemente Bocos, at El Cid in lower Manhattan, an amazing little tapas place. Clemente became like a father to me, with a ready phrase to guide me and a deep interest in my future. One very cold night, while we were sharing the most wonderful garlic soup and I was venting my frustrations about the restaurants, Clemente gave me a very wise piece of advice: “José,” he said, “no matter what you do, don’t try to reinvent Spanish cooking in America. Don’t try to guess what Americans would like to eat. Cook what you remember from Spain. Don’t listen to people who say, ‘They won’t like this or that.’ If you stick to the basics, and execute them well, people will like your cooking, and they will like Spanish food.”</p>
<p class="indent" id="p5">That was just before I was contacted by my current partners and friends, Roberto Álvarez and Rob Wilder, who told me they wanted to open a tapas place in Washington, D.C., and needed a <a id="page11"/>Spanish chef. They gave me the restaurants, and I gave them my expertise, my ideas, and my spirit. The lessons I’d learned in New York proved invaluable in creating Jaleo—a catchy name for a Spanish restaurant, named after the John Singer Sargent painting of a flamenco party. Eleven years later, the woman at the heart of this classic painting now dances on the walls of three Jaleos, each serving 5,000 people a week.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p6">I can’t tell you how many of our friends and customers at Jaleo started coming to the restaurant as children and have brought their first dates to Jaleo. It makes me smile inside to know that, at least in Washington, a younger generation has grown up knowing and understanding the cooking of my land. It’s been hard work, and we still have a long way to go, but Spanish food is more widely available than ever, and Spanish wines are better known than ever. And I think the best is still to come.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p7">This book is a celebration of the two countries that are closest to my heart; of the best that Spain and America have given me; of my love for the food, the ingredients, and the people that make it happen. I hope you’ll find your own reason to keep exploring Spanish food, and to keep making it happen in America.</p>
