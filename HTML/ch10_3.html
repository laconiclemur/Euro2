<h2 class="h2" id="ch10"><a id="page_302"/>BEANS AND POTATOES<br/><span class="blue"><small>RUSTIC ELEGANCE</small></span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Spanish cuisine presents a delicious dichotomy. On the one hand it’s all Mediterranean lightness; on the other, it’s defined by big-flavored stews starring potatoes and legumes. Because the bean pot is central to <a id="page_303"/>traditional Spanish cooking, no other country treats legumes with so much finesse and respect. Chickpeas, lentils, and favas have been relished in Spain since antiquity. Another bean species, <em>Phaseolus vulgaris</em> (which includes kidney beans), hails from the New World and was originally cultivated and popularized in Spain by the monks. Historically cheap, tasty, nutritious, and easy to grow, legumes form the backbone of the most important family of Spanish dishes: <em>potajes, guisos, ollas, potes, pucheros, cocidos</em>. These bracing stews, soups, and casseroles normally combine pulses and vegetables with meat or, during Lent, bacalao. Once the pillar of <em>cocina pobre</em>—poor man’s cuisine—today best-quality legumes can be as expensive as seasonal vegetables, and <a id="page_304"/>top-grade charcuterie likewise isn’t cheap. No matter. Bean cuisine continues to flourish in Spain—in homes, at humble roadside <em>tabernas,</em> and at Michelin-starred restaurants where an ethereal emulsion of white beans or chickpeas might come topped with <em>cigalas</em> (langoustines) or sautéed foie gras.</p>
<p class="indent">Spanish cooks treat legumes in a manner that borders on fetishistic. That’s because their beans, lentils, and chickpeas are precious jewels compared to those of most other countries. The best kinds are awarded prizes and afforded prestigious denomination of origin status, like fine wines or boutique olive oils. All over Spain, there are bean-harvesting fiestas and bean-cooking contests. At markets, reputable vendors will often advertise the age of their beans, lest you suspect them to be old and grainy.</p>
<p class="indent">Bean preparation is taken seriously here. The cooking liquid is kept at the merest of simmers, and cold water is regularly splashed into the pot to lower the temperature (a nifty technique that keeps beans meltingly tender yet completely intact). The sausages are often precooked separately to cast off excess fat. The resulting bean stews come out tasting pure, noble, and improbably light.</p>
<p class="indent">And the potato? Scorned and neglected for almost three centuries after its introduction to Spain in the 1570s, today <em>la patata</em> forms a whole subgenre of Spanish gastronomy. The litany of evocatively titled potato dishes is long enough to fill many chapters. Recipe names like <em>patatas a lo pobre</em> (poor man’s potatoes) and <em>patatas viudas</em> (widowed potatoes) hint at their frugal simplicity. But there are heartier dishes, too, such as <em>patatas a la riojana</em> with chorizo and peppers; the saucy Basque potatoes in <em>salsa verde</em>; a wondrous <em>zorongollo</em> from Extremadura—sautéed potatoes and roasted peppers bathed in roasted tomato sauce.</p>
<p class="indent">Substantial potato dishes are often featured as the main course at lunch. In this chapter, potatoes also appear stuffed with salt cod <em>brandada</em>; sliced and layered with an unusual <em>picadillo</em> of minced chorizo and dates; cooked in salt and served with a piquant <em>mojo</em> in the style of Canary Islands; and gratinéed with a garlicky Catalan <em>allioli.</em> Though the poverty is long gone, <em>cocina pobre</em> staples continue to captivate Spanish taste buds. They’ll do the same for yours.</p>

<h3 class="h3r">FABADA THE ASTURIAN CASSOULET</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>FABADA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">What paella is to Valencia, <em>fabada</em> is to the misty, mountainous Asturias region: a one-dish masterpiece that gourmands from all over Spain will happily travel to eat. Along with Brazilian <em>feijoada</em> and French cassoulet, <em>fabada</em> deserves pride of place in the pantheon of the world’s greatest bean dishes. And while even the best cassoulet can be somewhat sludgy and over-rich—not to mention staggeringly time-consuming—a well-prepared <em>fabada</em> will taste light and beautifully restrained.</p>
<p class="indent">Scrupulous cooking and the quality of Asturian <em>embutidos</em> (charcuterie) is what makes a good <em>fabada</em> so special. The legumes are the stark white, enormous oblong beans called <em>fabes de la granja,</em> which boast their own denomination of origin. The meats that go into <em>fabada</em> are collectively called <em>campagno,</em> meaning comrade or complement. These always include artisanally produced Asturian chorizo and blood sausage, and sometimes pancetta or bacon, and/or <em>lacon,</em> the pink salt-cured ham that needs to be soaked in cold water. To avoid the dish being overly smoky and greasy, perfectionist chefs usually blanch the meats. They also insist that the <em>fabada</em> has to be cooked long and slow, with the liquid barely bubbling. At many restaurants, <em>fabada</em> is served in two courses—first the beans, as a soup, followed by the <em>campagno.</em></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 piece (½ pound) pancetta</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ pound sweet Spanish-style chorizo sausage</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ pound morcilla or other blood sausage</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size onions; 1 cut in half, 1 finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 large fresh flat-leaf parsley sprigs</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 medium-size garlic cloves, smashed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 small bay leaves</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 cups (about 1½ pounds) Asturian fabes (see <a class="nounder" href="ch10.html#ch10_note1">Note</a>) or white cannellini beans, soaked overnight or quick-soaked (see <a class="nounder" href="ch10.html#page_308">page 308</a>) and drained</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 piece (1½ pounds) good smoky ham, preferably with a bone</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About 1½ cups cold chicken stock or broth, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon smoked sweet Spanish paprika, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large pinch of saffron, pulverized in a mortar and steeped in 2 tablespoons very hot water</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Bring a medium-size pot of water to a boil. Add the pancetta, chorizo, and <em>morcilla</em> and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Drain, setting the <em>morcilla</em> aside separately.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the onion halves, parsley, garlic, and bay leaves in a double layer of cheesecloth and tie it shut.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place the beans, ham, pancetta, and chorizo in a 6-quart pot and add cold water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil over high heat, thoroughly skimming off the foam, and add the cheesecloth bag of aromatics. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and cook for 1 hour, skimming the foam off occasionally and adding 3 to 4 tablespoons of the cold chicken stock every 20 minutes. The cooking liquid should barely bubble.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a medium-size skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until soft but not browned, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the paprika. Stir the onion mixture into the bean pot along with the <em>morcilla</em> and saffron. Cook until the beans are completely tender and creamy but not falling apart, about 45 minutes to 1 hour longer, adding some cold chicken stock every 20 minutes to maintain the level of liquid.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> To serve, remove the cheesecloth bag from the pot and discard it. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the ham, pancetta, chorizo, and <em>morcilla</em> to a cutting board. If there are any bean skins floating on top of the cooking liquid, skim them off. Remove about ¼ cup of the beans from the pot, mash them up coarsely with a fork, and stir them back into the beans. Cut the meats into chunks and slice the sausages, then carefully stir them into the beans. Taste the stew; if you’d like it a little redder and smokier, heat a little more olive oil in a small skillet over low heat, add about 1 teaspoon paprika, and stir the paprika mixture into the beans. Ladle the stew into soup bowls and serve. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 10 TO 12</strong></span></p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="ch10_note1"/><span class="blue"><strong>NOTE:</strong></span> <em>Fabes,</em> the huge, tender beans used for <em>fabada,</em> are available by mail order (see <a class="nounder" href="app04.html#page_461">page 461</a>). While not cheap, they’ll make the dish extra special. However, you can still create an excellent <em>fabada</em> with regular white beans, such as cannellini. Some like their <em>fabada</em> thicker, some thinner; the texture is easily regulated by mashing the desired amount of the beans and stirring them into the pot.</p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_306"/><span class="blue">BEAN FUSS</span></p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">The primal place of legumes on the Spanish table today is understandable when you consider the quality of the raw material. Catalans go nuts for the small, smooth white Santa Pau beans from the volcanic Garrotxa region, so delicious with grilled <em>butifarra</em> sausage. Castilians are willing to pay through the nose for the large, buttery <em>judiones de la Granja,</em> white beans grown near Segovia that are slowly simmered with a whole assortment of pig parts. Any good <em>cocido</em> restaurant in Madrid has a secret supplier in León or Salamanca that provides artisanal chickpeas with the thinnest skins and the texture of velvet. Asturians fuss over their huge white oval <em>fabes,</em> which star in <em>fabada,</em> the region’s answer to French cassoulet. Rioja and Navarra are famed for <em>pochas,</em> fresh white beans from the vine stewed together with anything from quail to partridge to bacalao to blood sausage to clams. Lentils come in several varieties, from creamy green <em>castellanas</em> to the small, nutty <em>pardinas,</em> which remain remarkably firm as they cook.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Most recipes in this chapter will be delicious made with supermarket dried chickpeas or beans (I recommend the Goya brand). For something better than good, seek out best-quality organic legumes, or, better still, order boutique Spanish beans (see <a class="nounder" href="app04.html#page_461">page 461</a> for sources). Twelve bucks for a pound isn’t too much—not when you consider that these are the Champagne of beans.</p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>POTAJE DE LENTEJAS Y CALABAZA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">This nourishing <em>potaje</em> flavored with fresh <em>and</em> roasted garlic makes a terrific vegetarian entrée. If you prefer it more full-bodied, however, use chicken broth instead of water and feel free to add a handful of chopped pancetta to the <em>sofrito</em> in Step 4. You can serve the dish as a soupy first course or over rice.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 large garlic head, plus 4 minced garlic cloves</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing the garlic</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size onions; 1 cut in half, 1 finely chopped</strong></p>

If the lentils seem too thick, add some or all of the remaining water. Season the lentils with salt and black pepper to taste and simmer until the lentils and pumpkin are very soft, about 10 minutes longer (it’s all right if the pumpkin begins to disintegrate a bit).</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Remove the cheesecloth bag from the lentils and discard all but the garlic head.

<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Good-quality legumes in Spain tend to be dried for a longer period of time than those dried in the States. So, Spanish cooks always insist on an overnight soak. Beans available in the States, however, often cook to a firmer, smoother texture when quick-soaked. To quick soak 2 cups of beans or chickpeas, bring about 3 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot over high heat. Add the beans and let boil for 2 to 3 minutes. Take the beans off the heat, cover the pot, and let the beans stand for 1 hour. Drain the beans before using.</p>

<h3 class="h3r">LENTIL AND WILD MUSHROOM HASH WITH POACHED EGGS</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>LENTEJAS CON SETAS Y HUEVOS ESCALFADOS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">The earthy combination of lentils, dusky mushrooms, and slightly runny poached egg is nothing if not inspired. Syrupy balsamic vinegar <a id="page_309"/>and good olive oil drizzled around the edges lend special savor and elegance. Serve it as a brunch dish or a first course for a winter meal. Without the eggs, the lentil and mushroom hash makes a delicious side dish. Though supermarket brown lentils are fine, the best legumes for the job are firm, high-quality lentils, such as Spanish <em>pardinas,</em> French du Puy, or Italian lentils from Umbria.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>¾ cup lentils (see <a class="nounder" href="ch10.html#ch10_note2">Note</a>), rinsed and picked over</strong></p>

<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>9 to 10 ounces assorted wild mushrooms or a mixture of wild and cultivated mushrooms (chanterelles, cèpes, morels, trompettes-de-la-mort, oyster, and/or cremini), wiped clean with a damp paper towel and coarsely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons dry sherry</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley, plus more for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 to 6 large eggs (1 egg per serving)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons syrupy aged balsamic vinegar, or ⅓ cup thin balsamic vinegar reduced over medium-high heat to 3 tablespoons</strong></p>

Drain the lentils, discarding the bay leaf and garlic.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> While the lentils are cooking, heat 4 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

<p class="image"><a id="page_310"/><img alt="Image" src="../images/p310-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="caption"><strong>Chickpea Stew with Chorizo and Meatballs</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">The origin of this recipe has dissolved under a stain of red wine in my notebook. There was a village bar. There was a bowl of these chickpeas, strewn with tiny meatballs and smoky from the <em>pimentón.</em> There was a recipe jotted down, which I have since made often. Perhaps it was in Castile or Andalusia or Extremadura—all regions where these ingredients would be used. What ultimately matters is the homey, comforting taste.</p>
<p class="indent">The meatballs add a special touch to the stew, but it is also delicious with the chorizo alone. Just skip the meatballs part and increase the amount of chorizo to ten to twelve ounces.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE CHICKPEAS:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup dried chickpeas (garbanzo beans), soaked overnight or quick-soaked (see <a class="nounder" href="ch10.html#page_308">page 308</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 bay leaf</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 ounces sweet Spanish-style chorizo sausage</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE MEATBALLS:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 slices white sandwich bread, crusts removed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>10 ounces ground pork (not too lean)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup grated onion</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small egg, lightly beaten</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR FINISHING THE STEW:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size onion, finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size carrot, finely diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 medium-size garlic cloves, minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 large ripe tomatoes, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon smoked sweet Spanish paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Prepare the chickpeas: Place the chickpeas in a heavy 4- to 5-quart pot, add cold water to cover by 2 inches, and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the bay leaf, reduce the heat to low, and simmer, partially covered, for 1 hour, periodically replenishing the liquid with more water.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> After 1 hour, cook the chorizo in boiling water for 2 minutes and drain it. Add the chorizo to the chickpeas and continue cooking until the chickpeas are tender but still a little al dente, about 30 minutes longer, adding more water to maintain the level of liquid.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> While the chickpeas are cooking, make the meatballs: Place the bread in a small bowl, add cold water to cover, and let soak for 5 minutes. Drain and squeeze out the excess liquid, then finely crumble the bread. Place the bread, pork, onion, egg, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Gently knead the meatball mixture with your hands just until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined. If the mixture is too moist to form into meatballs, refrigerate it for 30 minutes to 1 hour.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 425°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> With oiled hands, shape the mixture into meatballs the size of a cherry tomato. Arrange the meatballs on a baking sheet and bake, shaking the <a id="page_312"/>pan once or twice, until they are lightly browned and firm to the touch, about 12 minutes. Set aside until ready to use.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> To finish the stew: Heat the olive oil in a medium-size skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onion, carrot, and half of the garlic and cook until soft but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, cover the skillet, and cook for about 5 minutes. Add the paprika, stir for a few seconds, then stir the tomato mixture into the chickpeas. Cook the stew until the chickpeas are very tender, 15 to 20 minutes longer.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">7.</span></strong> Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chorizo to a cutting board. Cut it into ½-inch slices and return them to the pot. Gently stir in the meatballs and simmer them in the stew for about 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">8.</span></strong> Place the remaining garlic, the parsley, and a pinch of salt in a mortar and, using a pestle, crush them to a paste.

<h3 class="h3r">CHICKPEA &amp; SHRIMP SAUTE</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>GARBANZOS SALTEADOS CON GAMBAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">It is quite common in Spain to combine humble legumes with luxury items, like foie gras, partridge, or fancy crustaceans. At La Castela tapas bar in Madrid, one of the most sought-after dishes is chickpeas sautéed with the much-prized langoustines called <em>cigalas.</em> The dish is divine, thanks to the small, creamy, pedigreed chickpeas, the sweet, delicate langoustines, and the gentle kick of wild garlic shoots. Though you don’t find these ingredients in the States, I’ve devised a simple yet excellent version using shrimp, scallions, and canned chickpeas. The important thing here is to use a well-reduced crustacean stock to infuse the chickpeas with a nice marine flavor. Serve them as a substantial tapa or a light main course; a touch of <em>allioli</em> is most welcome.</p>
<p class="uln1"><a id="page_313"/><strong>4 tablespoons fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>POCHAS CON ALMEJAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Traditionally during Lent when meat was prohibited, beans were paired with clams or salt cod rather than chorizo or salt pork. The bean-and-clam combination proved so addictive that these days it’s a year-round staple at seafood restaurants along the Cantabrian coast in the north. I order the dish whenever I can, and when I can’t, I make it at home because this is one of my one-pot favorites.</p>

<h3 class="h3r">BASQUE POTATOES IN SALSA VERDE</h3>
<p class="noindent">An everyday Basque classic for which every cook has a favorite recipe, these potatoes are so saucy that they border on soup. Normally they are served in bowls as a first course or as a lunch dish with lots of bread. Some like them plain, others might add peas, bacalao, or a broth made with the head of <em>merluza,</em> or hake. (A few clams thrown in at the end are lovely as well.) If you reduce the amount of liquid a little and increase the flour to 1½ tablespoons, the potatoes can serve as a side dish. Add more liquid and you’ll have a great soup. This recipe is from my friend Oscar Alberdi, whose Bilbao restaurant is considered a temple of bacalao and other traditional Basque specialties. Oscar’s savory trick is to add the slightly briny liquid from canned artichokes or Spanish white asparagus to the parsley-flecked sauce instead of (or in addition to) broth. If you don’t have any on hand, use all broth.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>2 pounds medium-size all-purpose boiling potatoes, peeled</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 tablespoons fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 large garlic cloves, minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup liquid from canned artichokes or asparagus (optional; you will need two 14-ounce cans)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 cups chicken stock or broth (use 3 cups if not using the vegetable liquid)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Crusty bread, for serving</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Cut the potatoes in half and slice each half into 4 to 6 wedges. Pat the wedges dry with paper towels so they don’t stick when cooked. Heat the olive oil in a heavy 3-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add the potatoes and cook until they begin to soften and take on some color, 5 to 7 minutes, stirring often so they don’t stick to the bottom. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the potatoes to a bowl.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> If there seems to be too much oil in the pan, pour off all but 2 tablespoons. Reduce the heat to low, add the garlic and 1 tablespoon of the parsley, and cook until the garlic is very fragrant but not browned, about 1 minute. Add the flour and cook, stirring, to form a paste, about 30 seconds. Gradually add the wine and the vegetable liquid or 1 cup of the chicken stock, increase the heat to <a id="page_316"/>medium, and stir until the sauce thickens. Slowly add the 2 cups chicken stock and bring the liquid to a simmer.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Return the potatoes to the saucepan and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover the saucepan and reduce the heat to low. Simmer, stirring occasionally and scraping the bottom of the pot, until the potatoes are extremely tender and some begin to fall apart, 25 to 30 minutes. Stir in the remaining 4 tablespoons parsley and cook about 1 minute. Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and/or pepper as necessary.

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>PATATAS CON CHORIZO A LA RIOJANA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Tasting the sweet, fleshy potatoes from La Rioja, one understands why they are so central to this region’s cuisine: Even humble french fries here somehow taste like ambrosia. Much of the region’s potato production is concentrated around the picturesque Romanesque town of Santo Domingo de la Calzada. While some of these potatoes are destined for chips and other “industrial” uses all over Spain, locals keep the best varieties, such as Desiree or Marfona, for themselves. In this stew, chorizo is a flavoring rather than the main ingredient, and the dish can be served as a soupy first course or as a main course for lunch, with good bread and an astringent green salad.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 large dried pimiento choricero or ancho chile, stemmed, seeded, and torn into pieces</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or more if needed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size onion, quartered and sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small green bell pepper, cored, seeded, and thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 to 8 ounces sweet Spanish-style chorizo sausage, cut into ½-inch slices</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size garlic cloves, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon smoked sweet Spanish paprika, or ½ teaspoon unsmoked sweet paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup white Rioja or another crisp, dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 bay leaf</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About 2 cups chicken stock or broth or water</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Minced fresh flat-leaf parsley, for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Soak the <em>pimiento choricero</em> in ½ cup very hot water until softened, about 30 minutes. Place it and the soaking liquid in a blender and puree until smooth.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Cut the potatoes into irregular chunks by inserting the tip of a small, sharp knife into a potato and twisting it until a 1½-inch chunk comes out.

<p class="indentt"><a id="page_317"/><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a 4-quart flameproof casserole over medium-low heat. Add the onion and red and green bell peppers and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes.

Add the potatoes and garlic and cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the paprika and stir for a few seconds. Add the wine and bay leaf, the pureed <em>pimiento,</em> and enough chicken stock to barely cover the potatoes. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil, skimming any foam off the surface, if necessary. Cover the casserole, reduce the heat to low, and cook until the potatoes are very tender and some chunks are just beginning to fall apart, 20 to 30 minutes. Transfer 2 or 3 potato chunks to a bowl, mash them, whisk in 2 to 3 tablespoons of the cooking liquid, and stir back into the casserole. Let the stew rest, covered, for 10 minutes. Remove and discard the bay leaf. Spoon the stew into bowls and serve, sprinkled with parsley. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6</strong></span></p>

<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent"><em>Cocidos, pucheros, potajes, potes . . .</em> these über-Spanish soup/stews all come out of the proverbial <em>olla podrida,</em> or rotten pot, a dish that occupies a mythical place in the Spanish culinary consciousness. It’s been long held that the word <em>podrida</em> (rotten) refers to the semi-disintegrated state of ingredients left to simmer, sometimes for days. Revisionist scholarship, however, suggests that <em>podrida</em> might be a corruption of <em>poderida,</em> from <em>poderoso</em>—powerful—an allusion either to the sustaining might of the dish or to the fact that, complete with multiple meats, the <em>olla</em> could only be enjoyed by the rich and the powerful.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">The progenitor of <em>olla podrida</em> is thought to be a Sephardic casserole called <em>adafina</em> (from the Arab word <em>dafana,</em> to cover). A Sabbath dish of beans, chickpeas, chicken, raisins, and hard-boiled eggs, <em>adafina</em> was put to simmer on a Friday so it could be enjoyed on Saturday, when no cooking was allowed. The Spanish appropriated the dish around the sixteenth century, adding a whole roster of pork stuffs, so as to catholicize it. Or, it could have been the Marranos (converted Jews) who first added pork to the <em>adafina,</em> in their effort to convince Christian neighbors of their faith and avoid the Inquisition. Some scholars speculate that olla podrida has its roots in a thirteenth-century Arabic dish called <em>sinhaji,</em> a slow-simmered mélange of different meats, chickpeas, meatballs, and spices.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">In any case, the classic imperial <em>olla podrida</em> was nothing if not epic. A late sixteenth-century recipe calls for many pounds of pork gullet, hock, snout, and ears; wild boar, sausage, and lamb; calf’s kidneys and beef; capons, chickens, pigeons, and hindquarters of hare; pheasants, mallards, thrushes, partridges; chickpeas and red beans; garlic, onion, chestnuts, and cabbages—all served arranged in three tiers. So baroque was the dish that it soon disappeared from the repertoire, replaced by more sensible <em>cocidos, pucheros, potajes,</em> and <em>potes</em>. But the myth lives on.</p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>TRINXAT DE LA CERDANYA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">I love this quintessential winter dish of Cerdanya, a section of the Catalan Pyrenees where Barcelonans escape to breathe mountain air, pick wild mushrooms, or just lose themselves rambling on the back roads among wild goats and ram-shackle Romanesque churches. There, <em>trinxat</em> is prepared with potatoes and <em>col de invierno,</em> a local variety of winter cabbage. With its curly dark leaves, <em>col de invierno</em> is actually closer to our kale. Josep Maria Boix, a renowned local chef and owner of the exquisite Torre del Remei hotel, tells me that the stalks of this cabbage can grow as high as a person and that it tastes best after the first frosts. To make <em>trinxat,</em> home cooks just shake the snow and ice off the leaves and take them to their pans. The potatoes Boix uses are also special. Called <em>buffet,</em> “they are ugly as sin with all those eyes” but incredibly buttery (Yukon Golds make an adequate, if not quite perfect, substitute). In Cerdanya, <em>trinxat</em> is shaped into a cake the size of a skillet and served cut into wedges. If you prefer, it can also be shaped into smaller pancakes and fried on both sides.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>2½ pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>

<p class="uln"><strong>3 medium-size garlic cloves, minced</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the potatoes in a large pot, add enough cold salted water to cover by 2 inches, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and cook the potatoes until they are almost tender, about 15 minutes. Add the kale, pushing it down to submerge it in the liquid, and cook until the kale and the potatoes are tender, about 7 minutes. Drain thoroughly in a colander and transfer to a bowl. Mash and toss the vegetables together with a fork until the potatoes are half mashed.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a medium-size skillet over medium heat. Add the pancetta and cook for 1 minute.

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ZORONGOLLO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">This potato dish from the Extremadura region is unspeakably scrumptious! Depending on where you are and who’s doing the cooking, <em>zorongollo</em> takes slightly different guises. However, the dish normally features roasted red peppers and tomatoes. Here, they are combined with sliced potatoes in a delightful cross between a casserole and a salad, eaten warm or at room temperature. Sautéing potato slices in lots of extra-virgin olive oil makes them especially plush and not at all greasy, since the oil is drained off. However, to save time and oil, the potatoes can be boiled. <em>Zorongollo</em> is good as a light luncheon, with a salad; as a substantial tapa; or as an accompaniment to grilled lamb chops or fish.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1¼ cups olive oil for frying the potatoes, plus more for brushing the vegetables</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 meaty red bell peppers, cored, cut in half, and seeded</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size ripe tomatoes, cut in half</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small garlic head, outer layer of skin removed, top trimmed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup fragrant extra-virgin olive oil, for the dressing</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons best-quality red wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 pounds large Yukon Gold potatoes of uniform size, peeled, cut in half, and thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 fat scallions, trimmed, with about 3 inches of the green, thickly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 425°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil and oil it lightly. Gently crush the red peppers to flatten them. Place the peppers and tomatoes on the baking sheet, cut side up, along with the garlic head. Brush the vegetables with a little olive oil and bake until tender and lightly charred, 35 to 40 minutes. Transfer the tomatoes and garlic to a bowl. Transfer the peppers to another bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and let stand for 15 minutes. Peel the peppers and tear them into strips, setting them and their accumulated liquid aside separately. Remove and discard the tomato skins and chop the tomatoes coarsely. Squeeze out 5 roasted garlic cloves from the head, setting the rest aside for another use.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place the tomatoes, garlic cloves, and the reserved pepper juices in a mini food processor and pulse until pureed. Transfer the puree to a bowl and whisk in the ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil and the vinegar. Season the sauce with salt and black pepper to taste, then let stand until ready to use. (The tomato sauce can be prepared up to 1 day ahead; refrigerate, covered. Reheat before using.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Heat the 1¼ cups olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the potato slices, separating them with a spatula and sprinkling them generously with salt. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring gently.

<h3 class="h3r">POTATO AND ONION GRATIN WITH ALLIOLI</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>PATATAS PANADERAS CON ALLIOLI</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to be Catalan to agree that pretty much everything tastes better with <em>allioli,</em> the bold, garlicky mayonnaise that brings to life so many of the region’s dishes. <em>Patatas panaderas</em> (the classic Spanish baked sliced potatoes) are great on their own. But add a cup of <em>allioli</em> and you’ve got a treat. Serve the potatoes with simple roasts that could use a garlicky kick or with saucy dishes, such as Seafood Stew in Romesco Sauce (<a class="nounder" href="ch07.html#page_210">page 210</a>) or Meaty Oxtail Stew Torero Style (<a class="nounder" href="ch08.html#page_257">page 257</a>).</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for oiling the pan</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size onions, cut in half and thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 pounds baking potatoes of uniform size, peeled, rinsed, and patted dry</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ cup chicken stock or broth</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About 1½ cups Allioli (<a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_44">page 44</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring, until softened and lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes, adjusting the heat as necessary.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Using a mandoline, the slicing disk of a food processor, or a sharp knife, slice the potatoes into ⅛-inch-thick rounds.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 375°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Generously oil a heavy, shallow 12- by 9-inch baking dish, preferably earthenware or cast-enamel, or an oval gratin dish (you can also use a cast-iron skillet). Arrange some of the potatoes in one overlapping layer on the bottom of the baking dish, then season them generously with salt and pepper. Scatter half of the cooked onions on top. Arrange another layer of potatoes on top of the onions and season them with salt and pepper. Scatter the remaining onions over the potatoes and top with another layer of potatoes (you might not need all of the potato slices). Press the layers down to compact them. Pour the stock over the potatoes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_321"/><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake the potatoes until they feel tender when pierced with a knife, about 50 minutes. Uncover the baking dish, brush some olive oil on the potatoes, and bake for another 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Change the oven setting to broil. Being careful not to burn yourself, remove the baking dish from the oven and spread the <em>allioli</em> generously over the top. Broil until the top is browned in spots, 2 to 3 minutes. Let cool for a few minutes, cut into squares, and serve. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6 TO 8</strong></span></p>
<p class="indentt"><span class="blue"><strong>VARIATION:</strong></span> Potato gratins lend themselves to many variations. Instead of the <em>allioli,</em> you can top the gratin with Cabrales cheese, as might be done in Asturias. You can add sautéed bell peppers or Italian (frying) peppers and some chopped tomatoes or sautéed wild mushrooms to the layers of sautéed onions. Brushing the potato layers with a little saffron-infused oil is nice too.</p>

<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent"><em>Of provisions, besides maize, there are two other products which form the principal food of these Indians. One is called potato, and is a kind of earth nut which, after it has been boiled, is as tender as a cooked chestnut, but it has no more skin than a truffle, and it grows under the earth in the same way.</em></p>
<p class="attribution"><span class="blue">—Pedro Cieza de León, <em>Chronicle of Peru,</em> 1553</span></p>
<p class="sb-noindent1">A band of gold-seeking conquistadors led by Jiménez de Quesada “discovered” potatoes in what is now Colombia in 1537. They mistook them for truffles, describing them as “floury roots of good flavor, a gift very acceptable to Indians and a dainty dish even for a Spaniard.” This early endorsement didn’t help much in the long run. No one knows exactly when potatoes were first planted in Spain, but in 1573 records from a hospital in Seville indicate that sacks of potatoes were ordered for provisions. However, initial curiosity for this botanical novelty was soon replaced with scorn and disdain. The tuber—a member of the largely poisonous nightshade family long associated with witchcraft—was generally deemed unfit for human consumption and relegated to the role of animal fodder and sustenance for the starving. In Spain, large-scale cultivation of potatoes didn’t take off until the mid-eighteenth century, pioneered in Galicia and the Canary Islands. But once Spaniards finally fell in love with it, there was no looking back. Today, Spain boasts more different potato recipes than any country I know, most of them scrumptious.</p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>“LASAÑA” DE PATATAS CON CHORIZO Y DATILES</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">The combination of chorizo and dates is truly ingenious; the dried fruit tempers the bold flavors of the sausage and contributes an unexpected sweet touch. Throw in potatoes and piquillo peppers and you have a small masterpiece. This layered dish is my riff on a recipe I came across in a cookbook from La Rioja dedicated to modern cooking. You can serve it as a luncheon main course, with a green salad, or as a hearty appetizer. Accompanied by poached or fried eggs, it makes a stellar brunch dish. The chorizo and date mixture is also excellent as a filling for pastry puffs or small empanadas.</p>
<p class="uln1"><a id="page_322"/><strong>2½ pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled</strong></p>

<p class="uln"><strong>⅔ cup chicken stock or broth</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>7 large pitted dates, finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 to 14 ounces sweet Spanish-style chorizo sausage, casings removed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size garlic cloves, crushed with a garlic press</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>9 to 10 piquillo peppers (from a can or jar), or 3 to 4 large roasted pimientos, cut into strips</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon smoked sweet Spanish paprika</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the potatoes in a large pot, add enough cold salted water to cover by 2 inches, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, partially covered, until the potatoes feel almost tender but still offer a little resistance when pierced with a skewer, 20 to 30 minutes, depending on their size. Drain and let cool until manageable.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> While the potatoes are cooking, place ⅓ cup of the chicken stock in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat, add the dates, and let soak for about 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the chorizo, mashing it up thoroughly with a sturdy fork. Cook the chorizo, breaking it up, until it is no longer raw, 5 to 6 minutes. As you cook, tilt the skillet and spoon off and discard the fat and liquid. Add the dates and their soaking liquid, reduce the heat to medium-high, and continue stirring until the soaking liquid is almost absorbed, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chorizo mixture to a food processor and puree until medium-fine.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 375°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Generously brush a 10-inch cast-iron skillet or a similar-size baking dish with olive oil. Place the remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil in a small bowl and stir in the garlic. Using a long, sharp knife, slice the potatoes as thin as you can, dipping the knife in cold water for easier slicing. Arrange half of the potato slices in slightly overlapping concentric circles on the bottom of the skillet. They should cover it completely. Lightly season the potatoes with salt and black pepper and brush them generously with some of the garlic oil. Scatter half of the piquillo pepper strips over the potatoes and spread the chorizo mixture evenly on top. Arrange the remaining potatoes in a layer on the chorizo, brush generously with some of the garlic oil, and season with salt and pepper. Decorate the top with the remaining piquillo peppers. Pour the remaining ⅓ cup chicken stock over the potatoes, cover them tightly with aluminum foil, and bake until the potatoes are very tender, 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Increase the oven temperature to 450°F. Stir the paprika into the remaining garlic oil. Uncover the potatoes and brush them with the paprika oil, taking care not to disturb the arrangement of peppers. Bake the “lasagna” until the top is lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Let the “lasagna” cool for about 5 minutes, cut it into wedges, and serve. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6</strong></span></p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>PATATAS REVOLCONAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">The word <em>revolconas</em> means tumbled, or rolled over, and here it probably refers to the act of mashing up the potatoes. The dish is a specialty of Extremadura (as well as parts of Castile), where the potatoes are mixed with oil flavored with garlic and the local paprika, <em>pimentón de la Vera</em> (see <a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#page_84">page 84</a>). This gives the dish a rusty hue and an addictively dusky taste. Bacon or chorizo bits are sometimes mixed in as well. After being mashed, the potatoes are shaped into a cake and served as an appetizer (or a poor man’s main dish), though they definitely make a welcome side dish. Smoked <em>pimentón</em> is essential here; it is available at better food shops and by mail order (see <a class="nounder" href="app04.html#page_461">page 461</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">To accommodate the realities of working women, more and more stalls at Barcelona’s La Boqueria market are devoting space to prepared foods. The perennial local favorite is waxy yellow potatoes mixed with a green vegetable, such as beans or Swiss chard, and dressed with aromatic olive oil.

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>PATATAS ARRUGADAS CON MOJO PICON</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">A specialty of the Canary Islands, this dish uses one of the niftiest techniques for cooking potatoes. Boiled with a large amount of salt—originally sea water was used—the potatoes are drained, then returned to the pot to be cooked some more. This makes them a bit wrinkled and lightly coated with residual salt, for a flavor that’s punchy but not overly salty. The classic accompaniment is a ruddy <em>mojo</em> of pounded chiles, herbs, and vinegar. It’s addictive as a tapa or a side dish for a simple grill.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE MOJO PICON:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 medium-size garlic cloves, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small dried red chile, such as arbol, crumbled</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons sweet (not smoked) paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ teaspoon dried oregano</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large pinch of coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 tablespoons best-quality red wine vinegar, or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE POTATOES:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ pounds small white new potatoes, well rinsed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅔ cup coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Make the <em>mojo picon</em>: Place the garlic, chile, paprika, oregano, cumin seeds, and parsley in a mortar and, using a pestle, mash to a paste, adding the salt and a little of the olive oil. Scrape the <em>mojo</em> into a bowl and stir in the remaining olive oil, the vinegar, and 2 tablespoons water. Taste for seasoning, adding more vinegar or salt if necessary, then set the <em>mojo</em> aside. (The texture is preferable when made in a mortar, but the ingredients can also be coarsely pureed in a mini food processor; add the 2 tablespoons water at the beginning.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Prepare the potatoes: Place the potatoes in a large, wide pot. Add the salt and cold water to cover by 3 inches. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer, partially covered, until just tender when tested with a skewer, about 15 minutes. Drain the potatoes, leaving them slightly damp, and return them to the pot. Cook the potatoes, uncovered, over medium-low heat, shaking the pan frequently, until they are dry and lightly wrinkled, 10 to 12 minutes, lowering the heat if necessary. The potatoes will be slightly white from the salt. Arrange the potatoes on a platter and serve with the <em>mojo</em> on the side. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4 TO 6</strong></span></p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>PATATAS RELLENAS DE BRANDADA DE BACALAO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">This recipe is my trophy from a saint’s day fair in the Catalan Pyrenees. Anywhere in the world you go these days, you find baked potatoes with toppings. But these, prepared by a group of village women, were in a class of their own. Stuffed with salt cod and potato puree, and capped with <em>allioli,</em> the Catalan garlic mayonnaise, the result was earthy and wonderful. I like to use small to medium-size baking potatoes and serve them as a substantial tapa or as part of a buffet. Larger potatoes would make an excellent luncheon main course.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>6 smallish baking potatoes (about 6 ounces each), scrubbed and patted dry</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 ounces salt cod, soaked and cooked (see <a class="nounder" href="ch07.html#page_198">page 198</a>), then drained</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup whole milk</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size garlic cloves, crushed with a garlic press</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About ¼ cup Allioli (<a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_44">page 44</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup plain bread crumbs or Parmesan cheese, or ¼ cup of each, for topping the potatoes</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 425°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Prick the potatoes all over with a fork, wrap each one in aluminum foil, and place on a baking sheet. Bake until the potatoes feel completely tender when pierced with a skewer, about 1¼ hours. Let cool in the aluminum foil just until cool enough to handle. Increase the oven temperature to 475°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Meanwhile, tear the salt cod into small pieces, removing and discarding any bones and hard bits.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Heat the milk, olive oil, and garlic in a small saucepan over medium-high heat until it’s just simmering, or microwave it on high power for 2 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Place the salt cod and the hot milk in a food processor and pulse until a medium-smooth puree forms. Scrape the puree into a bowl.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Unwrap the potatoes, cut them in half lengthwise, and carefully remove the flesh, leaving the skin intact. Mash about half of the potato pulp and stir it into the salt cod mixture. Taste the mixture and if you would like it a little more “potatoey,” mash a little more potato and stir it in. The flavors of salt cod and potatoes should be nicely balanced (set the remaining potato flesh aside for another use).</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">7.</span></strong> Fill the potato shells with the salt cod mixture, smear some <em>allioli</em> on each potato, and lightly sprinkle 2 teaspoons bread crumbs, Parmesan, or a mix of both over each.

<p class="box-title">QUIXOTE’S CUISINE</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Thus begins <em>Don Quixote,</em> Miguel de Cervantes’ tale about the misadventures of a delusional knight and his squire, Sancho Panza. First published in 1605, <em>Don Quixote</em> is considered by most literary scholars as the first modern novel. Among the book’s countless virtues are detailed descriptions of seventeenth-century Castilian food. In fact, from the book’s second sentence we learn that three quarters of Quixote’s income was consumed by the following diet:</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• “An <em>olla,</em> or stew, of rather more beef than mutton” (mutton was considered more tender and prized at the time)</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• <em>“Salpicón”</em> (cold beef salad presumably made with leftover meat from the <em>olla</em> and seasoned with onions and vinegar) “on most nights”</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• <em>“Duelos y quebrantos</em> on Saturdays” (the dish, which translates as pain and sorrow, baffles Cervantes scholars, but it was most likely an omelet filled with brains, brains being one of the animal parts permitted to be eaten on Saturdays, a day of semiabstinence)</p>
<p class="sb-bullet">• “Lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra on Sundays”</p>
<p class="sb-indent1">To anyone living in Cervantes’ time, Quixote’s eating regimen was an indication of the knight’s modest means. References to food—much of it comically dire—abound in the novel. Some literary critics suggest that malnutrition and perpetual hunger might well have been the cause of Quixote’s hallucinations. One gastronomic highlight, however, is a wedding feast attended by Quixote and Sancho. The first thing Sancho sees is an entire ox spitted on a whole elm tree. There are also vast wineskins filled with generous wines, hares and fowls hanging from tree branches (to keep them cool), a wall made of cheese, and giant cauldrons of oil from which fritters are taken out with two mighty shovels. “Of cooks and cook-maids there were over fifty, all clean, brisk, and blithe,” Cervantes recounts. In the capacious belly of an ox hide a dozen soft little suckling pigs, sewn up inside to give them flavor and tenderness.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Not able to bear the sight of these temptations, gluttonous Sancho approaches one of the cooks and begs permission to soak a bread in one of the pots. The magnanimous cook responds by skimming off three hens and two geese for him.</p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>BRAZO DE GITANO DE PATATA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent"><em>Brazo de gitano,</em> or gypsy’s arm, is the picturesque Spanish term for a jelly roll. Most are sponge cake–based sweets, but there are some deliciously savory versions. In this recipe, a mashed potato roll encloses all kinds of things dear to the Spanish palate: anchovies, good canned tuna, red peppers, and olives. The dish is a tad kitschy—the Spanish equivalent of a tuna casserole or <em>vitello tonnato</em>—but so good, it’s impossible not to love. Serve it as a substantial tapa or a light main course at an alfresco luncheon.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE POTATOES:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 pounds medium-size Yukon Gold potatoes, unpeeled</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons milk</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>FOR THE ROLL:</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 ounces imported solid oil-packed tuna, or 1 can (6 ounces) Bumble Bee tonno in olive oil, drained and flaked</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size tomato, finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup sliced pimiento-stuffed olives, plus more for decorating the roll</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 to 7 piquillo peppers (from a can or jar), or 3 to 4 pimientos, drained and slivered, plus more slivers for decorating the roll</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 to 10 best-quality oil-packed anchovy fillets, drained and chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup minced fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ tablespoons sherry vinegar, preferably aged</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup mayonnaise (preferably Hellmann’s)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large garlic clove, crushed with a garlic press</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Make the potatoes: Place the potatoes in a medium-size saucepan, add enough cold water to cover by 2 inches, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, partially covered, until the potatoes feel completely tender when pierced with a skewer, about 30 minutes. Drain the potatoes. When just cool enough to handle, peel the potatoes, add the milk and olive oil, and mash until fairly smooth. Season with salt to taste.</p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_329"/><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Prepare the roll: Place a 15-inch piece of waxed paper on a large baking sheet and oil it lightly. Spread the mashed potatoes on the waxed paper in a thin rectangle approximately 15 by 12 inches. Evenly scatter the tuna, tomato, olives, piquillo peppers, anchovies, and parsley all over the rectangle. Season with salt and pepper, then sprinkle the vinegar on top. Starting at a long end, roll the potatoes up jelly-roll fashion, using the waxed paper to shape the roll without catching the edge of the waxed paper in it. When the roll is finished, slide the waxed paper out from under it. If the potatoes tear in places, mend the holes by pinching the potatoes back together.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place the mayonnaise, olive oil, lemon juice, and garlic in a small bowl. Whisk to mix, then season with salt to taste. Spread the mayonnaise all over the roll and decorate it with piquillo pepper slivers and olive slices. Place the roll in the refrigerator and chill for 2 to 3 hours. To serve, cut the roll into thick slices. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4 TO 6</strong></span></p>
