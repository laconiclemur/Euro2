<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">A</span><small>COUPLE YEARS AGO</small>, I was asked to help roast four pigs. But not in someone’s backyard for a barbecue. No, this was roasting four pigs, each in its own <i>caja china</i>, on the rooftop of the Marriott Marquis hotel in New York for the James Beard Awards.</p>
<p class="indent">We cut our timing really close—so close that we ended up having to wheel the pigs into the hotel ballroom during the reception, ashes flying everywhere, saying, “Excuse me, please!” to people in tuxedos and fancy dresses. I remember pushing one of the roasting boxes into the room and seeing Eric Ripert, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Michelle Bernstein, Aarón Sanchez—all heroes of mine. It was already special to be asked to cook for people you admire. But to actually get to see them? It was a night I’ll never forget.</p>
<p class="indent">I’ve since come to know some of my chef heroes as friends, and one of the many things we have in common is that we love roasting pigs. It’s amazing what something as simple as heat can do. It probably won’t surprise you that I’m a fan of all parts of the pig: the ribs, belly, loin, chops, shoulder. I like it roasted, fried, braised, cured—you name it, I’ll eat it. Hope you will, too. And for the ambitious, I’ve included a recipe in this chapter that I hope will encourage you to roast a whole pig and share it with friends and family.</p>

<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>1.</b></span> Preheat oven to 350°F.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>2.</b></span> Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Score the top of the slab bacon <span class="font">⅛</span> inch deep and ¾ inch apart.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>3.</b></span> Sear the bacon slab in the hot oil, scored side down, for 3 minutes on both sides, or until golden brown and crispy. Remove bacon from the pot and set aside.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>4.</b></span> Reduce heat to medium, and sweat the onions for 2–3 minutes, or until soft and translucent. Add garlic and sauté for 2 minutes.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>5.</b></span> Stir in mustard, thyme, and bay leaf. Add chicken broth and bring to a slight boil.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>6.</b></span> Return seared bacon to pot, cover with lid, and braise in the oven for 1 hour. The bacon will become soft and plump.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>7.</b></span> Remove from the oven and let bacon cool in the liquid for 10 minutes. Lower oven temperature to 300°F.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>8.</b></span> Remove bacon from the liquid and refrigerate the bacon for 20 minutes. When cooled, slice into four equal pieces. Pat dry with a paper towel to remove any excess moisture.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>9.</b></span> Heat 6 cups of canola oil in an electric deep fryer to 350°F. If you do not have an electric fryer, use a heavy-bottomed pot and a candy thermometer.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>10</b>.</span> Set up the breading station with three separate shallow bowls for flour, beaten egg, and bread crumbs.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>11</b>.</span> Dredge each bacon slice in the flour, then egg, then the bread crumbs. Patting the bread crumbs on the bacon will ensure they stick.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>12.</b></span> Gently drop each piece of breaded bacon into the oil and fry for 3–4 minutes or until the breading is crispy and golden brown. Remove from fryer and drain on paper towels. Transfer to a baking sheet and keep warm in the oven until ready to serve.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>13.</b></span> To poach the eggs, bring a medium saucepan of water to a simmer (around 185°F) and add vinegar. Vinegar helps keep the egg together while it’s poaching and helps the white of the egg encase the yolk.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>14</b>.</span> Crack each egg into a small dish to have more control of the egg as you release it into the water to poach. Before adding the egg to the pan, stir the water in one direction to create a whirlpool, then gently slide the egg into the water. The whirlpool will hold the egg together and allow the white to encase the yolk. Repeat with a second egg and let them poach for 2–2½ minutes until the whites are cooked and the yolks are warm and runny.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>15</b>.</span> Carefully lift the eggs out of the water with a slotted spoon, and pat the bottom of the spoon with a paper towel to remove any excess water. Set aside on a plate.</p>
<p class="step"><span class="color"><b>16</b>.</span> Repeat step 14 with the remaining 2 eggs and set aside with the first 2 poached eggs.</p>
