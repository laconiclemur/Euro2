</div>
<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">This is an earthy, strong-flavored dish that is served as a first or main course. By tradition, the potatoes are cut only halfway through with a wide knife, then snapped apart by twisting the blade—this is meant to release more starch so as to make the sauce thicker and also to allow the potatoes to absorb more flavor. Small pork ribs, shallow-fried or roasted in the oven, are sometimes added to make this a meatier dish. It is usual to add</span> pimentón, <span class="italic">but I did not add any, as there was enough</span> pimentón <span class="italic">from the chorizo; taste and see what you think. Soft semi-cured or fully cured chorizo can be used.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 2 AS A MAIN COURSE; 3 TO 4 AS A STARTER</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 large onion, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">3 to 4 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">7 ounces cured or semi-cured spicy chorizo, cut into ½-inch-thick slices</p>
<p class="qun">2 garlic cloves, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">1 pound new potatoes, peeled and cut into 1- to 1½-inch pieces</p>
<p class="qun">½ to 1 teaspoon <span class="italic">pimentón dulce</span> (or sweet paprika; optional)</p>
<p class="qun1">Salt</p>
<p class="recsum">Sauté the onion in the oil over low heat in a wide skillet, stirring often, for 20 minutes or longer, until it is really brown, almost caramelized. Add the chorizo and garlic and cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes. Add the potatoes and cook for 5 minutes, turning them over.</p>
<p class="summary">Add the <span class="italic">pimentón</span> if desired and salt to taste, then pour in enough water to cover. Simmer over low heat for about 25 to 35 minutes, until the potatoes are tender and the liquid is very much reduced, turning the potatoes if necessary so that they are well cooked all the way through. You should be left with a sizzling sauce that coats the potatoes and chorizos. If there is too much liquid, increase the heat and let it bubble away.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATIONS</span></p>
<p class="bl-first">• Chop ½ green and ½ red bell pepper, add them when the onion is soft, and continue to cook until the pepper is lightly browned and the onion is well browned.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• Add 1 tomato, peeled and chopped, to the fried onion.</p>
<p class="bl-last">• Add a whole dried or fresh chile pepper to the onion.</p>
