<p class="summary"><span class="bi">One of the pleasures of life in Spain is the tapas tradition: visiting</span> bars and meeting friends before lunch or dinner for a glass of wine, beer, or sherry accompanied by little plates of food. You meet, chat, and have fun. My friend Alicia remembers the time, not long ago, when women would always hurry back home after church to prepare lunch while the men got together at the local bars, drinking and eating tapas as they waited for the meal to be ready. Now the women go too.</p>
<p class="summary">Some large cities, like Seville, San Sebastián, Barcelona, and Madrid, have “tapas zones”—streets packed with <span class="italic">tabernas,</span> also known as <span class="italic">tascas,</span> where you eat and drink standing up, and bars and <span class="italic">cervecerías</span> (beer houses), where you can sit down. It is usual to go on a <span class="italic">tapeo,</span> or tapas crawl, from one place to another. The bars get so full that patrons spill out into the street. In Basque cities, the tradition of moving from bar to bar with friends is called <span class="italic">poteo,</span> from <span class="italic">potes,</span> the heavy wineglasses once used in the area, or <span class="italic">txikiteo,</span> after the coin that once represented the price of a glass of wine.</p>
<p class="summary">Tapas originated in Andalusia, and Seville is the capital where the custom is supposed to have begun. The word <span class="italic">tapa,</span> which means “cover” or “lid,” is said to have referred in early days to the slice of ham or cheese that was laid across the tops of narrow sherry glasses, <span class="italic">cañas,</span> by innkeepers when they handed them to stagecoach drivers—to keep them sober and, it is said, to keep insects out of the wine. The salty tidbits also kept clients thirsty.</p>
<p class="summary">The world of tapas is complex. The simplest are the <span class="italic">tentempiés</span>—nibbles such as olives, fried almonds, fried peppers <span class="italic">del Padrón,</span> bits of cheese, slices of <span class="italic">jamón,</span> sausages. Standard tapas include potato omelets cut into little squares, croquettes, baby eels sizzling with garlic, fried squid, prawns fried with garlic and parsley, small deep-fried fish, grilled blood sausage, chorizo cooked in wine or cider, boiled octopus with potatoes, meatballs in a sauce, mushrooms with garlic, oxtail stew, chickpea and bean stews, and <span class="italic">empanadillas</span> (little savory pies). Some bars specialize in certain kinds of tapas, and every region has its own specialties: in the north, it is seafood; on the Mediterranean coast, it is vegetables; and in the south, it is deep-fried fish.</p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Raciones</span> are larger portions of tapas that are meant to be shared. <span class="italic">Cazuelas</span> are stews and foods with a sauce that are served in small earthenware dishes of the same name. In the north of Spain, there are <span class="italic">pinchos,</span> bite-size offerings on toothpicks. If the toothpicks are wrapped in colored paper, looking like the barbed batons used in bullfights, the tapas are called <span class="italic">banderillas</span>. <span class="italic">Montaditos</span> are canapés on toast or savory tartlets. Some bars in San Sebastián and Bilbao offer <span class="italic">modern</span> creative upscale <span class="italic">pinchos</span> (<span class="italic">pintxos</span> in Basque) such as tartlets of foie gras with sautéed apple and Calvados, fried Moroccan <span class="italic">brik</span> (little savory parcels wrapped in paper-thin pastry), and blood sausage <span class="italic">caramelos</span> wrapped like bonbons in filo pastry. It is usual for <span class="italic">pinchos</span> to be set out on the bar counter for patrons to help themselves.</p>

<p class="summary">Tapas belong to the world of bars and taverns—people do not serve tapas at home. Instead, they offer <span class="italic">aperitivos</span> before a meal. These consist of foods that don’t need to be cooked. In the past, during long formal meals both at home and in elegant restaurants, platters of cured ham, sausage, olives, and other foods were left on the table throughout the meal for people to nibble on between courses. Today the usual appetizers offered with drinks before a meal, apart from bread with tomato (page 154), which is de rigueur in Catalonia and Majorca, are platters of charcuterie with bread. Platters of preserved fish and seafood or a few cheeses are sometimes offered. There may also be olives, fried salted almonds, and pickled vegetables in brine or in olive oil. It has become fashionable in America to entertain casually by serving four or five cooked dishes laid out like tapas on the table at the same time. You will find inspiration for these throughout the book, but if you want to follow the Spanish way, here are some ideas to inspire you.</p>
