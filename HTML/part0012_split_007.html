  <p class="chap-para">This recipe evolved from memories of a pasta dish I once enjoyed in Sicily. To the pesto of almonds and olives, I added a hint of <a id="pg120" class="calibre1"></a>cinnamon, giving it that subtle North African flavour which is so often present in Sicilian dishes. Once the pesto is inserted into the beef, the meat is left to slow cook in stock. Delicious served with couscous or steamed rice.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">70g/2½oz green olives, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">70g/2½oz flaked almonds, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">½ tsp ground cinnamon</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">800g/1lb 12oz beef brisket</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 onion, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 garlic clove, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">a handful of parsley, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 tbsp tomato purée (paste)</p>

  <p class="ing1">100ml/3½fl oz/scant ½ cup red wine</p>

  <p class="ing2">700ml/1¼ pints/3 cups hot <a href="part0007_split_005.html#pg21" class="calibre1">beef stock</a> – or use a stock cube</p>

  <p class="para">Combine the olives, almonds, cinnamon, salt and pepper. Make incisions all over the beef with a skewer or sharp knife and insert the mixture well inside, also placing some between the meat and the outer fat; if the filling looks as though it might fall out, tie the meat securely with kitchen string.</p>

  <p class="para">Heat the olive oil in a flameproof pot and brown the beef on all sides. Add the onion, garlic and parsley and sweat for a couple of minutes. Mix the tomato purée with the wine and add to the meat, together with the stock. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat, cover with a lid and cook gently for 3 hours, until the meat is tender and cooked through.</p>

  <p class="para">Remove the meat and set aside. Increase the heat and cook the sauce for a few minutes, without a lid, until it has reduced and thickened slightly. Slice the meat and serve with the sauce, and a dish of couscous or rice.</p>
