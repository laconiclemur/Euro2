<p class="normalla0"><em>The tiny fish used for the soup – known as</em> soupe <em>or</em> soupe de poisson – <em>are smaller versions of the</em> rascasses, <em>weavers and John Dories used in the bouillabaisse itself</em>.</p>
<div class="hang0">

<div class="hang00a">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">MARINADE</span><br/>
1 bouquet wild fennel, chopped<br/>
½ tsp powdered saffron<br/>
4 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped<br/>
8 tbsp olive oil</p>
</div>
<div class="hang00a">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FISH SOUP</span><br/>
2 large onions, peeled and sliced<br/>
1 head of garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped<br/>
1 large fennel bulb, sliced<br/>
5 tbsp olive oil<br/>
3 tomatoes, quartered<br/>
1kg (2lb 4oz) <em>soupe</em> (tiny, whole ungutted rockfish)<br/>
500g (1lb 2oz) conger eel, cut into small pieces<br/>
10 small, live crabs (<em>favouilles</em> or <em>étrilles</em>)</p>
</div>
<div class="hang00a">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">ROUILLE</span><br/>
2 <em>rascasse</em> livers, poached in a little hot fish soup for 1 minute<br/>
3 garlic cloves, peeled<br/>
1 large egg yolk<br/>
Large pinch of salt<br/>
Large pinch of cayenne pepper<br/>
250g (9oz) fresh breadcrumbs<br/>
½ tsp saffron threads, dissolved in 4 tbsp hot fish soup<br/>
400ml (14fl oz) olive oil, at room temperature</p>
</div>
<div class="hang00">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">TO FINISH</span><br/>
8 medium new potatoes, peeled and sliced 2cm (¾ in) thick<br/>
1 large onion, peeled and sliced as finely as possible<br/>
3 Roma tomatoes, seeded<br/>
5 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped<br/>
Bouquet of fennel stalks<br/>
½ tsp saffron threads<br/>
1kg (2lb 4oz) mussels, debearded and well rinsed<br/>
Croûtons made from a large baguette</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Scale, gut and rinse the fish and spread them out on a tray. Sprinkle over the fennel, saffron, garlic and olive oil. Turn the fish a few times with your hands to make sure that they are well coated with oil and that the other ingredients are evenly distributed. Leave to marinate while you prepare the soup and the <em>rouille</em>.</p>
<p class="normala">For the fish soup, sweat the onion, garlic and fennel bulb in the olive oil until softened and translucent but not coloured. Add the tomatoes, fish and conger eel. Raise the heat and stir for about 5 minutes until the fish begins to break up. Pour over enough water to cover, bring to the boil and add the crabs. Bring back to the boil for 25 minutes, topping up with water if necessary. Pour the soup through a colander bit by bit, bashing the crabs and fish with a pestle then pressing down well to extract the maximum of liquid and flavour. Discard each pile of debris before doing the next lot. When you have done it all, strain the liquid through a fine sieve and set aside.</p>
<p class="normala">For the <em>rouille</em>, pound the <em>rascasse</em> livers and garlic to a smooth paste in a mortar. Add the egg yolk, a little salt, a good pinch of cayenne, the breadcrumbs and saffron mixture. Mash to a thick paste then add the olive oil very slowly as for a mayonnaise.</p>
<p class="normala">To finish and serve, reheat the fish soup, add the potato, onion, tomato, garlic, fennel and saffron, and return to the boil. Boil for 5 minutes and add the monkfish. Simmer for 5 minutes, then add the other fish and simmer for 15 minutes. Add the mussels and boil for 5 minutes until they all open (discard any that remain closed). With a large wire spider, lift the fish, mussels and vegetables on to a large heated serving dish (cork if you have it). Ladle some of the broth into a large heated soup tureen, leaving some in the pot for a second serving. You can then serve all at once to be passed around, or you can serve the soup first with the croûtons and <em>rouille</em> and keep the fish, vegetables and mussels warm to serve afterwards with a little of the soup thickened with <em>rouille</em>.</p>
