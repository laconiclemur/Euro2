<p class="author1"><span class="txit">spezzatino di vitello</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">My mother created this stew, which is a perfect dish to serve on cold autumn and winter evenings. Double the recipe when you need to feed a large group or if you want to have some on reserve in the freezer where it will keep, stored in an airtight container, for up to three months. Like most stews, this recipe is best when cooked a day in advance, then warmed up slowly before serving. Polenta, plain fettuccine, or egg noodles make a good bed for the stew.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Place the veal and flour in a large bowl or sealable plastic bag. Shake to coat the veal lightly with the flour. Toss the meat in a strainer to remove any excess flour. In a deep flameproof casserole, warm the olive oil over medium heat. Cook the veal in the oil, a few pieces at a time, browning on all sides, about 5 minutes per batch. Remove the cooked pieces to a plate and reserve.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_262"/><span class="red">2.</span> When all the veal has been browned and removed from the casserole, reduce the heat to medium-low and add the sliced onions and the garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, about 1 minute. Add 1 cup of the wine and stir, scraping the bottom of the pan clean.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Return the veal to the pan, along with any juices that have accumulated on the plate. Add the remaining 1 cup wine, the marinara sauce, onions, thyme, rosemary, sage, and bay leaf. Season with salt and pepper. The veal should be immersed in liquid; add more wine if necessary. Cover the pan and simmer the stew over low heat, stirring frequently, about 30 to 45 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Add the potatoes and carrots, cover, and continue simmering until the vegetables are tender but not mushy, about 50 minutes. Stir the stew frequently, making sure that none of the meat is sticking to the bottom of the pan. Remove the cover and stir in the peas. Simmer until they are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. (The stew may be set aside before adding the peas. Refrigerate overnight. Reheat slowly, stirring frequently, before adding the peas.)</p>
