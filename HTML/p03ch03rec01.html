<p class="summary1">Choose two or more of the following. Take them out of the fridge about 20 minutes before they are to be eaten, so they can come to room temperature. Serve them with a sliced baguette or other good bread. For more about the cured hams, see page 163; for more about sausages, see page 492.</p>
<p class="bl-first">• <span class="italic">Jamón serrano</span>—the name means ham “from the mountain,” or <span class="italic">sierra,</span> where it is dry, cool, and breezy enough to air-cure it.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• <span class="italic">Jamón ibérico</span> is dry-cured ham from the native Iberian black pig. The quality <span class="italic">de bellota,</span> produced from pigs fed on acorns, or <span class="italic">bellotas</span> (see page 164), is the best in the world, with a fabulous taste and aroma and a soft, silky texture. It is extremely expensive.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• <span class="italic">Lomo</span> is dry-cured pork loin, trimmed of fat, marinated in a paste of garlic, <span class="italic">pimentón,</span> oregano, and olive oil, and encased in a sausage skin.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• <span class="italic">Chorizo</span> is a brownish-red cured pork sausage flavored with garlic and <span class="italic">pimentón.</span> There are infinite regional variations: thin or fat, sweet or spicy, coarse or smooth-textured, air-dried or smoked, cured or semi-cured. Choose one that does not need to be cooked.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• <span class="italic">Salchichón</span> is a hard salami-type sausage. The best are produced around the Catalan town of Vic, seasoned simply with salt and pepper. There is also one with wine and one with local black truffles. <span class="italic">Fuet,</span> from Vic, is a thin small <span class="italic">salchichón</span>.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• <span class="italic">Sobrasada,</span> a specialty of Majorca, is a very soft red paste of pork and fat, flavored with garlic and <span class="italic">pimentón,</span> encased in a sausage skin. It can be spread on slices of dense bread and is good accompanied by <span class="italic">membrillo</span> (quince paste), <span class="italic">fruta confitada</span> (crystallized fruit), or sliced figs or grapes. When it is good it is great, but I have tried some that are not worth eating.</p>
<p class="bl-last">• <span class="italic">Cecina,</span> salt-cured beef with lacy fat, has a strong meaty flavor. Once the food of the rural poor, when it was made from the meat of cattle, goats, horses, or mules that had died on the farm, it is now a great delicacy, produced exclusively from high-quality beef. It should be sliced paper-thin.</p>
