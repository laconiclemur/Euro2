			<p class="rec-intro">Rich and delicious, this is one of the first duck dishes to appear on the menu at Le Gavroche. The duck is served two ways – first the breast, very rare and tender, and then the well-cooked duck legs. </p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 2</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 large carrot</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 large turnips </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">3 tbsp unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">600ml duck stock (see <a href="part0010_split_004.html#duck-stock" class="calibre4">here</a>)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">vegetable oil</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 Challans duck (or any good-quality free-range duck), wishbone and winglets removed and set aside</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 shallots, peeled</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">100g duck liver</p>

			<p class="body">Peel the carrot and turnips, then trim and turn them into 2 small barrel shapes (see<a href="part0010_split_038.html#Chef-s-notes"> here</a>) per person. Julienne the rest – keep the trimmings. Cook the barrels in a small pan with a tablespoon of butter and a little water and salt until tender and glazed, then set aside. Cook the julienne vegetables in another tablespoon of butter and 4 tablespoons of the duck stock. Season and cook until the vegetables are glazed and the liquid is reduced by half. </p>
			<p class="body">Preheat the oven to 220°C/Fan 200°C/Gas 7. Heat a little oil in a roasting pan on the hob, season the duck cavity, then colour the duck on all sides. Add the vegetable trimmings, a roughly chopped shallot and the duck winglets. Place the pan in the preheated oven with the duck breast-side up and roast for 20 minutes. Remove and put the duck on a rack breast-side down so that the juices flow into the breast. Leave to rest for 10 minutes.</p>
			<p class="body">Add a good drop of vegetable oil to a very hot frying pan and add the cleaned and trimmed liver, the foie gras and the remaining chopped shallot. Season well and cook for about 2 minutes – the livers should still be very pink. Immediately place them all on a drum sieve and press through, adding the fat and juices that have run from the roast duck. Collect the purée in a small pan and whisk well with a little of the duck stock to make a thick creamy sauce. Warm gently before serving, but do not overheat or it will go grainy. </p>
			<p class="body">Put the roasting pan back on the hob and heat to caramelise the contents.Add the port and the rest of the stock , then simmer for 10 minutes. Pass the sauce through a fine sieve, then pour it back into the pan and reduce to the desired consistency. Whisk in the remaining tablespoon of cold butter. </p>
			<p class="body">Remove the legs from the duck, place them in a pan skin-side up and roast in a preheated oven, at 220°C/Fan 200°C/Gas 7, for about 15 minutes or until well done and crispy. Remove the breasts from the carcass and peel off the skin. Trim off any sinew and fat, then cut each breast diagonally into 5 slices, keeping the shape of the breast. Place the duck on a hot plate and spoon over the liver purée. Serve with the hot vegetables and sauce, then bring out the hot crispy legs and serve on a bed of watercress and a little duck sauce. </p>
