    <p class="nonindent">When I am hiking in the <span class="small1">ABRUZZO</span> national parks, three places I enjoy most are Santo Stefano di Sessanio, Castel del Monte, and Rocca Calascio. Santo Stefano di Sessanio is a town of stark gray stone. The 2009 earthquake caused some damage, but the industrious Abruzzese people are hard at work repairing it. Castel del Monte is a small <em class="calibre4">borgo</em> with a wonderful Baroque church, Madonna del Suffragio, in which the statue of the Madonna wears clothing typical of the area. The ancient fortress atop Rocca Calascio is filled now only with overgrown vegetation, but at the greatest elevation in central Italy—about fifteen hundred meters—it still stands like a crumbling giant on high.</p>

    <p class="extract">If you’re a lover of sweets, it’s worth making a stop at the town of <span class="small1">SULMONA</span>, famous for its candy-coated almonds known as <em class="calibre4">confetti.</em> The sugar-coated almonds were first made by the Clarisse nuns, who lived in the nearby convent of the Church of Santa Chiara. About fifty-four different types of <em class="calibre4">confetti</em> are made, varying from simple sugar-coated, to chocolate-filled, to <em class="calibre4">confetti</em> dipped in gold. My favorite shop is Hansel &amp; Gretel, where the <em class="calibre4">confetti</em> displays are set out as floral arrangements. Be sure to take some home with you!</p>

    <p class="extract">After each saffron harvest, the women of Abruzzo set aside a pouch of saffron and then visit the goldsmith in <span class="small1">SCANNO</span> to barter the saffron for a new piece of jewelry. The town is revered for its gold-filigree work, which is like delicate lace executed in gold. The symbolic jewel of this tradition, the <em class="calibre4">presentosa</em>, is a pendant in the shape of a star with one or two central hearts surrounded by little spirals of filigree.</p>

    <p class="extract"><span class="small1">BOMINACO</span> is not far from the crocus fields of the Navelli plateau, and you can enjoy frescoes inside the oratory of San Pellegrino. Here saints, evangelists, fathers of the church, and zodiacal signs and stories were painted with meticulous attention to detail by anonymous Abruzzese artists (including one of the best Last Judgments I have seen, in which devils eat sinners, sinners are boiled in cauldrons, and the whole scene evokes the rings of Dante’s hell). It is not only the paintings’ striking beauty I enjoy, but also the challenge of identifying who’s who in them.</p>

    <p class="extract">I always stop at the Ducal Palace in <span class="small1">TAGLIACOZZO</span> to look at the late-fifteenth-century frescoes with scenes from Christ’s life. One of my favorite pieces is <em class="calibre4">The Adoration of the Magi</em>, which features the local rulers of the Orsini family and their distinguished relatives all looking elegant in their different poses. Rich in tone, detail, and complexity, these frescoes were most certainly painted by an extremely skilled master, although unattributed.</p>

    <p class="nonindent"><a class="calibre8" id="page262"></a>In <span class="small1">ATRI</span>, a town surrounded by medieval walls, the Church of Santa Maria Assunta houses some of the most important early-Renaissance frescoes in Abruzzo, painted by Andrea De Litio, who eventually left Abruzzo to work in Tuscany. The frescoes are made up of 101 panels, with twenty-six scenes depicting the life of the Virgin Mary and Christ. The more you look at them, the more you appreciate the compulsive amount of detail and the deep quality of expression.—T<span class="small1">ANYA</span></p>
