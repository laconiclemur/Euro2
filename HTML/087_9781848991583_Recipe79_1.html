<p class="normal"><b>This is my alternative to the classic sole meunière, using flounder. The flounder must be in prime condition, and I would recommend your fish merchant skin it for you, because it is fiddly. Celery root is a beautiful vegetable, which I personally love when it’s roasted or, like here, grated with potatoes and mixed with pancetta to make a crisp and golden galette. If you don’t have a pan large enough to cook both flounder at once, cook one, then keep it warm in a 300</b>°<b>F oven while to cook the second. Add extra butter and olive oil to the skillet, if necessary.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 15 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxta"><span class="smallcaps"><b>COOKING TIME</b></span> 30 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 ounces thick pancetta, cut into lardons</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 cups peeled and grated Idaho or other baking potatoes</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 cups peeled and grated celery root</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 stick unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 flounder, skinned and left on the bone</p>
<p class="acktxt">finely grated zest and juice of 1 lime</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Heat the oven to 315°F. To make the galette, bring a small saucepan of water to a boil. Add the pancetta and blanch 1 to 2 minutes until just cooked. Drain and refresh the pancetta in cold water, then tip it onto paper towels and pat dry. Mix the potatoes, celery root and pancetta in a bowl with half the parsley and season with pepper.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Melt 1½ tablespoons of the butter with 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large nonstick, ovenproof skillet over medium heat. When the butter is foaming, add the potato mixture and lightly press it down with a spatula into an even layer. Fry it 5 minutes, or until golden brown, then put the pan in the oven 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and put a large plate on top to cover the pan, then carefully turn the pan and plate upsidedown to flip the galette onto the plate. Slide it back into the pan, uncooked side up.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Return the pan to medium heat. Add another 1½ tablespoons of the butter and cook the galette 3 minutes, then return the pan to the oven 3 minutes longer. Slide the galette onto paper towels to drain a few seconds, then wrap in kitchen foil to keep warm while you cook the fish.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Turn the oven up to 350°F. Put the flour on a plate and season with salt and pepper. Dust the fish in the seasoned flour, patting to remove any excess. Melt 1½ tablespoons of the butter with 1 tablespoon of the oil in the cleaned skillet over high heat. When the butter is foaming, add the fish and cook 6 minutes, then turn it over, add another 1½ tablespoons of the butter and, when it melts, spoon it over the fish. Put the pan in the oven 6 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and flakes easily.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> Remove the fish from the oven, cover and leave to rest on a warm plate. Return the skillet to the stovetop, add the remaining butter and oil and stir in the remaining parsley and the lime zest and juice. Heat through briefly. Spoon the sauce over the fish and serve with portions of the galette.</p>
