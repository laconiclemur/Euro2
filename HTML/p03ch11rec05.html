<p class="summary">Spanish saffron is of a very high quality. The little red threads that give a slightly bitter flavor, characteristic aroma, and intense yellow color to paellas and many other dishes are the stigmas of a particular purple crocus, <span class="italic">Crocus sativus</span> (<span class="italic">sativus</span> means “cultivated,” and this crocus does not grow wild). The best quality is Mancha saffron from La Mancha; the Sierra saffron is a lower grade.</p>
<p class="summary">The stigmas, which have to be removed by hand, are dried quickly by very lightly toasting them. Two hundred flowers yield only one gram. The plants do not reproduce from seeds, like wild plants—their tiny corms (they look like, but are not, bulbs) have to be dug up and split up into cormlets and replanted by hand. They remain dormant through the summer months, and the pale purple flowers come out in autumn. They must be harvested at dawn, as soon as they open. The Fiesta de la Rosa del Azafrán (Festival of the Saffron Rose) is a great tourist attraction in Consuegra, in the province of Toledo.</p>
<p class="summary">Spain was once the world’s biggest producer of what was called “the poor man’s gold” (the poor man being the farmer). In the 1970s, about 15,000 acres were under cultivation. But production has decreased so much—because it is so labor-intensive and the price is not competitive on the world market—that there are now only 2,800 acres or so. A few hundred dedicated farmers continue the agricultural practices that began when the Arabs first brought the flowers to Spain. Saffron was a popular flavoring among the Al-Andalus elites. The Spanish name of the spice, <span class="italic">azafrán</span>, is derived from the Arabic. Iranian saffron, which is the biological progenitor of Spanish saffron, is its greatest competitor. Selling at less than half the price, but of the highest quality, Iranian saffron now accounts for more than ninety percent of the market. Some Spanish companies sell Iranian saffron and pass it off as Spanish, a practice that has been in part responsible for Spanish growers giving up.</p>
<p class="summary">Saffron threads keep for years if stored in a cool, dry place and out of direct sunlight. You should use very little—only a pinch for a dish for six. If you use too much, the taste will be bitter. Some people actually count the threads and advise 5 to 6 per serving, but I would not go as far as that, especially since the amount also depends on the dish and serving size, as well as the quality of the saffron. I start with a tiny pinch and then add more to taste if necessary.</p>
<p class="summary">You can simply throw the threads, as they are, into a stock, sauce, soup, or stew. Some cooks heat them first in a small frying pan (or wrapped in a piece of foil placed on a hot pan lid), then crush them with the back of a spoon, to release more flavor. An alternative is to steep the threads in a little boiling water or stock for about 20 minutes. However, I haven’t noticed that either of these procedures makes much difference except perhaps in spreading the color.</p>
<p class="summary">Powdered saffron is much used in Spain—although it has lost most of its flavor and aroma—because it is cheap and gives a dish a good uniform color. It is quickly absorbed and can be thrown into the pot a few minutes before serving. A powdered colorant that contains a yellow dye and no saffron is also used by many people to give a brighter yellow color to rice. Only gourmet purists avoid it.</p>
