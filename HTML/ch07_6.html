<p class="author"><span class="txit">riso e risotto</span></p>
<p class="noindenti"><span class="stickup">T</span>here are three types of rice recipes in this section—those prepared with long-grain or basmati rice, and risottos prepared with Arborio rice. Basmati rice isn’t typically Italian but it is flavorful, especially as prepared in the recipe my mother created and that I share here. Though risotto is now quite popular in this country, this was not true in the 1950s, the period in which <span class="txit">Big Night</span> is set. That is why in one of the first scenes in <span class="txit">Big Night</span> we choose to use risotto metaphorically, as it effectively represented a prejudicial preconception for what “Italian” food really is. Because it is northern Italian in origin and most of the Italians who emigrated to America were from the poorer south, few Americans were familiar with risotto back then.</p>
<p class="indenti">My introduction to risotto was my mother’s risotto Milanese that she would often make when I was young. But I have Gianni Scappin to thank for showing me the finer points of the art of making risotto, beginning with shopping for the correct rice. I look for brands marked superfine Carnaroli. If that is not available, I buy a superfine Arborio rice or Vialone Nano rice, both of which may be found in most supermarkets. The rice <a id="page_188"/>you buy is important because different varieties absorb liquid at different rates. If the rice is still tough after you’ve added all the liquid called for in the recipe, you’ll need to add more, so I recommend having excess hot liquid available. The following risotto recipes call for more liquid than you will most likely use.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two important steps to remember when cooking risotto. First, before adding any liquid make sure to heat the rice well with the onions that are cooked until softened as the first step in these risotto recipes. This will seal the rice grains and helps to keep them from overcooking. Second, test the rice for the desired texture after it has cooked for twelve to fifteen minutes. Risotto may be served al dente, with a slight crispness to the bite, or with a softer consistency—the choice is yours. In Italy they call a risotto of perfect consistency <span class="txit">all’onda,</span> which means “on the wave,” and describes the movement the rice should make as you spoon it onto a plate. Just don’t overcook risotto or it will turn into paste.</p>
<p class="indenti">Preparing risotto requires your focused attention for about twenty minutes, so I like to open a bottle of wine and gather my family and friends around the stove to keep me company while I stir.</p>
