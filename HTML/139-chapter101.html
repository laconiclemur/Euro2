<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">In Spain, scallops are particularly associated with Galicia and the lengthy pilgrimage route, the Camino de Santiago. <em>Peregrinos</em> (pilgrims) symbolically carry a scallop shell on a necklace or fastened to their pack as they walk to Santiago de Compostela. Scallops on the half-shell, sweetened with some tender sautéed onions, moistened with a bit of white wine, sprinkled with breadcrumbs, and slid into the oven, is a superb Galician specialty. A similar treatment is given to smaller, bright orangish red scallops called <em>zamburiñas</em>. (<em>Vieiras</em> have one rounded and one flat shell, while the smaller <em>zamburiñas</em> have two equally rounded shells.) A pinch of finely chopped dry-cured jamón or some sweet pimentón (paprika) will add an interesting touch of flavor. But do not overwhelm the lovely natural taste of the scallops. This serves four as a first course, but you can serve double that number as a rather elegant part of a tapas spread.</span></strong></p>

<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> In a medium skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat and add the onion and a pinch of salt, cooking until soft and translucent, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the wine and cook for 3 minutes to let the alcohol burn off and reduce slightly. The onion should be very moist and juicy. Remove from the heat.</p>

<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> On a baking sheet, arrange the scallops. Spread about 1 tablespoon of the onion inside each shell around the scallop meat. Sprinkle a thin layer of breadcrumbs over top. (Depending on the size of the shell, there may be some of each left over at the end.) Broil until the breadcrumbs are golden, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to plates and serve hot.</p>
