  <p class="chap-para">If you like hazelnuts, you’ll love this tart: ground hazelnuts are used in the pastry and the filling. It’s simple to make but looks and tastes like a tart bought from a top pastry shop. Caramelizing the apricots gives extra flavour and colour. You can make the pastry a day or so in advance and store it in the fridge. The tart is delicious just as it is, or serve with mascarpone cream or good vanilla ice cream.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 6</p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the pastry</p>

  <p class="ing1">250g/9oz/2 cups plain (all-purpose) flour, sifted, plus extra to dust</p>

  <p class="ing1">a pinch of salt</p>

  <p class="ing1">125g/4½ oz/generous ½ cup cold butter cut into small pieces, plus extra to grease</p>

  <p class="ing1">100g/3½oz/½ cup caster (superfine) sugar</p>

  <p class="ing1">50g/1¾oz/⅔ cup ground hazelnuts</p>

  <p class="ing">1 egg yolk</p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the filling</p>

  <p class="ing1">450g/1lb apricots, halved or quartered</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 tbsp caster (superfine) sugar</p>

  <p class="ing1">100g/3½oz/7 tbsp butter, at room temperature</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 eggs</p>

  <p class="ing1">20g/¾oz/1½ tbsp plain (all-purpose) flour, sifted</p>

  <p class="ing1">100g/3½oz/1⅓ cups ground hazelnuts</p>

  <p class="ing2">100g/3½oz/¾ cup icing (confectioners’) sugar</p>

  <p class="para">First make the pastry. Put the flour and salt in a large bowl and rub in the butter until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Mix in the sugar and hazelnuts. Add the egg yolk and 2 tablespoons cold water and work into a smooth dough. Form into a ball, wrap in clingfilm (plastic wrap) and leave to rest in the fridge for at least 20 minutes.</p>

  <p class="para">Preheat the grill (broiler). Put the apricots on a baking sheet, sprinkle with caster sugar and place under the hot grill for about 10 minutes, until caramelized. Set aside.</p>

  <p class="para">Preheat the oven to 170°C/325°F/gas mark 3. Grease a 24cm/9½-inch round tart tin and dust with flour.</p>

  <p class="para">To make the filling, put the butter in a bowl and beat until creamy. Whisk in the eggs one at a time, then whisk in the flour, hazelnuts and icing sugar until smooth and well combined.</p>

  <p class="para1">Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface and line the prepared tin. Add the filling and top with the caramelized apricots. Bake for 45–50 minutes, until golden. Leave to rest for at least 10 minutes, then slice and serve.</p>
