<p class="noindent"><span class="big">T</span>he label “genius” is applied so regularly to Ferran Adrià that it is worth recalling the word’s origins. Long before it referred to a person with extraordinary intellectual or creative ability, “genius” signaled a kind of guardian spirit—sometimes benevolent, sometimes mischievous—who wielded an often disproportionate influence over his charge. This earlier definition seems to me to resolve any doubt over whether the word can in fact be applied to a cook, for, if we consider cuisine to be the charge in question, then Ferran clearly qualifies as both its instigator and its protector. He also, as I hope will be clear by now, embodies a unique brand of creativity. In him, in other words, both definitions of genius are united.</p>
<p class="indent">But this book is not about Adrià’s genius, or at least not primarily. As I explained to him when I first brought up the possibility of this book, I wanted to write about the human side of elBulli. He not only bravely agreed to the prospect but was and continues to be consistently enthusiastic about it, granting me full access to him, his staff, and his kitchen. That access—in the end I spent about seventy days in the kitchen—meant that I witnessed not only the fascinating techniques, precise organization, and spectacular dishes for which he is deservedly renowned but the foibles and occasional failures as well. The portrait of him that emerges is based in part on the perspective of those who work for him, and is therefore necessarily more complicated than often seen. But I hope it is no less admiring; in addition to convincing me of his genius, the time I spent at elBulli <a id="page_280"/>revealed to me the great depth of Ferran’s intelligence and courage. I am truly grateful to him.</p>
<p class="indent">Everyone on the permanent staff at elBulli is so good at what he or she does that each of them qualifies for the label of genius in his or her own right. The multitalented Marc Cuspinera has been unfailingly helpful to me throughout the process of writing this book—from the beginning, when he sent me that first, tentative list of 2009 stagiaires, until just last week, when we filled in a few more blanks in the long history of elBulli’s personnel. So exceptional is the work of Oriol Castro, Eduard Xatruch, and Mateu Casañas that none could ever receive the recognition he deserves, but I’d like to try to start here. On more than one occasion, each of them has made me wonder how it is that a single kitchen could compile such remarkable talent. Juli Soler, elBulli’s co-owner and all-around good guy, and the two Lluíses (Biosca and the astonishingly gracious García) persuaded me that the front of the house is touched by its own genius. And everyone, front or back, including Marga Fuentes, Débora Sánchez, and Eugeni de Diego, not only generously tolerated my presence and answered my questions patiently but made me feel part of the elBulli family. Perhaps no one more than the sommeliers and maître d’s with whom I, with great good luck, was assigned a seat at family meal: Pol Perelló, Ferran Centelles, David Seijas, and David López.</p>
<p class="indent">I’m not sure what the thirty-two stagiaires who showed up at Si Us Plau on June 10 thought of me at that initial encounter—I suspect that, with so many other new things to learn, they barely noticed me at all. But over the course of the season, they kindly accepted my interest in everything from their knife skills to their sex lives, and opened themselves up to what were, I’m sure, at times annoying questions. Some of them risked getting in trouble to show me a particular technique, and many of them gave up an extra hour of sleep to meet me for early morning coffee and interviews at Sant Pau. Without exception, each of them has impressed me with his or her dedication and passion, and I know that I will be following what are sure to be their exciting careers for a long time to come.</p>
<p class="indent">In the course of this research, a number of chefs were kind enough to talk to me about their own experiences as either stagiaires or the bosses of stagiaires: Andoni Luis Aduriz, Juan Mari Arzak, Mario Batali, Claude Bosi, Daniel Boulud, David Chang, Roberto González, Thomas Keller, <a id="page_281"/>Denis Martin, Josean Martínez Alija, Nuno Mendes, Paco Morales, Daniel Patterson, René Redzepi, Paco Roncero, and Pedro Subijana. Dan Barber went further than any of them, not only sharing his own memories and vast knowledge of the culinary world but providing a source of inspiration for which I still don’t thank him enough.</p>
<p class="indent">I owe much to my editor Leslie Meredith for her enthusiasm in this project before it had been drafted and her insight and advice after. Like her assistant, Donna Loffredo, she has helped make the end product markedly better. To David Black, my agent, I am tremendously grateful for both his convivial encouragement and his clear-sighted direction. Andrew Friedman has been both colleague and good friend, generously sharing with me not only some crucial contacts and ideas but, as the accomplished author he is, providing me with some much needed perspective on the daunting process of getting an idea into print.</p>
<p class="indent">I’d also like to thank my colleagues, past and present, at <span class="txit">Time</span> magazine. Although I’ve set foot only once in that office on Sixth Avenue, they have made this freelancer feel a valued part of a great institution. I’ve had such exceptionally good luck in editors that I’ve begun to suspect that, like elBulli itself, the magazine has a genius for attracting talent. In particular, I’d like to thank James Graff, Simon Robinson, Jumana Farouky, and fellow elBulli <span class="txit">aficionado</span>, Howard Chua-Eoan for their encouragement and support.</p>
<p class="indent">Over the many years I’ve known Geoff Pingree, he has consistently believed in me; this book owes much to that faith. I’m also grateful to my siblings, Emily Piassick and Andy Abend, and my parents, to whom this book is dedicated, for the opportunities they created for me and the loving support they continue to give.</p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, I’d like to thank Victoria Burnett, who not only came up with this book’s title but acted as enthusiastic cheerleader in the early days of its germination. Mary Alice Hurvitt has provided decades of friendship and one much needed respite with her lovely family. Amy Serafin was my other great discovery of 2009—a new and lasting friend who, at the last, critical moment, also revealed herself to be an expert editor. And Carolyn Fraser has been many things: soother of nerves, font of ideas, tireless listener, adventurous travel companion, source of much laughter. A woman couldn’t ask for better friends.</p>
