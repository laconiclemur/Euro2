<p class="noindent">There are many people who contribute, often unaware over a period of time, to the writing of a book. For instance, from childhood I grew up around women who were good cooks, who served nutritious and lovingly prepared food. They did not know then, nor did I, that they created memories for future generations.</p>
<p class="indent">Likewise, on my visits to Norway, opportunities to sample the best in traditional Norwegian food created a curiosity in me that also contributed to this book. I wish to thank all the excellent Norwegian cooks who, surely unwittingly, inspired me to keep Norwegian food traditions alive in America.</p>
