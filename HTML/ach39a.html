<h3 class="h3b"><a id="page_78"/>egg tart with spinach and potatoes</h3>
<p class="author1"><span class="txit">tortino di uova, patate e spinaci al forno</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This recipe is a variation on one that Gianni’s father used to make for the patrons of his family-run bar. “He would cut the <span class="txit">tortino</span> into small squares and place it on top of the counter to be eaten as a snack with a glass of wine,” Gianni recalls. “At home it was served to us children as a snack after school along with a slice of bread.” This is scrumptious eaten warm from the oven, at room temperature, or even cold.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 large Yukon Gold potato, peeled</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">8 large eggs</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> pound fresh spinach, stems removed, leaves washed well, coarsely chopped, and blanched in boiling water for 1 minute</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 teaspoons chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon butter</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon canola oil</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Preheat the oven to 375° F.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Place the potato in a pot filled with cold salted water. Bring to a boil and cook the potato until just tender when pierced with a fork, 20 to 25 minutes. Cut the potato in half lengthwise and then into thin half-moon-shaped slices.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> In a medium-size bowl, whisk the eggs until frothy. Squeeze all the water out of the spinach and add to the eggs along with the potato slices, salt and pepper to taste, and the parsley. Stir briskly to incorporate all the ingredients.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_79"/><span class="red">4.</span> Heat a 10- to 12-inch nonstick ovenproof frying pan or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the butter and oil. When the butter has melted and is foaming, pour the egg mixture into the pan, stirring well. Continue to cook and stir until the eggs become slightly scrambled, about 2 minutes. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake until the eggs are firm but still moist, about 6 minutes. Remove from the oven and flip the egg tart onto a serving plate. Slice and serve immediately.</p>
