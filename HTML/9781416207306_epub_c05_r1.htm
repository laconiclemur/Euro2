<p class="nonindent0">Pork puts on many guises through tapas, appearing as saucy meat balls and crackled belly pork, as tender loin and powerful chorizo, and most excitingly as morcilla sausage, served fried, with crisped edges and a smooth iron-rich center.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Baking slices of chorizo in red wine tenderizes the chorizo and also gives them a lovely winey kick. The heady rich sauce is just gorgeous sopped up with a chunk of crusty bread.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1/2 lb. semidry chorizo sausage, cut into 3/4–inch-thick slices</p>

<p class="nonindent">Morcilla (Spanish blood sausage) is one of the best blood sausages on the market. The best variety is the rice-filled one. Pairing it with spicy peppers and quail eggs is a very classic combination.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1/2 cup good olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">6 whole piquillo peppers (from a jar)</p>
<p class="hanging">1 clove garlic, crushed</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">14 oz. morcilla sausage, sliced into 4 rounds</p>
<p class="hanging02">4 fresh quail eggs</p>
<p class="nonindent">Over high heat, heat half the olive oil in a skillet, then add the peppers and garlic. Fry the peppers for 5–6 minutes until their skins begin to blister, stirring constantly to coat them all over in the oil and cook through. Remove from the heat, place on a serving plate, and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="extract">Add the rest of the oil to the pan and fry the sausage for 1 minute on each side. Add the eggs and fry for 1 minute, spooning hot oil over the yolks so they are cooked but still runny.</p>
<p class="extract">Serve the morcilla over the peppers with a quail egg on top.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Every tapas restaurant tends to have a variation on this terrific meatballs dish. This recipe makes a small portion for tapas, but if you double the recipe and make smaller meatballs, you’ll make a super sauce for pasta.</p>
<p class="hanging03">for the meatballs</p>
<p class="hanging">9 oz. lean ground pork</p>
<p class="hanging">1 small onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">2 cloves garlic, crushed and finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 red chile, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">2 sprigs fresh rosemary, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">2 sprigs fresh thyme, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">1 1/2 cups fresh white bread crumbs</p>
<p class="hanging">1 egg</p>
<p class="hanging">3 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging03">for the tomato sauce</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">1 small onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">2 cloves garlic, chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">7 tbsp. red wine</p>
<p class="hanging">1 1/3 lbs. cherry tomatoes, chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">1 bay leaf, crushed</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 tsp. sea salt</p>
<p class="hanging02">1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="nonindent">To make the meatballs, mix all the ingredients, except the oil, together in a large bowl, using your hands to combine evenly. Roll the mixture into 4 balls, about 1 1/2 inches in diameter, taking extra care to pack them tightly so they won’t break apart during cooking. Set on a plate and place in the refrigerator to chill for 1/2 hour.</p>
<p class="extract">To make the sauce, heat half the oil in a heavy-bottomed, lidded saucepan, add the onion and garlic, and cook gently until transparent. Add the red wine and let simmer until reduced by half. Add the tomatoes, bay leaf, salt, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil and stir vigorously, breaking down the cherry tomatoes with the back of the spoon. Replace the lid and reduce the heat to a moderate simmer.</p>
<p class="nonindent"><a id="page131"/>Once the meatballs have chilled, heat the remaining oil in a skillet. Brown the meatballs on all sides, then carefully add them to the tomato sauce. Turn the heat to a gentle boil and cook, uncovered, for 20 minutes, gently stirring halfway through. Serve immediately.</p>

<p class="nonindent">The combination of pork, morcilla, and apples is a pork lover’s dream and a well-loved tapas dish, too. Iberico pork comes from the Spanish breed of black Iberian pig, whose unusual flavor is a result of the acorns in its diet. Good-quality pork loin will act as a more than adequate substitute, if pork fillet is unavailable.</p>
<p class="hanging01">3/4 lb. pork fillet (use Iberico if you can find it)</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">4 tbsp. olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">3 fresh sage leaves</p>
<p class="hanging">2 small Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, and quartered</p>
<p class="hanging">7 oz. morcilla (Spanish blood sausage), cut into 4 rounds</p>
<p class="hanging02">1/2 cup medium-dry white wine</p>
<p class="nonindent">Preheat the oven to 400°F. Pat dry and generously season the pork. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet and fry the sage leaves for 1 minute. Remove the sage from the pan and reserve. Cook the pork on all sides in the skillet until it has a deep golden color. Transfer the pork to a roasting pan and put in the oven for 10 minutes. Set the skillet aside while the pork is roasting.</p>
<p class="extract">Once the pork is cooked, remove from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes, covered with foil to keep the heat in. Carve the meat into slices and arrange on a serving plate. Meanwhile, return the skillet to medium heat and pan-fry the apples and morcilla, so that the apples caramelize and the sausage is cooked. Put them on the plate with the sliced pork and sage leaves. Deglaze the skillet with the wine, scraping up all the meaty particles into the sauce. Once the reduction is syrupy, pour it over the meats and apples, and serve immediately.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Slow-cooked pork ribs smothered in barbecue sauce and so well cooked they virtually fall off the bones. Need I say more?</p>
<p class="hanging01">1 tbsp. chipotle chile in adobo sauce</p>
<p class="hanging">1 head garlic, cloves peeled</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tsp. sweet smoked paprika</p>
<p class="hanging">3 tbsp. tomato ketchup</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tsp. ground cumin</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. fresh oregano</p>
<p class="hanging">2/3 cup cider vinegar</p>
<p class="hanging">2/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging02">1 lb. pork ribs, cut into individual ribs</p>
<p class="nonindent">In a food processor, puree all the ingredients except the ribs until you get a completely smooth marinade.</p>
<p class="extract">Place the ribs in an airtight storage container and pour in the marinade, making sure all the ribs get a good coating. Place in the refrigerator to marinate for at least 2 hours but preferably overnight.</p>
<p class="extract">Preheat the oven to 300°F. Place the ribs and all the sauce in a deep roasting pan and cover with foil. Cook for 2 hours, until the meat is tender. Remove the foil and roast for another 1/2 hour until the sauce starts to caramelize and become sticky. Serve immediately with extra napkins for those sticky fingers.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Slow-roasted pork belly with crisp crackling skin and meat that melts in your mouth has to be one of life’s little food gifts, but paired with fennel it is simply divine.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1 (2 1/4–lb.) piece pork belly, rind scored</p>
<p class="hanging">3 tsp. sea salt</p>
<p class="hanging">1 onion, cut into eighths</p>
<p class="hanging">1 leek, sliced into thick rounds</p>
<p class="hanging">4 cloves garlic, peeled</p>
<p class="hanging">1 sprig fresh sage</p>
<p class="hanging">1 sprig fresh thyme</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. fennel seeds, crushed</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">1 1/4 cups apple cider</p>
<p class="hanging">2 1/2 cups homemade chicken stock</p>
<p class="hanging">scant 1 cup water</p>
<p class="hanging">2 (14–oz.) cans cannellini beans, rinsed and drained</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. Dijon mustard</p>
<p class="hanging02">finely grated zest of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="nonindent">The night before, rub the pork belly all over with 2 teaspoons of the salt. Let sit in the refrigerator overnight. Preheat the oven to 450°F. Place the onion, leek, garlic, and herbs in the bottom of a roasting pan. Rub the pork with a cloth to remove most of the salt. Sprinkle with the remaining salt, crushed fennel seeds, and pepper. With your hands, really work the mixture into the skin and the meat. Place the pork on the bed of vegetables in the roasting pan, and bake for 30 minutes until the skin has crackled.</p>
<p class="extract">Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F. Pour the cider, stock, and water into the pan and bake for another 2 hours. Add more water as needed so the bottom doesn’t burn. For the last 30 minutes, add the cannellini beans to the pan and stir well to coat in all the juices. Remove the pan from the oven, let the meat rest for 15 minutes before carving. Just before serving, stir the mustard and lemon zest through the hot beans.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Cataplana is a traditional Portuguese pork stew with garlic, wine, and clams, which is cooked in a special type of dish. Don’t fear, though. I think it works perfectly well in a good Dutch oven or cast-iron pan with a lid.</p>
<p class="hanging01">5 cloves garlic, chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tbsp. sweet paprika</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 tsp. chili powder</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt</p>
<p class="hanging">2/3 cup olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">5 1/2 oz. pork fillet, cut into 1/2–inch cubes</p>
<p class="hanging">1 onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">scant 1 cup dry white wine</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 lb. quahog clams in the shell, scrubbed</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. chopped fresh parsley</p>
<p class="hanging02">squeeze of lemon juice</p>
<p class="nonindent">Place the garlic, paprika, chili powder, salt, and half the olive oil in a food processor, and process to a paste. Marinate the pork in this mixture for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, stirring occasionally so all the meat gets a good coating.</p>
<p class="extract">Heat 3 tablespoons of the remaining olive oil in a wide saucepan with a well-fitting lid. Add the pork and all its marinade and cook over high heat for 5 minutes, stirring from time to time. Transfer the meat and sauce to a bowl and set aside. Add the rest of the oil to the pan, and fry the onion over medium-high heat for 5 minutes. Add the wine and bring to a boil for 1 minute. Return the pork to the pan, along with all the juices, stir well, then add the clams and replace the lid. Cook for 3–5 minutes, until the clams open. Discard any clams that do not open, stir through the parsley and a squeeze of lemon juice, and serve immediately.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Preheat the oven to 375°F. In a large bowl, mix the balsamic vinegar, half the oil, the garlic, brown sugar, marjoram, salt, and pepper. Mix thoroughly, then add the onions and mix again, making sure the onions are evenly coated.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Pour the mixture into a roasting pan. At the same time, place the sausages in a separate pan and drizzle with the remaining olive oil. Bake both pans in the oven for 25 minutes, turning the onions over halfway through, and giving the sausage pan a good shake. If the balsamic marinade begins to burn, add 2–3 tablespoons of water to the pan.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Spoon the hot onions into individual dishes with one of each of the types of sausage and top with a spoonful of the balsamic marinade.</p>
