  <h3 class="h3a">Savoury buns with red onion</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">Although the Italian title suggests otherwise, these are not the thin bread we know as ‘focaccia’–quite a few savoury breads in Italy are called focaccia. Very simple to make, the dough includes softened red onion, and is shaped into round buns and decorated with more red onion and a black olive. Delicious to eat by themselves or sliced and filled with mortadella or prosciutto to enjoy for lunch or a snack.</p>

  <p class="ing">Makes 10 buns</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra to brush</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 large red onion, finely chopped, plus 2 red onions, finely sliced, to garnish 700g/1lb 9oz/5½ cups strong (bread) flour</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 x 7g sachet of dried yeast</p>

  <p class="ing1">10g/¼oz/2 tsp salt</p>

  <p class="ing1">350ml/12fl oz/1½ cups lukewarm water</p>

  <p class="ing2">10 black olives, to garnish</p>

  <p class="para">Heat the olive oil in a pan, add the chopped onion and sweat for a few minutes until the onion has softened.</p>

  <p class="para">In a large bowl, combine the flour, yeast, salt and the softened onion. Gradually add the water and mix well to form a dough. Knead on a lightly floured surface for about 10 minutes. Form into a ball, cover with clingfilm (plastic wrap) and leave to rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until it has doubled in size.</p>

  <p class="para">Knead again for 5 minutes, then divide into 10 equal balls and gently press each with the palm of your hand to flatten slightly. Cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rise for 20 minutes.</p>

  <p class="para">Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6.</p>

  <p class="para1">Decorate each bun with thin slices of red onion and a black olive, brush with olive oil and bake for 30 minutes, until golden brown. Leave to cool before serving.</p>
