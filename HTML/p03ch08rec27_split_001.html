<p class="summary"><span class="italic">I asked Xavier Mestres about dishes of French origin that had been transformed and Hispanicized. I was given béchamel as an example. In Spain, it is sometimes made with white wine or sherry, and sometimes tomato. Here it includes fried onions, grated lemon zest, and saffron. The crunchy topping makes a lovely contrast to the creamy béchamel.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">For the fish, you can use cod, haddock, or turbot.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 onion, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">5⅓ tablespoons (⅔ stick) butter</p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="qun">2½ cups whole milk, heated</p>
<p class="qun">Grated zest of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="qun">A good pinch of saffron threads</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">2 large egg yolks, lightly beaten</p>
<p class="qun">½ pound scallops, preferably with orange roe</p>
<p class="qun">½ pound medium to large shrimp, peeled</p>
<p class="qun">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">½ pound skinless firm white fish fillets (see headnote above)</p>
<p class="qun">1 slice of white bread, crusts removed</p>
<p class="qun1">2 tablespoons butter, melted</p>
<p class="recsum">Sauté the onion in the butter in a medium saucepan over low heat until it is soft but not colored. Add the flour and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon for a minute or so, then add the milk a little at a time, stirring vigorously and taking it off the heat at each addition, until you have a thick, creamy sauce. Add the lemon zest, saffron, and salt and pepper to taste and simmer over low heat for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Beat in the egg yolks and take off the heat.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Cook the scallops and shrimp in the olive oil in a skillet over high heat for 2 minutes, turning the shrimp over as they turn pink and the scallops as they are seared. Transfer to a baking dish. Cook the fish fillets briefly in the same pan, sprinkling them with salt and turning them once. They can be slightly undercooked. Transfer to the baking dish.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Pour the béchamel over the fish and shellfish and mix gently.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Place bread under the broiler to dry out; grind to crumbs in a blender. Sprinkle over the béchamel. Drizzle with the melted butter. Put the baking dish in a preheated 400°F oven for 15 minutes to heat through, then put under the broiler to brown the top.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATION</span></p>
<p class="recsum">Add 5 tablespoons sherry to the béchamel.</p>
