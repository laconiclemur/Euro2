 GARAM MASALA RICE &amp; PEAS WITH RUNNY FRIED EGGS</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_green" id="nad0003368">
<em>This recipe is the ethnic version of egg and chips. We almost always have a Tupperware full of this rice in the freezer. I usually cook it en masse, giving me the excuse to freeze batches, so we can later whip it out, warm it up and fry a quick egg to go with it. The rice is lightly fragrant with spices and has a gorgeous brown colour from the caramelized onions. This meal is a firm favourite in our household, and once you’ve tried this recipe I assure you that you will feel like a rice pro! I certainly did after learning this one.</em>

<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Soak the rice in cold water and set aside.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003380">
<span class="green">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Put the clarified butter into a large non-stick pan and place on a high heat. Once the butter has melted, add the onions and turn the heat down to medium. Let the onions cook – at this point don’t be tempted to stir them.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003381">
<span class="green">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 You will see that the onions will start browning at the edges of the pan to begin with, so now stir and bring these brown onions to the centre. Keep doing this until all the onions are brown. This can take about 15–20 minutes. The onions should be almost black, not burnt but a very dark brown. Take them off the heat and let the butter cool down for about 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003382">
<span class="green">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Now add 250ml of boiling water and put the pan back on the heat. The onions will slowly soften as the water evaporates.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003383">
<span class="green">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 You will know the onions are ready when you squeeze a piece between the back of your spoon and the inside of the pan and the onion disintegrates. At this point, add the salt, garam masala and frozen peas. Cook for 3–5 minutes.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003384">
<span class="green">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Drain the rice and stir into the onion mix.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003385">
<span class="green">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Now add the remaining 750ml of boiling water, stir, and leave to boil for 15 minutes. Once all the water has evaporated, lower the temperature as much as you can and put a lid on the pan. Leave to steam for 10 minutes with the lid on.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003386">
<span class="green">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 Meanwhile, fry the eggs. Put the oil into a pan on a medium heat. Crack in the eggs and cook on one side for 3 minutes, basting the tops with oil from the pan to cook the whites.</p>

 Serve the hot rice with the warm runny egg.</p>
