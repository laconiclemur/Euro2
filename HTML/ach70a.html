<p class="author1"><span class="txit">ziti con broccoli</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This recipe is a good example of how the Tucci and Tropiano cooking styles have come to be melded. The Tucci family prepared this dish with ziti and no garlic. The Tropiano family prepared it using spaghetti broken into 2<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>-inch lengths, so now my mother sometimes serves it with broken spaghetti. Either way, it’s very tasty.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 large head broccoli (about 1 pound)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 pound ziti</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 clove garlic (optional), chopped</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Extra virgin olive oil to drizzle on each portion</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Trim off 2 to 3 inches of the tough broccoli stems and discard. Cut the broccoli florets away from the remaining tender stems. Cut the florets into large bite-size pieces. Peel the tender stems as you would carrots, then cut into short sections and then into thin, bite-size lengths. Set all of the prepared broccoli aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the stems and then the broccoli florets. Cook until tender but firm, about 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a bowl and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Add the pasta to the same water and cook, following the package instructions, until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of the cooking water before draining the pasta.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Return the drained pasta to the pot and toss with the olive oil. Add the garlic (if using), broccoli, and <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup reserved cooking water. Toss, adding more olive oil and water if the mixture is too dry. Serve immediately, garnished with freshly ground black pepper and drizzled with extra virgin olive oil.</p>
