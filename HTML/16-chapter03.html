<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Any rhapsodies made about soup’s economy, warmth, and filling properties seem specifically aimed at <em>sopa de ajo castellana</em>. This soup takes its name from the central heartland of Spain, where it is a hugely popular dish. While some call it simply <em>sopa castellana</em>, others refer to it as <em>sopa de ajo</em>, literally “soup of garlic.” This is a basic, classic version, though I have found many variations while traveling the back roads of Castilla. I always delight in the subtle differences from one house or rural restaurant to the next, such as a few added toasted cumin seeds.</span></strong></p>

<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a saucepan, bring the chicken stock to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover the pan, and keep it at a low boil.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> In a large ovenproof terra-cotta cazuela or skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic, jamón, and chorizo, and cook until the garlic is golden and fragrant but not burned, about 2 minutes. Add the bread, sprinkle on the pimentón, stir to blend, and then quickly pour the boiling stock into the pan before the pimentón can burn and become bitter. Reduce the heat to low and gently boil for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> One by one, crack the eggs into the pan and gently transfer the pan to the oven, watching that the eggs don’t huddle together. Bake until the egg whites are set but the yolks still runny, 6 or 7 minutes. Serve from the cazuela.</p>
