			<p class="rec-intro">Every bakery in France displays trays of freshly baked croissants for that quick morning mouthful with a cup of coffee. If you’ve never made your own it’s well worth a try and once you get the knack of folding them correctly it’s not that hard. You can also freeze the croissants once rolled and then whip them out of the freezer an hour before cooking. Enjoy them warm from the oven. </p>

			<p class="body">Dissolve the yeast in the warm water and milk powder. Add this to the sifted flour, sugar, salt and the 40g of melted butter. Knead well by hand or machine for 4–5 minutes until the dough is smooth and everything is incorporated, but do not overwork. Cover and leave the dough to rise until doubled in size.</p>
			<p class="body">Roll the dough out to about A4 size. Place the 300g of room-temperature butter in the middle and fold over the edges of the dough to enclose the butter completely. Dust the dough with flour and gently roll it out to a rectangle measuring about 40 x 26cm. Take both ends, fold them to the centre and fold again to make a much smaller rectangle. Wrap in cling film and refrigerate for an hour, then repeat the process of rolling out and folding the dough.</p>
			<p class="body">Roll the dough out on a floured surface to a thickness of 1cm and cut it into 30 triangles, each with a base of 12cm. Roll each triangle towards the point, then bring the points together to form the croissant shape. Place the croissants on a baking tray and leave them to rise for about 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 180°C/Fan 160°C/Gas 4.</p>
			<p class="body">Brush the croissants with beaten egg and bake for 15 minutes until cooked. <span class="char-style-override6"></span></p>
