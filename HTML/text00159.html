 POPCORN MUSSELS WITH PAPRIKA CHIVE MAYO</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_pink" id="nad0001172">
<em>I was left traumatized after my dad decided to cook a prawn mussel curry. He used to come home from his restaurant and cook up a storm, and among his other culinary creations he had tried currying herring roe, caviar, squid – and, on this occasion, mussels. After that, every time anyone asked me if I liked mussels I was quick to respond, ‘I hate them.’ But then I discovered beautiful cookbooks, which taught me how to cook mussels properly and treat them with respect. What I have learnt is that not everything needs to be curried. Especially not mussels. These popcorn mussels are deliciously crisp, with a sweet soft centre. The reason why I call them popcorn mussels is because that is exactly how we eat them – like popcorn. Once I start, I just cannot stop!</em>

<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Check the mussels – if there are any that have broken shells or that won’t open, discard them. Put the rest of the mussels into a large pan with 200ml of water. Put the lid on top and cook for 1 minute on a high heat.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001189">
<span class="pink">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Lower the heat to medium and continue to cook for another 3 minutes, then drain and leave to cool for few minutes.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001190">
<span class="pink">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Take out the mussel meat and place on a tray lined with kitchen paper to drain off excess moisture. If any mussels have not opened, just throw them away.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001191">
<span class="pink">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Tip the 130g of flour, the garlic powder, onion powder and baking powder into a bowl. Add the remaining 150ml of water and mix to a smooth paste.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001192">
<span class="pink">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Dust the mussel meat with the 50g of flour. Get rid of any excess flour, then put the mussel meat into the bowl with the paste and mix, making sure all the mussels are covered.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001193">
<span class="pink">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Heat the oil to 150°C, if you have a thermometer, otherwise drop in a bit of the batter – when it starts to sizzle and rise to the top, the oil is ready.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001194">
<span class="pink">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Fry the mussels in batches for 3–4 minutes. Drain on kitchen paper and sprinkle with salt.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001195">
<span class="pink">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 To make the sauce, put the mayo, paprika, salt and chives into a bowl and mix together. Serve the sauce with the mussels.</p>
