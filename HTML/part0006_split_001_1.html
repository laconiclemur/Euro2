			<p class="rec-intro">The modern method of preparing this classic French dish is lighter and more suited to modern tastes than the traditional version. Confit potatoes (see <a href="part0007_split_011.html#Grilled-Potatoes-cooked-in-duck-fat">here</a>) make a welcome accompaniment.</p>

			<p class="body">Mix the brine ingredients together. Make sure all the hair has been removed from the calf’s head, then rub it, and the extra tongue, with brine. Cover and place in the fridge for 2 days. </p>
			<p class="body">Rinse the head and tongue well and rub them with lemon juice. Place them in a large pan with the onions, carrots, celery, bouquet garni and most of the rest of the lemon juice, cover with cold water and bring to the boil. Skim any scum off the surface, season, then reduce to a very low simmer and continue to cook until tender. Two hours should be about right. </p>
			<p class="body">Remove the head from the pan and drain, then lay it on a piece of cling film, skin-side down. Peel the tongues and put one of them along the centre of the head. Roll up the head in the cling film as tightly as possible and place it in the fridge overnight to set. </p>
			<p class="body">Put the sweetbreads in a pan of salted water with a squeeze of lemon, bring to the boil and cook for 15 minutes, then leave to cool. Drain the sweetbreads well and trim, then cut them into nuggets about the size of large walnuts. Dust with flour, then dip in the egg and finally roll in the breadcrumbs seasoned with salt and piment d’Espelette. Cut the remaining tongue into rectangles of about 1cm x 4cm and cut the calf’s head into 1cm slices. Heat a little oil in a pan and sear the slices until warm and slightly crisp. Do the same with the tongue and the breaded sweetbreads. </p>
			<p class="body">For the shallot purée, cut the shallots in half, season well and place them in a roasting pan with the duck fat. Put them in a preheated oven, at 220°C/Fan 200°C/Gas 7, and cook until golden and soft. Blend them in a food processor with the duck fat until smooth.</p>
			<p class="body">To make the sauce, boil the veal jus, season and add the shallot, capers and piquillo peppers. Keep warm. </p>
			<p class="body">To serve, spread a generous spoonful of shallot purée on each plate and add the slices of calf’s head, tongue and sweetbread. Add some sauce and sprinkle with herbs and chopped egg. </p>
