            <p>Having access to artisanal ingredients inspires great cooking. Such ingredients are
                brought to the table with passion, superior skill level, and respect for tradition.
                Many of these items are regulated and classified with Denomination of Origin status.
                This is an official designation for food products that are differentiated by such
                features as their geographical origin, the method of preparation, and the source of
                the raw materials used. </p>
            <p>Spain is a large country with diverse climates, tastes, and cultural influences.
                There has always been an energetic compulsion to reap the glorious bounty of the
                land, which is impressive. Spain is the largest producer of wine, olives, and olive
                oil in the world. It also produces more cheese than any other nation and consumes a
                huge amount of seafood, second only to Japan. So respect for the ingredients is not
                only built into the culture, but many of the laws of the DO are protected and
                enforced by the Spanish Government and EU laws. </p>
            <p>Here is a short list of some of the ingredients that are available in the United
                States and offer endless inspiration chefs and home cooks to live with more
                enjoyment! </p>

            <p>Rich grazing lands provide Spain with great numbers of cows, sheep and goats. An

            <p>For hundreds of years Spain has achieved a consistent level of high quality cheeses
                in a great variety of textures and depth of flavors. Cow, sheep and goat milks are
                well represented along with a number of mixed milk cheeses here are a few of the

                are sausages in different shapes and flavors. Some varieties are fresh, but most are

                chorizo with bread and olives or cheese. Morcilla is a special type of chorizo more
                like a blood pudding made from pork blood, pork meat, and pork fat. Jamón serrano is

            <p>Spain’s warm sunny climate gives birth to more extra virgin olive oil than any other
                country. It is known for its superior quality and is sold around the globe. It is
                obviously a key element to the cuisine and is found in almost every recipe—even in
                many desserts. The International Olive Council (IOC) is an intergovernmental
                organization based in Madrid, with 23 member states. The IOC promotes olive oil
                around the world by tracking production, defining quality standards, and monitoring
                authenticity. </p>
            <p>Olive oils, especially from the Andalucian region, are loaded with antioxidants and
                have many proven health benefits. These oils are used for all types of cooking. In
                Southern Spain, where the cooks are masterful at the art of fried fish, they fry in
                nothing but extra virgin olive oil. The oil will not burn and adds great flavor to
                the end product. </p>

                        called guindillas. These are crushed into dishes when a little hot spice is

            <p>Handmade smoked paprika is a versatile spice in Spanish cooking. It adds a unique
                robust and rustic flavor to soups, stews, grilled seafood, and rice dishes. Several
                varieties of small red peppers are smoke-dried in large drying houses for about two
                weeks. The chiles are exposed to large amounts of oak smoke to give it a distinctive
                concentrated smoky flavor. </p>

                throughout Spain. They are quite often found lightly fried in olive oil and

            <h3><a xmlns:saxon="http://icl.com/saxon" id="d0e422"/>Conservas </h3>
            <p>Spaniards have a passion and skill with expertly preserved fish in cans. These
                products capture and preserve the sweet meats of the sea. The cans are bursting with
                fresh saltwater ocean flavors when opened a year later. The wide variety includes
                sardines, mackerel, clams, mussels, razor clams, tuna, and anchovies. When you order
                these at a tapas bar, many times the bartender will pull the top back and serve it
                to you still in the can, with some bread or potato chips. </p>
            <h3><a xmlns:saxon="http://icl.com/saxon" id="d0e426"/>Saffron </h3>
            <p>Brought to Spain by the Moors along with oranges, almonds, and honey, saffron is the
                stamen of the crocus. It has been cultivated for over 4,000 years and has many uses
                in traditional and modern medicine. Cooks prize the flavor and aroma of saffron
                because of its unique and pungent perfume and sweet aroma of honey and fresh grass.
                The color it adds to foods like paella and saffron fish broth is vibrant and
                appetizing. It remains the most expensive spice because it must be harvested by hand
                and takes a great deal of space to grow. A football field of crocus is needed to
                produce one pound of saffron, which will be worth about $3,000 on the American
                market. </p>

            <h3><a xmlns:saxon="http://icl.com/saxon" id="d0e435"/>Fresh Fish </h3>
            <p>Spain consumes more seafood per person than any other country except Japan. The
                variety pulled from the waters surrounding the peninsula is put to good use. Famous
                dishes include bacaloa (salt cod), trout, calamari, tunas, octopus, langostinos,
                mussels, clams, oysters, and <span class="emphasis"><em>gambas al
                ajillo</em></span>. </p>
            <p>The daily catch is taken into the town markets and sells out in a few hours. “The
                ocean must love us to give us such a feast every day,” say the fishermen in the
                village of Sanlucar de Barrameda, Southern Spain. </p>
            <h3><a xmlns:saxon="http://icl.com/saxon" id="saltcod"/>Bacalao (Salt Cod) </h3>
            <p>Cod fish that has been salted, dried, and preserved is later de-salted and hydrated
                to make some of the most loved dishes in Spain. Bacalao is eaten in huge quantities
                in Spain. The process of drying and rehydrating gives the fish a unique flavor and
                texture. </p>

            <p>Any discussion of Spanish food is incomplete without talking about wine. All of the
                history, skill, and passion that go into the ingredients and cooking in Spain are
                equaled in wine production. From sophisticated and world-renowned wines to basic
                table wine and chatos served in little glasses at the tapas bars, the food and wine
                are inseparable. Spain’s landscape is almost covered with grapes. Almost 18 percent
                of the world’s vineyards are in Spain. This huge number means that a great portion
                of the country is dedicated to wine. Spain has 65 DO wine regions. </p>

            <p>The ancient art of sherry making continues in the unique micro climate of the sherry
                triangle in Southern Spain. The towns of Jerez de la Frontera, San Lucar de
                Barremeda, and Puerto de Santa Maria have perfect natural conditions for growing the
                Palomino grapes and aging the fortified wines in a complex solera system that gives
                sherry its characteristic blend of vintages. </p>
            <p>Sherry pairs perfectly with food. The sherries range in style from salty, dry finos
                to fragrant, nutty amontillados, rich and lavish olorosos, and syrupy sweet Pedro
                Ximenez. </p>
