<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6 TO 8</span></p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE PASTRY</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 large egg</p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon baking soda</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup dry white wine or hard cider</p>
<p class="qun">½ teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="qun">About 2¼ cups all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="qun">1 egg, separated</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE FILLING</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 large onion, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">1 red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and cut into small pieces</p>
<p class="qun">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">One 14-ounce can chopped tomatoes</p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon sugar</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">About 14 ounces canned tuna in oil, drained and flaked</p>
<p class="qun">20 to 24 olives, such as Kalamata, pitted and chopped</p>
<p class="qun1">2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped</p>
<p class="recsum">For the pastry, beat the egg lightly with a fork in a large bowl. Beat in the baking soda, oil, wine, and salt. Gradually work in enough flour to make a soft, malleable dough, stirring it in with a fork to begin with, then working it in with your hands. Roll the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and let it rest at room temperature for an hour.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Meanwhile, for the filling, fry the onion and bell pepper in the oil in a large skillet, stirring often, until soft. Add the tomatoes, sugar, and a little salt and cook over medium heat for about 15 minutes, until the sauce is jammy. Stir in the tuna, olives, and chopped eggs.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Grease a pie pan about 11 inches in diameter with oil. Divide the dough into 2 pieces, one slightly less than twice as big as the other. Roll out the larger piece (keep the remaining dough in plastic wrap) on a smooth work surface—do not flour the surface or the rolling pin; the dough will not stick, because it is oil-based. Roll it out so that it is large enough to come over the edges of the pan, and carefully transfer the dough to the pan by rolling it up onto the rolling pin, then unrolling it gently into the pan. Without stretching the dough, ease it into the corners. Trim the edges to a ½-inch border. Lightly beat the egg white, and brush it all over the dough. Bake in a preheated 350°F oven for 10 minutes, then let cool. (Leave the oven on.)</p>
<p class="recsum1">Spread the filling evenly in the pie shell. Roll out the remaining dough to a large circle and lay it carefully on top of the filling so that it covers the edges of the bottom crust. Brush with the egg yolk mixed with 1 teaspoon water. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until the crust is lightly browned. It is good hot or cold.</p>
