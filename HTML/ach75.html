<p class="author1"><span class="txit">farfalle con carciofi, patate, e prosciutto</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">Potatoes are a traditional ingredient in northern Italian cooking, just as the tomato is crucial to unique flavors of southern Italian cooking. In this recipe inspired by Gianni’s mother, who would prepare it in the late fall at the beginning of the artichoke season, the potatoes create a creamy sauce that does not compete with the subtle flavor of the artichokes.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 large artichokes, or one 9-ounce package frozen artichoke hearts, thawed, or one 15-ounce can artichoke bottoms, drained</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice (for fresh artichokes)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup extra virgin olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup thinly sliced onions (about 1 mediumsize onion)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup julienned prosciutto, pancetta, or bacon (about 3 ounces)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 medium-size potatoes, peeled, halved, and sliced <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> inch thick and quartered (about 2 cups)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cups chicken broth or water</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 pound farfalle</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> If using fresh artichokes, peel off and discard the hard outer leaves. Cut off the top of each artichoke at the point where the leaves become almost white. Discard the top. Cut the remaining artichoke into <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">8</sub>-inch-thick wedges. Remove any fine hairs (choke) from each wedge. Place the trimmed artichoke pieces in a bowl of cold water along with the lemon juice. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Warm the olive oil in a large skillet or large saucepan set over medium heat. Add the onions, cover, and cook until soft but not browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in the prosciutto <a id="page_145"/>and cook to soften, about 1 minute. Stir in the parsley and potatoes. Drain the fresh artichokes, pat dry, and stir them into the pan. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and cook to allow the flavors to combine, about 2 minutes. Add the broth and simmer slowly, with the lid on, until the potatoes and artichokes are tender, 5 to 10 minutes. (If you are using frozen or canned artichokes, add them now, allowing them to warm through while the sauce reduces.)</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook, following the package instructions, until al dente. Drain, and stir the pasta into the vegetable mixture. Gently stir the pasta and sauce over low heat to coat and thicken slightly. Add the Parmesan cheese and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Distribute among plates or pasta bowls, drizzle with the extra virgin olive oil, and serve.</p>
<p class="serves"><span class="smallcaps">— SERVES 4 AS A SECOND COURSE — 6 AS A FIRST COURSE</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">WINE PAIRING</span>:</span> Light white or light red</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATIONS</span>:</span> Other pastas that hold sauce well, such as rigatoni, fresh fettuccine, or fusilli, may be substituted for farfalle. And adjustments to the ingredients can be made according to taste and preference. For example:</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="red">•</span> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint, thyme, or marjoram leaves may be sprinkled on top of the pasta along with the Parmesan cheese.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="red">•</span> The prosciutto may be eliminated to make a flavorful vegetarian pasta.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="red">•</span> Broccoli or cauliflower may be added to the sauce: Add 1 head trimmed cauliflower florets to the salted boiling water along with the pasta and cook until the pasta is al dente. Trimmed broccoli florets will require less cooking time than cauliflower and may be added to the pasta during the last 5 minutes of cooking.</p>
