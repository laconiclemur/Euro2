<p class="noindentb">The year my family lived in Florence, my mother shopped at a local <span class="txit">tavola calda</span> (specialty food store), which carried a number of prepared salads. This was one of my favorites. My mother asked the owner for his recipe so she could make it at home herself. It has long been one of our standard lunch dishes.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup long-grain white or brown rice</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups cold water</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice (from about 1 lemon)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup frozen peas</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Place the rice and water in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the rice is tender and most, if not all, of the water has been absorbed, about 20 minutes. If water remains, drain the rice before placing it in the serving bowl.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> In a small bowl, whisk the lemon juice and vinegar, and season with salt and pepper. Gradually whisk in the olive oil. Pour a small portion of this dressing onto the rice and toss. Set the rice aside to cool.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Place the peas in a colander. Pour 3 to 4 cups of hot water over them to defrost and cook slightly. Drain, then stir the peas and parsley into the cooled rice. Whisk the remaining dressing before pouring it over the rice and tossing to coat evenly. Serve at room temperature.</p>
