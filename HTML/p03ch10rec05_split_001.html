<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">These slow-cooked lamb shanks have a marvelous melt-in-the-mouth quality, and the wine sauce is enriched by the gelatin they release. They go well with these crunchy roasted potatoes, but you could also serve them with mashed potatoes (page 281).</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4</span></p>
<p class="qun">3 tablespoons mild olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">4 small lamb shanks (about 1 pound each)</p>
<p class="qun">1 large onion, finely chopped</p>
<p class="qun">2 carrots, sliced</p>
<p class="qun">5 garlic cloves, finely chopped</p>
<p class="qun">4 tomatoes, peeled and finely chopped</p>
<p class="qun">2 cups dry white wine</p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup brandy (optional)</p>
<p class="qun">2 cups water</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon sugar</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE POTATOES</span></p>
<p class="qun">1½ pounds new potatoes, peeled</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun1">Olive oil</p>
<p class="recsum">Heat the oil in a wide casserole and brown the shanks over medium heat, turning them occasionally. Take them out.</p>
<p class="summary">Cook the onion and carrots in the same oil over medium heat until the onion is soft, stirring often. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until the aroma rises, then add the tomatoes and cook for 8 minutes.</p>
<p class="summary">Add the shanks and pour in the wine, brandy if using, and water. Season with salt and pepper and the sugar and cook, covered, over low heat at a bare simmer for 2 hours, or until the meat is so tender you can pull it off the bone; turn the shanks 3 or 4 times and add a little water if necessary to keep them half covered, then let the sauce reduce toward the end. I like to leave the sauce as it is, but if you wish, lift out the shanks and blend the sauce to a cream with an immersion blender (as they now do in Spain), then return the shanks to the pot.</p>
<p class="summary">Meanwhile, for the potatoes, cook them in boiling salted water until barely tender. Drain and cut them in half, or into quarters, if large.</p>
<p class="summary">Place the potatoes in a roasting pan or baking dish, sprinkle with salt, and pour a good amount of olive oil over them, so that when you turn them, they become well coated all over. Roast in a preheated 425°F oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until crisp and golden.</p>
