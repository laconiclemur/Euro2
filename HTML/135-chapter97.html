<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">From the Atlantic fishing communities of the north—Galicia, Cantabria, Asturias, and the Basque Country—comes this classic dish prepared with either clams or hake, or a combination of the two. The green in the sauce is from a generous amount of fresh parsley. Use flat-leaf Italian parsley, not the curly variety. (Parsley is so common in the Spanish kitchen that it is given free in fishmongers’ and butchers’ shops.)</span></strong></p>

<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Purge the clams of any sand by soaking in salty water following the directions on <a href="250-chapter186.html#page_341">page 341</a>. Discard any clams with broken shells.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a large pot, add the clams, bay leaf, and ½&gt; cup/120 ml water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat, cover the pot, and simmer, shaking the pot from time to time, until the clams have opened, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat. Drain, reserving the liquid. Discard any clams that did not open.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> In a cazuela, heavy casserole, large sauté pan, or deep skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat and cook the onion until soft and nearly translucent, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute, stirring frequently. Combine the reserved liquid from the clams with water to make ¾ cup/180 ml and add to the pan along with the wine and parsley. Season with salt and whisk in the flour. Bring to a boil and cook uncovered, stirring from time to time, over a low boil for 5 minutes to thicken the sauce.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Add the clams to the pan and cook uncovered, shaking the pan from time to time, for 5 minutes. Transfer to a shallow serving bowl, pour over the sauce from the pan, and serve immediately.</p>
