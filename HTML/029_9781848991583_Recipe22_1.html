<p class="normal"><b>The dish carpaccio was first created in 1950 by Giuseppe Cipriani for the Comtesse Amalia Mocenigo, who had been advised by her doctor she should eat her meat raw. At the same time, works by the famous fifteenth-century painter, Vittore Carpaccio, were being exhibited. His paintings almost always contained large areas of red in varying tones, and this reminded Cipriani of meat, and so he gave his dish the name carpaccio. Although other meats and fish, particularly tuna, can be used for carpaccio, this dish is made with succulent beef tenderloin. I have given it a modern twist by serving it with a piquant wasabi cream accompanied by beef tartare seasoned with capers and shallot, and some tiny, delicate croutons, fresh chives and arugula.</b></p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">SERVES</span></b> 4</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 25 minutes, plus 2 to 3 hours freezing and making the croutons</p>
<p class="acktxt">12 ounces beef tenderloin, trimmed</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons whipping cream</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 teaspoon wasabi paste</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 tablespoons finely snipped chives</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 tablespoons very finely diced Croutons (see <a href="013_9781848991583_Recipe7.html">page 18</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="acktxta">1 handful arugula leaves, to serve</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE TARTARE</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">2 teaspoons finely chopped shallot</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 teaspoon chopped parsley leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 teaspoon tomato ketchup</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 teaspoon chopped capers</p>
<p class="acktxt">1½ teaspoons olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">5 ounces beef tenderloin, trimmed and very finely chopped</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> To make the carpaccio, lay two pieces of plastic wrap, 12 x 8 inches each, on top of each other to form one sheet of plastic wrap. Put the beef tenderloin in the middle and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the oil, then wrap the beef in the plastic wrap to form a tight cylinder. Put it in the freezer 2 to 3 hours until it is firm but still slightly soft when pressed.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Meanwhile, prepare the tartare. Mix the shallot, parsley, tomato ketchup and capers in a bowl, then drizzle in the remaining oil, stirring continuously. Finally, stir in the chopped beef and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and chill until ready to serve.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Just before serving, gently whisk together the cream and wasabi paste in a bowl until soft peaks form. Cover with plastic wrap and leave at room temperature.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Take the beef out of the freezer and remove the plastic wrap. Using a very sharp knife, cut it into very thin slices and arrange on serving plates, spreading the slices out. Work quickly, because the beef will soon thaw and it is much easier to work with them when still slightly frozen.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> Season with salt and pepper to taste, sprinkle with the chives, croutons and a drizzle of oil, and serve with the tartare, wasabi cream and fresh arugula leaves.</p>
