<p class="summary">According to legend, the Spaniards first encountered chocolate as a drink in Mexico in 1519, when the conquistador Hernando Cortés met the Aztec ruler Montezuma, and it was Cortés who introduced the drink to the Spanish court. Chocolate was known only as a drink in Spain until the nineteenth century, and it was always something that only the rich could afford. It was also associated with the Church, because monks in the Americas sent beans to their monasteries back home. The clergy encouraged its use during Lent, believing the drink to have restorative and medicinal properties; in the mid-seventeenth century, Pope Alexander VII declared that liquids, including chocolate, did not break the fast.</p>
<p class="summary">The first Spanish cocoa factory was in Astorga in León, and there is now a chocolate museum there. The Maragato muleteers (see page 94) transported the powder all over Spain. A Basque trading company, the Real Compañía Guipuzcoana de Caracas, held the monopoly on the Venezuelan cocoa trade in the eighteenth century. Cocoa beans arrived in the Basque ports and were then shipped to cities all over Europe. One of these was the French Basque city of Bayonne, where Spanish and Portuguese Converso families started a chocolate industry, the first in France. That is where the Basque and Catalan bourgeoisies first got the solid block chocolate they used to make cakes and other desserts.</p>
<p class="summary">Chocolate cakes and desserts are part of the bourgeois cuisines of Spain that developed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in the industrialized north. This was the period when Spain gradually lost its colonies, and many Spaniards who had become rich in the colonies came back to settle in large numbers in Asturias, the Basque Country, and Catalonia, and in ports like Cádiz and Santander. They built fabulous houses, painted pink, orange, mauve, blue, and green, that were inspired by the colonial houses in Mexico, and they invested in the emerging industries. The newly rich local bourgeoisies and these <span class="italic">indianos</span> employed cooks and demanded from them a refined, mostly French style of cooking and baking.</p>
