<p class="normal"><b>I love cod, and I am always improvising new ways to cook it. My wife, Claire, always sneaks into the kitchen when I cook cod at home—it’s the wonderful smells wafting through the house that attracts her. Cooking it en papillote is one of my favourite methods; it’s fun, fresh, fast and delicious. Here, I give the recipe a modern twist with Asian ingredients. Even if you like strong spices, stick to a mild curry powder, or the cod will be overpowered and the balance of the dish will be lost. Ginger, red onion and Chardonnay vinegar set the right tone for the mango—flavorsome, but not too sweet. Then all that’s left to do is to make a light, creamy sauce with coconut milk and herbs.</b></p>

<p class="acktxta"><span class="smallcaps"><b>COOKING TIME</b></span> 30 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 cod loins, about 5 ounces each, skin on</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 teaspoon light soft brown sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons Chardonnay vinegar</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 small red onion, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 firm mango, peeled, seeded and roughly chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">1-inch piece gingerroot, peeled and grated</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 small red chili, halved, seeded and cut into julienne strips</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 teaspoon mild curry powder</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">¼ cup Fish Stock (see <a href="009_9781848991583_Recipe3.html#pageid_17">page 17</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">¼ cup coconut milk</p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons whipping cream, lightly whipped</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon chopped chervil leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 teaspoon lemon juice</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Heat the oven to 400°F and cut out four 18- x 10-inch rectangles of parchment paper. The fish should have been pin boned but, if not, remove all small bones with a pair of fish tweezers.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Heat a small skillet until medium-hot. Add the sugar and Chardonnay vinegar and cook 1 to 2 minutes until the sugar dissolves. Add the onion and sauté 3 to 4 minutes, then reduce the heat to low, add the mango and ginger and cook about 8 minutes until the mango is soft, but still holding its shape. Add the chili and stir gently to combine, then remove from the heat and leave to cool.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Season the cod on both sides with curry powder, salt and pepper. Melt the butter with the oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. When the butter is foaming, add the cod, skin-side down, and sauté 3 to 4 minutes until the skin is golden brown and crisp.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Put the parchment paper rectangles on the countertop, then spoon the mango equally onto half of each sheet. Put the cod on top, skin-side up. Fold the paper over the filling and then fold along the edges to seal the liquid in securely. Put the packages in a baking sheet and bake 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and leave to rest 2 minutes.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> While the fish cooks, make the sauce. Heat a sauté pan over medium heat. Add the stock and coconut milk and bring to a boil, then turn the heat down to low and simmer 4 to 5 minutes until they reduce by half.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>6</b> Carefully open one side of each package and pour the juices into the sauce, then put the packages on serving plates. Whisk the cream into the sauce and return it to a boil, then remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper. Add the chervil and finish with the lemon juice. Serve the packages <i>en papillote</i> at the table with the sauce served separately, or open the packages, slide out the filling and spoon the sauce on top.</p>
