  <p class="center-para"><a id="page_71" class="calibre1"></a>Stews are popular all over the world; they are warming, welcoming, and a wonderful way to use economical cuts of meat. Pieces of meat that are slowly cooked in a sauce with herbs, spices and seasonings are often far more tender and tasty than a quickly grilled steak, and with the inclusion of vegetables can be a meal in themselves – or serve with polenta (cornmeal), rice, mashed potatoes or lots of good bread to mop up the juices.</p>

  <p class="center-para">The classic Italian way of preparing a stew begins with a <em class="calibre4">soffritto</em>, a gently fried mix of onion, celery and carrot – this important step forms the base of the stew, ensuring maximum flavour. The sealing or browning of the pieces of meat is equally important, giving a rich flavour and adding colour to the stew. It is important to cook the stew on a very gentle heat because boiling will toughen the meat. To enhance the flavour, stews are best made the day before and gently reheated when required.</p>

  <p class="center-para">You can usually find ready-cut chunks of meat clearly marked ‘for stewing’ in supermarkets, or your butcher will cut the meat for you. If you are beginning with a larger piece of meat, it should be cut into cubes of roughly 4–5cm/1½– 2 inches; pieces that are too small will fall apart and may dry out during cooking.</p>

  <p class="center-para">The following are ideal cuts for stewing: Lamb: scrag end and middle neck, shoulder, knuckle/shank Beef: neck, chuck, blade, brisket, thick flank, thin flank, skirt, shin/shank, topside, silverside, knuckle Pork: shoulder – although you can use any cut, shoulder is the most economical</p>

  <p class="center-para">Italian stews are as varied as the country: from a rich Tyrolean goulash originating in the Austrian-influenced Alpine region of Trentino-Alto Adige, to my slow-cooked vegetable stew using the typical sun-drenched ingredients of the southern regions – you will find a dish to satisfy every taste and mood.</p>
