<h1 class="chapter">pork tenderloin with flavio’s tuscan ‘dust’</h1>
<div class="covser1"><a id="page_207"/><img alt="images" src="images/p207.jpg"/></div>
<p class="tx2"><b>This is our speedy version of an <i>arista</i>, an ancient dish made from loin of pork roast with rosemary and garlic. <i>Arista</i> comes from the Greek word <i>aristo</i>, meaning ‘best’. Our son Flavio makes a Tuscan rub or ‘dust’ that can be used on potatoes, chicken or meat dishes such as this. The quantities given here make more rub than you need for this dish, but it will keep in the cupboard for as long as other dried herbs (seek how to dry herbs on <a href="9781784881757_Split27.html#page_43a">herbs</a>). The rub can also be made with fennel seeds, which Giancarlo loves but Flavio doesn’t – the choice is yours! Serve the tenderloin with the lentils in <a href="9781784881757_Split131.html#page_229">lentils with soffritto</a>.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 4–6 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>1 × 600 g (1 lb 5 oz) pork tenderloin</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>½ teaspoon fine sea salt</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 tablespoon chicken fat or extra-virgin olive oil</b></p>
<p class="tx3"><b>FOR THE DUST</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 teaspoons dried or fresh rosemary needles</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 teaspoon dried sage or 3 large fresh sage leaves</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 teaspoon fennel seeds, crushed (optional)</b></p>
<p class="tx3"><b>TO SERVE</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b><a href="9781784881757_Split131.html#page_229">Lentils with Soffritto</a>, to serve</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Start by making the dust. If you are using dried herbs, crush them with the seeds (if using) with a pestle and mortar or a spice grinder. If using fresh herbs, finely chop them together with the seeds (if using) on a board with a sharp knife.</p>
<p class="tx">Evenly sprinkle 1 tablespoon of dust on the tenderloin over a piece of baking parchment with the salt and pepper. Trim away any tough silver skin from the tenderloin and roll it in the dust on the paper. Roll up the loin in the parchment, place it on a plate and set aside in the fridge for at least 30 minutes (or up to 8 hours).</p>
<p class="tx">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F/Gas 4). Remove the pork from the fridge and allow it to come to room temperature. Heat the chicken fat or oil in a large non-stick frying pan and, when hot, add the pork and brown it all over to seal in the juices. Transfer to a roasting tin and cook in the oven for 12–15 minutes or until it is firm to the touch. Remove from the oven and set aside, covered in foil and a tea towel (dish towel) to rest for 10 minutes. Cut into roughly 1 cm- (½ in-) thick slices and arrange on top of warm lentils, with any cooking juices poured over the meat.</p>
