    INTRODUCTION</h1>

    <p class="nonindent"><span class="dropcaps">T</span><span class="small1">HERE IS NO MORE APPROPRIATE TIME THAN NOW TO THINK ABOUT HOW AND WHY WE</span> cook. Why does cooking give us so much satisfaction? Yes, it nourishes us, we enjoy savoring it and feel physically good when we have eaten and are satiated. But the cooking and sharing of food has much more to say to us than “You are full and feel good.” Food is a way of connecting with the people who surround us. Through food we communicate love, compassion, and understanding. The sharing of dishes together at the table opens doors for us to penetrate the thoughts of those around us. There is no better opportunity to communicate with our children than at the table, to discuss values of life that are important to us as individuals, as a family, and as a part of the world we live in. Our approach to food, our respect for and understanding of the ingredients we work with, will dictate our future survival. Will there be enough available for the generations to come? Will the world survive?</p>

    <p class="indent">As overconsumption and greed have come to haunt us, it is now a time for reflection, for looking back at the generations before us, to understand their approach to the table. In my research into the twelve regions of Italy that I explore here, some answers came to light. The recipes I share with you reflect a respect for food—growing it, shepherding the animals, foraging for the gifts of nature in the wild, and hunting respectfully to put nourishing meat on the table, not just for sport. Nothing is wasted. Bread is recycled and used in soups, casseroles, lasagnas, and desserts. Water is carefully conserved; for instance, the same water in which vegetables are cooked is used to cook the pasta that follows, and then that is saved for soups or for making risotto. The fat that is rendered is used as a base for a soup or a pasta or a braised dish. The outer leaves of cauliflower and broccoli and the stalks of Swiss chard are all included in a meal. When an animal is sacrificed for our food, all of the animal parts are used, not just the breast of the chicken wrapped tightly in plastic wrap. The legs, neck, and wings make a great soup. The liver, heart, and gizzards make a great frittata or pasta sauce. And there is nothing better than a whole chicken, perfectly roasted, or a chicken cut in pieces and turned into a chicken cacciatore with drumsticks, wings, neck, and thighs all there to nibble on.</p>

    <p class="indent"><a class="calibre8" id="pagexv"></a>This kind of respect for the foods we prepare also leads to a much more sensible and balanced intake of proteins, legumes, vegetables, and so on. In most of the recipes in this book, it is evident that the dish is rooted in the reality of the times, when frugality went along with hard work, and home cooks made do with what was on hand. And, of course, they wanted dishes that would taste good. So you’ll find these recipes tasty, satisfying, relatively easy to prepare. But, most of all, they are a testimony to the harmony of elements that result in a harmony of taste.</p>

    <p class="indent">“Waste not, want not,” and make it delicious.</p>
