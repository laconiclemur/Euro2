<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0001243">This is quite a filling dish – it’s a classic Mum’s recipe, like <em class="calibre9">pencas</em> (see <a href="part0042.html#pg70" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>). I ate it recently for the first time in many years when I visited a small village near Cádiz that we had to drive for hours through the surrounding mountains to get to. This is my version.</p>

<div class="maincontent_wrapper">
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0001260">Preheat the oven to 160–170°C.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0001261">Cut the aubergines in half, then make criss-cross cuts about 1cm deep into the flesh – this will help it to cook through. Season with salt and pepper, rub with olive oil, then place on a baking tray, cover with foil and roast for 30–35 minutes. You want the aubergines to be very soft, but it’s important not to burn their skin or they will be tough.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0001262">While the aubergines are roasting, put a little oil into a large pan on a medium heat, and cook the minced beef until all the water has evaporated. Once the mince has started to brown a bit, remove it from the pan.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0001263">Add the rest of the oil to the pan, then put in the garlic and onions and a little salt. Cook until caramelized, then add the chilli, carrots, leek and celery. Reduce the heat slightly, to medium-low, and cook until the vegetables are soft. Season with salt and pepper, then add the wine. Cook until the wine has evaporated, then add the paprika and tomatoes. Return the meat to the pan and cook everything slowly on a low heat until thick. Stir in the chives.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0001264">Heat your grill to hot.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0001265">When the aubergines are ready, spoon the meat and sauce mixture on to the aubergine halves. Grate the cheese over the top and put under the grill until melted and crispy. Cut into slices to serve.</p>
