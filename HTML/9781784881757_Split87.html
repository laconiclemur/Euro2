<h1 class="chapter">pea &amp; tarragon soup</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>This incredibly easy soup is something I rustle up quickly when I need a quick lunch or starter. I love the aniseed flavours of tarragon. It is known in Italy as <i>dragoncello</i> – a wonderful name which conjures up images of medieval knights and mythical beasts. It may be so named as it is said to have been introduced to Siena by Charlemagne in 774, when it was used to make <a href="9781784881757_Split75.html#page_123">salsa verde</a>.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 4 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra to serve</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 white onion, peeled and finely chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt and freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>500 g (1 lb 2 oz) frozen or fresh peas</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>small bunch of tarragon</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 litre (34 fl oz/4¼ cups) <a href="9781784881757_Split15.html#page_32">Chicken Stock</a></b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>4 slices of pancetta, cut into 1 cm- (½ in-) wide strips (optional)</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Heat half the oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat, then add the onions, a pinch of salt and pepper, and sauté until soft. Add the peas and 2 sprigs of the tarragon, and stir through. Pour in the stock and bring to the boil. Cook the peas for 5 minutes if frozen and 10 minutes if fresh.</p>
<p class="tx">Meanwhile, fry the pancetta (if using) in the remaining olive oil in a nonstick frying pan, until just crispy, then remove from the pan and set aside. When the peas are soft use a stick blender or food processor to blitz the soup until smooth. Serve scattered with the remaining tarragon, leaves stripped and roughly chopped, the pancetta, if using, and a swirl of good-quality olive oil.</p>
