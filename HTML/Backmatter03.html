<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">N</span><small>O CHEF ACHIEVES</small> success on his or her own. I consider myself lucky to have been able to accomplish so many of my goals with the help of the collective and cumulative effort of my co-workers, family and friends, colleagues and mentors.</p>
<p class="indent">I have had the privilege of working with some pretty amazing people on this cookbook, all of whom have contributed their talents to help bring the book to life, and I couldn’t be more grateful.</p>
<p class="indent">To my beautiful, talented wife, Stacy Isabella—thank you for your patience, love, and support. I am so appreciative for all the work you did, not just in helping me develop the recipes, but also in putting up with my crazy schedule as I continue to open new restaurants and build my business. I love you.</p>
<p class="indent">So much love and gratitude to my mom, Joanne, my sister, Diana, and brother, Ben, for being who they are, keeping me grounded, and supporting me every step of the way. I wouldn’t be where I am today without you. Thank you.</p>
<p class="indent">Thank you to my agent Howard Yoon, as well as Katie McHugh, Renee Sedliar, Christine Marra, and the entire Da Capo team for making my dream of one day writing a cookbook come true.</p>
<p class="indent">A big thank you to two friends and collaborators: writer Carol Blymire, who “got” me from day one and whose writing so perfectly tells the stories I want to tell; and Greg Powers, a true artist, who brings my food to life through his photography.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_323"/>A special thanks to Jen Resick Williams of KnowPR for being an extra set of arms, legs, eyes, and ears and an integral part of the work I do.</p>
<p class="indent">To my team at Graffiato: thank you for all your hard work, long hours, dedication, and focus on building the restaurant I’ve always dreamed of. You’re all like one big crazy family to me, and I’m grateful to you all.</p>
<p class="indent">Thank you to the investors who believed in me, as well as my former bosses and chef mentors from whom I’ve learned so much over the years.</p>
<p class="indent">Thank you to our cookbook recipe testers: Ryan Adams, Marisa Brown, Bill and Cheryl Bunce, Catherine Gelera, Jen Grimes, Nick Hall, Aaron Keefer, Jessica Lahey, Marshall and Amy Senk, Linda Tipton, Jim Webster, and Chris Wilson.</p>
<p class="indent">And last, but most certainly not least: my Grandma Antoinette was and continues to be my inspiration in the kitchen, and in life. I miss you more than you could know. I hope this book would’ve made you proud.</p>
