  <h2 class="section sgc-1" id="c11-s40"><a id="page202"></a>THE FOIE GRAS</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">The production of <em>foie gras</em> is less mysterious than generally believed. It depends, essentially, on two phases of feeding and development in the goose or duck. (In France, the best goose <em>foie gras</em> is produced from a Périgord race of geese and the best duck <em>foie gras</em>, firmer, smaller and less “melting” than the goose’s, from a sterile hybrid of the Barbary duck and a native breed.) The first phase, involving a varied diet and normal exercise, is designed to strengthen the bird and in particular to develop a resistant heart, which will strengthen the bird for the intense no-exercise, force-feeding corn-diet phase, during which the enormous, fat livers are formed. The by-products of this luxury item, the flesh and fat of these birds, are important elements in many of the regional specialties of Alsace, and in particular of Périgord.</p>

  <p class="indent">For a long time Hungary, and more recently, Israel, have produced quantities of <em>foie gras</em>, mostly for exportation to France, who is far from being able to produce a sufficient quantity for her own needs. There is no reason that enterprising American farmers could not launch a <em>foie gras</em> industry—traditions of raising and quality feeding would have to be respected, but even in France, the picturesque old peasant lady who moves from one goose to another, force-feeding each through a funnel, has long since been replaced by production-line mechanical force-feeders. Fresh <em>foie gras</em>, aside from the many hot preparations to which it lends itself, when served cold (poached, baked or braised, and kept pink throughout) is of a voluptuousness <a id="page203"></a>and a subtlety undreamed of by those who know only the preserved variety.</p>

  <p class="indent">Although the preserving necessitates a longer cooking and a consequent loss in quality, whole <em>foie gras</em> at best retains a delicate flavor and melts sensuously across the tongue like nothing else. It should be noted that pure, solid, whole <em>foie gras</em> is always described as <em>bloc de foie gras</em>. The other products, variously described as “pâté” (a true <em>pâté de foie gras</em> is a whole <em>foie gras</em> enclosed in pastry), “purée,” or “parfait,” are pastes containing a certain amount of puréed <em>foie gras</em> in combination with other bland meat fillers. A mousse is a purée extended with butter and whipped cream. All may, on their own terms, be perfectly respectable products.</p>

  <p class="indent"><em>Foie gras</em> should be served well chilled, accompanied by freshly made hot thin slices of toast. Butter is superfluous.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c11-s41"><em><span class="color">Fresh Egg Noodles with Truffles</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Pâtes Fraîches aux Truffes</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="extract"><em>Noodle paste:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1½ cups flour</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 whole eggs and 2 yolks</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>a good ½ pound of fresh black truffles</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 cloves garlic</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ pound fresh, unsalted butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, freshly ground pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1–2 tablespoons good cognac (fine-champagne)</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE NOODLES</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Sift the flour and salt, either into a mixing bowl or directly onto a pastry board, make a well in the center, add the whole eggs and yolks, work in the flour, a bit at a time, add, finally, a bit more flour or a bit more egg white, if necessary, to bring the paste to a firm but easily malleable consistency. Make a ball of it, roll it on a lightly floured <a id="page204"></a>board so that the surface will not be sticky and knead it several times, pushing it out flat, away from your person, with the heel of your hand, gathering it back into a compact mass and repeating the operation. Roll it into a ball, wrap it in wax paper, and leave it to “relax” in the refrigerator for an hour or so.</p>

  <p class="indent">Divide the paste into 3 or 4 equal portions, flatten each with the palm of the hand into a regularly formed patty on the floured board, turning it over so that it is evenly coated with flour, and roll it out very thin, turning it over 2 or 3 times during the process and patting it with flour to ensure its sticking neither to the board nor to the rolling pin. These sheets of dough should be allowed to dry for a couple of hours before being cut up. The commonest and most practical home-kitchen method consists in hanging them over broomsticks, the two ends of which are supported by chair backs.</p>

  <p class="indent">Roll up the sheets of dough and, with a good, sharp knife, cut them crosswise into narrow strips approximately ¼ inch in width. Illogical as it appears, noodles seem to taste very differently depending on their width. Lightly and delicately, with the fingertips of both hands, lift masses of these cut, rolled ribbons, toss them in the air, letting them fall into spread-fingered, open hands, and retoss until all are loosely unspiraled. Be certain that no ends remain coiled, and leave them in a loose mass on the floured board until ready for use.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cut the truffles into slices from ⅛ to ¼ inch thick. Peel the garlic cloves without crushing them and rub the bottom and sides of an earthenware <em>poêlon</em> or casserole all over and repeatedly until both cloves have been used. Discard any solid fragments that may cling to the interior. Add half the butter and place the earthenware vessel over a very gentle heat, either in hot ashes or over a tiny flame, protected by an asbestos plaque. When the butter begins to melt, add the sliced truffles, sprinkle with salt, and pepper them generously, regulating the pepper mill to the coarsest grind. Sprinkle a bit of cognac over. (Not too much—its presence should not be suspected. Like the garlic, it is there to reinforce the truffle, rather than to assert its own personality.) Cover the receptacle as tightly as possible and leave it for about 15 minutes over gentle heat, shaking it a bit from time to time. The butter should not even be allowed to come to a bubble—it is not a <a id="page205"></a>cooking process, merely a slow warming that permits the various perfumes to mingle and that of the truffles to expand.</p>

  <p class="indent">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and, after the truffles have been warming in their butter for about 10 minutes, add the noodles to the water, first tossing them in a large sieve to rid them of as much excess flour as possible. Fresh noodles require no more than 4 minutes’ cooking time (it may vary slightly, depending on the stiffness of the dough and the extent to which they have been dried out). Pour them into a large sieve or colander, pour hot water over to rinse, and drain well. Add them to the truffles, toss the contents together lightly, lifting and turning with wooden forks or spoons, and leave, covered, still over low heat, for a few minutes to allow the noodles to become permeated with the truffles and their juices. Toss the contents a couple of times, holding the lid tightly in place and giving an abrupt forward, upward and backward movement to the casserole. Just before serving, bind the noodles by tossing them with the remaining butter, cut into small pieces.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c11-s42"><em><span class="color">Striped Bavarian Cream</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Crème Bavaroise en Rubanée</p>

  <p class="nonindent"><span class="small">NOTE</span>: The proportions given will easily serve 6 or 8, but it is impractical to make a smaller quantity.</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="extract"><em>Raspberry mixture:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ pound frozen raspberries (fresh, in season; those frozen whole and unsweetened seem the best of the frozen)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>sugar</em> (<em>½ cup if unsweetened raspberries are used—otherwise, sugar accordingly)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¾ cup water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 envelope (1 tablespoon) gelatin</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><a id="page206"></a><em>Cream mixture:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup milk</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ vanilla bean (or ½ teaspoon extract)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 egg yolks</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup sugar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ envelope gelatin (½ tablespoon)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 cups heavy cream</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 heaping tablespoons sugar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>a few drops of almond oil or a mild vegetable oil</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">The raspberry mixture should be prepared first so that the two may begin to set coincidentally.</p>

  <p class="indent">Purée the raspberries through a nylon drum sieve. Bring the sugar and water to a boil, stir in the gelatin; first softened in a bit of cold water, and allow mixture to cool almost completely before stirring it into the raspberry purée. Put into the refrigerator while preparing the “cream.” If the raspberry purée should show signs of beginning to set before the “cream” is prepared and cooled, remove it from the refrigerator.</p>

  <p class="indent">Bring the milk and vanilla bean to a boil and leave to infuse for 10 minutes or so. Stir and beat the egg yolks and ½ cup sugar in another saucepan until creamy and light yellow in color, remove the vanilla bean from the milk, and slowly pour the milk into the egg mixture, stirring with a wooden spoon the while. Add the gelatin, first softened in a bit of cold water, and continue stirring constantly over a low-to-medium flame, regularly scraping the sides, corners, and bottom of the saucepan, until the mixture thickens enough to coat the spoon. Under no circumstances should the boiling point be approached. Immerse the saucepan halfway in cold water and continue stirring from time to time to ensure its cooling evenly. When completely cooled, the gelatin will begin to take action. Whip the heavy cream until firm but not stiff, beat in the 2 tablespoons sugar, and incorporate half the whipped cream into each of the two mixtures, stirring and folding thoroughly, but without violence. Oil very lightly the interiors of two decorative quart molds, and carefully, so as to avoid their mixing, pour <a id="page207"></a>in the cream and raspberry mixtures in alternating layers. Put to chill for at least 4 hours embedded in cracked ice, or for from 5 to 6 hours in the coldest part of the refrigerator—but not in the deep-freeze.</p>
