<h1 class="chapter1"><a id="page_181"/>PICI ALLA FABRIZIO</h1>
<h1 class="chapter">fabrizio’s hand-rolled pasta strands</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>Fabrizio and his wife Antonella and daughter Ilaria invited us to their house to help them make ragù (see recipe opposite) and <i>pici</i>. We spent an incredible morning together making stock, drinking coffee, eating wet walnuts and chatting while the pigeons cooked in the pot. The family squabbled happily about who rolled the best <i>pici</i>, and after a hectic few days I felt myself finally slow down to the Tuscan pace of life. We had spent almost the whole day on one dish but what a joy it was. Not just lunch, but an invitation to partake in the skills of the Tuscan kitchen; a wonderful way to spend the day.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 8 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>1 kg (2 lb 3 oz/8 cups) ‘00’ flour</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>3 g (1/5 oz) salt</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 tablespoon oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>500 ml (17 fl oz/2 cups) cold water</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Put the flour in a large bowl and add the salt and oil. Add a little cold water, a splash at a time (you may not need all of it), and mix it into the flour with a wooden spoon. When the dough starts to come together and the spoon is rendered useless, put the dough onto a large wooden board and knead it with your hands. Put the crumbs into a bowl and add a splash more water. Bring that amount into a dough with your hands and then mix the two together. Add a little more flour as necessary and knead for a good 10 minutes until the ball is smooth. Wrap in cling film (plastic wrap) and leave to rest for 30 minutes. (In summer I put it in the fridge but you can leave it out in winter.)</p>
<p class="tx">Keep the bulk of the dough wrapped in cling film so that it doesn’t dry out. Cut a palm-sized piece off and put it onto the table, then roll it out with a rolling pin to a thickness of 3 mm (⅛ in). They should be like thick lengths of spaghetti. Use a pizza cutter to cut the piece into 5 mm- (¼ in-) wide strips. Use your hands to roll the strips into long strands, stretching them as you roll by spreading your fingers out. Leave them separated from one another on a floured board. They can rest here for a few hours or overnight before cooking. To cook, bring a pan of salted water to the boil and cook for 8–10 minutes.</p>
