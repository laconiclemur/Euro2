<p class="paraNoIndent">In Spain, people always kept their cooking utensils and passed them on to their children—and some still do. Gypsies used to travel around the country sharpening knives, repairing pots and pans, and making baskets. They would bang a tune on a frying pan to announce their annual arrival in each town. The Fiesta de Caldereros (Tinkers’ Festival) in Tolosa in February commemorates the tradition with a reenactment of the old activities in Gypsy dress.</p>
<p class="para">I love seeing Spaniards crushing garlic with a pinch of salt in a mortar, grating tomatoes, passing sauces through a conical sieve, and cooking in clay dishes, but at home I have my own ways of performing these tasks. Traditional Spanish utensils are nice to use and look beautiful on the table, but you do not need them to cook any of the dishes in this book, except, perhaps, if you want to make a large paella.</p>
<p class="kitchenpara">• The <span class="italic">paella</span>, a large shallow two-handled pan with slanting sides, used for cooking the dish of the same name, is sold in many sizes. The wide shallow pan allows for even evaporation of the liquid and keeps the different ingredients from disappearing in the rice. Huge paella pans are used for cooking outdoors over a wood fire or on a large gas ring set on a tripod over a butane canister. A heavier pan distributes the heat more evenly when cooking over a conventional stove burner. (According to my friend Lourdes, a specialist in rice and paella, the pan is wrongly called and sold as a <span class="italic">paellera</span>, though some people use that term.)</p>
<p class="kitchenpara">• A <span class="italic">cazuela</span> is a shallow fired-clay dish with a glazed interior. It can be used in the oven and over direct heat on a gas burner (a few good brands can also be used on an electric burner). It distributes and retains heat well. It should last for a few years if treated properly; it may crack eventually, but it is cheap to replace. Before you use a <span class="italic">cazuela</span> for the first time, you must soak it in water for at least 6 hours, then drain it, fill it almost entirely with water, and bring the water slowly to a boil over low heat. Let the water simmer very gently until it has almost evaporated. When cooking in a <span class="italic">cazuela</span> over a burner, it is important to always start on low heat and then turn it up gradually once the rim begins to feel warm. Very high heat is not advisable. You can make soups, stews, braises, and rice dishes in a <span class="italic">cazuela</span>.</p>
<p class="kitchenpara">• <span class="italic">Cocotes</span> are tall clay pots with straight sides and lids.</p>
<p class="kitchenpara">• <span class="italic">Ollas</span> are tall stewing pots with curved sides and lids. Most are metal, but some are made of clay. <span class="italic">Pucheros</span> are tall metal pots with straight sides and lids. Traditional stews are called <span class="italic">ollas</span> and <span class="italic">pucheros</span> after these pots.</p>
<p class="kitchenpara">• A <span class="italic">mortero</span> is a mortar and pestle. These are much used in Spain for crushing garlic and parsley, almonds and other nuts, and fried bread, and to make sauces such as <span class="italic">alioli</span> and romesco. The traditional Spanish <span class="italic">mortero</span> is made of heavy porcelain and has a beautiful yellow glaze, but marble ones are equally good. A blender or food processor and an electric hand mixer can do many of the same jobs very well. A <span class="italic">dornillo</span> is a large wooden mortar used in Andalusia.</p>
<p class="kitchenpara">• A <span class="italic">plancha</span> is a heavy metal two-handled flat griddle. It can also be a flat-top plate that is part of the stove.</p>
<p class="kitchenpara">• A <span class="italic">chino</span> is a conical sieve (a <span class="italic">chinois</span>) with a wooden pestle traditionally used to strain sauces. Today in Spain it is more common to blend sauces to a smooth cream by using an immersion blender straight in the saucepan.</p>
<p class="kitchenpara">• A <span class="italic">salamandra</span> is a heavy metal disk mounted on a long handle. It is heated over a flame and used to caramelize the top of <span class="italic">crema catalana</span> and other desserts. But mini blowtorches are now widely available and just as effective as the traditional salamander.</p>
