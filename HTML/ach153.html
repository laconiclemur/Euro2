<p class="author1"><span class="txit">filetti di pesce in guazzetto di pomodoro e basilico con crostini</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">The simple preparation of this dish makes an elegant meal that is perfect for family and company alike. Select fresh whitefish such as halibut, grouper, snapper, or sea bass. The fresh herbs, tomatoes, potatoes, and onions may be sautéed in an ovenproof casserole in advance and set aside at room temperature. As the family gathers for dinner, lay the fish fillets on top of the vegetables and bake in the short time it will take to set the table and open some wine.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">5 tablespoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 small onion or 2 shallots, thinly sliced</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">5 fresh or canned whole plum tomatoes, peeled and diced</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">8 large fresh basil leaves, chopped</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup dry white wine</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 tablespoons water</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 fish fillets about 1 inch thick (7 ounces each)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 large red potatoes, unpeeled</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 to 8 slices day-old country-style bread</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 clove garlic, cut in half</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Preheat the oven to 375° F.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> In a large ovenproof sauté pan, heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium-low heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until softened and translucent, about 6 minutes. Add the tomatoes, basil, wine, water, and the 2 sliced garlic cloves. Season with salt and pepper and stir to combine. Add the fish, and spoon some of the tomato mixture on top. Cover and place in the oven. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes for thin fillets (snapper or sea <a id="page_307"/>bass) and 20 to 25 minutes for thicker fillets (halibut or cod). The fish is done when it is firm and flakes away when tested with a fork.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Meanwhile, bring a large saucepan filled with salted water to a boil. Add the potatoes and cook until tender when pierced with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes. Cut each potato into <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>-inch-thick slices. Set aside and keep warm.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> During the last 5 minutes of cooking time for the fish, toast the bread slices until lightly browned. Rub each slice with the garlic clove, then brush each slice with some of the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> In the center of four deep plates or shallow soup bowls, arrange equal portions of the sliced potatoes. Top each portion with a fish fillet, and spoon some of the onion-and-tomato sauce over the fish. Garnish with the parsley and serve immediately with the toasted bread.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATIONS</span>:</span> One teaspoon capers, rinsed and patted dry, and a dozen pitted niçoise olives or Calabrese olives may be added to the sauce as a garnish with the parsley. Polenta makes an excellent side dish in the place of the potatoes.</p>
