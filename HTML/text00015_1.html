</h1>
<p class="pf">Even though there were two Lutheran churches in Floodwood, we went to Finnish Lutheran services once a month in Cedar Valley, about twelve miles away. During the cold months we’d usually go to Uncle Frank’s farm, where the traveling <i>pappi</i>
 (pastor) would lead the service. I was baptized at Uncle Frank’s, as were my brothers and sisters. The baptisms were always at the service soonest after our birth.</p>
<p>Uncle Frank’s house was built in the same plan as the old country farmhouses in Finland. You entered a small foyer with a painted floor where one could hang jackets and deposit muddy boots before entering the <i>tupa,</i>
 a large multipurpose kitchen/great room. The tupa had a woodstove and a trestle table, and in the expansive center of the room were a half dozen long wooden benches, all covered with clean and colorful home-woven rag rugs. The room also had a sink that included the convenience of a water pump on its left side. For hot water, you would pump water into a pail and transfer it to a boiler on the woodstove. This was a very modern kitchen in the 1930s and 1940s.</p>
<p>The aroma of boiled coffee and coffee bread, along with the smoke of the woodstove mixed with a kind of sweet “old house” smell, permeated the air. The combination hung on my clothes like incense even after we were home. If I were blindfolded when Uncle Frank and Aunt Mayme came over to visit, I could have identified them just by their smell.</p>
<p>When a service at Uncle Frank’s started, we all sat quietly on the benches. I learned certain phrases in Finnish: “Isän ja pojan ja pyhä hengeen nimeen. Amen” (In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen).</p>
<p>Psalms were sung in Finnish. I could sing by following along in the little book of psalms because Finnish is pronounced exactly the way it is written, but I couldn’t understand a word of the service itself except for <i>Jumala,</i>
 which I knew was the word for God, and <i>Jeesus</i>
 (pronounced “yeesus”) for Jesus.</p>
<p>Pastor Villen, looking very tall against the seven-foot-high ceiling, would launch into his sermon. Whenever I heard this phrase “Tosisesti, tosisesti, minä sanon teille” (Truly, truly, I say onto you), I knew he was quoting Jesus.</p>
<p>I waited for the final “Amen.” That’s when the adults would gather around the table for coffee, and us kids would take off, chasing after one another. We’d play tag and kick the can and hide-and-seek and another game called “anti aye over” where we tossed a ball over the milk shed. My pretty voile dress with the buttons that looked like lingonberries soon hung limply from my shoulders as I’d have lost the belt. One pigtail would come undone, and my white stockings soon had black feet. My shoes were always too small, so I’d have kicked them off. Sweaty and rumpled, we’d finally be invited to the table for nectar (made from a syrup the traveling Rawleigh man sold) and, with it, squares of plain white cake.</p>
<p>On the way home, exhausted, we’d fall asleep in the backseat of the 1939 Packard that my dad felt very lucky to have been able to buy used. It was wartime and they weren’t producing cars. I don’t remember the important details of the car, such as whether it was the last of the V12s that Packard produced—all I remember are the sleek rounded lines, the black running boards, and a cushy backseat that could fit all five of us kids at the time.</p>
