<p class="author1"><span class="txit">lenticchie brasate</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Inspiration for recipes can come from many sources. For this recipe, Gianni was inspired by one of his restaurant patrons. “One day at Le Madri, a very well dressed elderly woman came to the restaurant and ordered this dish. When it was served she asked the waiter if she could speak with me. She explained that she was originally from Morocco, where lentils are a staple. She suggested that the next time I cooked this dish I should add a little fennel at the last moment. I followed her advice and the flavor was amazing. I have prepared it this way ever since.”</p>
<p class="indentb">Serve these lentils as a side dish with grilled fish or lamb or as a topping for bruschetta.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups dried green lentils, picked over and rinsed</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup extra virgin olive oil</span></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">3</sub> cup finely chopped carrots</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">3</sub> cup finely chopped celery</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 bay leaf</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup peeled and crushed tomatoes (about 2 fresh or canned)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 cups chicken broth</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> bulb fresh fennel, very finely chopped or thinly sliced</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Place the lentils in a medium-size saucepan and cover with water to a level 1 inch above the lentils. Bring to a boil and cook to parboil the lentils, about 5 minutes. Drain, rinse in cold water to cool, and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Warm the olive oil in a medium-size saucepan set over medium heat. Add the shallots, carrots, and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are golden, about 8 minutes. Stir in the parsley, bay leaf, and lentils and cook to flavor with the <a id="page_211"/>vegetables, about 2 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, then pour in 3 cups of the chicken broth. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook until the lentils are tender, adding more broth as necessary to keep the liquid just above the lentils, about 15 minutes. Stir in the fennel and cook to flavor the broth, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to rest at least 10 minutes before removing the bay leaf and serving.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATIONS</span>:</span> To add a smoky taste to the basic lentil recipe, add 2 strips bacon, diced, and cook with the shallots, carrots, and celery. And 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice may be stirred into the lentils just before serving to brighten the flavors.</p>
<p class="noindenta">This recipe may also be used to make a delicious lentil soup. Follow the basic recipe, adding 1 peeled and cubed Idaho potato when you add the tomatoes. Increase the broth by 2 cups (for a total of 6 cups). Proceed with recipe as written.</p>
