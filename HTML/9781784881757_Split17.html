<h1 class="chapter"><a id="page_34a"/>beef bone broth</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>This beefy broth is full of goodness and flavour from the bones. Antonella Rossi uses it for the <a href="9781784881757_Split104.html#page_180">Wood Pigeon Ragù</a>. It can also be used to cook pasta or in a soup.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">MAKES APPROX. 1.4 LITRES (2 PINTS/6 CUPS)</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>1 kg (2 lb 3 oz) raw beef bones such as oxtail and shin of beef</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>5 litres (8¾ pints/12¾ cups) cold water</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 medium carrot, roughly chopped, or large handful of carrot peelings</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 large celery stalk, roughly chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>½ large red onion, roughly chopped, or large handful of red onion peelings</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 large tomatoes, quartered</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>good handful of parsley stalks</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 fat garlic clove</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 cloves</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Preheat the oven to 220°C (425°F/Gas 7). Put the bones in a roasting tray and roast for 20 minutes. Carefully remove the bones from the tray, then put them in a large saucepan with the fresh cold water and the rest of the ingredients. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 3 hours. Skim the surface frequently to remove any foam, adding a little more water if the level becomes too low.</p>
<p class="tx">Strain the stock into a large, clean jug or bowl, reserving any large pieces of vegetables to eat cold or use in other recipes. Discard the bones and other flavourings. Use the stock straight away or store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days, or freeze for up to 3 months. To save freezer space, simmer the strained stock for up to 1 hour longer to reduce it and concentrate its flavour.</p>
