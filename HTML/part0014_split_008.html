  <h3 class="h3a">Tiramisu with passito and orange</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">This popular dessert can be seen on menus of Italian restaurants all over the world. It is usually made with espresso coffee and sometimes double (heavy) cream is added, too. To make it less calorific I have simply used mascarpone, which in itself is rich, and to give it a bit of a twist I have used orange juice and a little <em class="calibre4">passito</em>, a Sicilian dessert wine, to soak the biscuits. If you don’t have <em class="calibre4">passito</em> you can use another sweet wine, or if making this for children, omit the alcohol altogether. Make sure you use fresh orange juice, as the bought stuff can be sweet and sickly. Simple to prepare, with no cooking involved, it’s not an ‘instant’ dessert because it is best made the day before and left to set in the fridge.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 egg yolk</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 tbsp caster (superfine) sugar</p>

  <p class="ing1">½ vanilla pod, split lengthways and seeds scraped out</p>

  <p class="ing1">250g/9oz/generous 1 cup mascarpone cheese</p>

  <p class="ing1">175ml/6fl oz/¾ cup freshly squeezed orange juice</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 tbsp <em class="calibre4">passito</em>, or other sweet wine</p>

  <p class="ing1">12 savoiardi biscuits</p>

  <p class="ing1">cocoa powder, sifted, to dust</p>

  <p class="ing2">grated zest of ½ orange</p>

  <p class="para">Combine the egg yolk, sugar and vanilla seeds in a bowl and whisk until creamy. Add the mascarpone and continue to whisk until well mixed. Set aside.</p>

  <p class="para1">Combine the orange juice and wine. Dip the biscuits quickly into this liquid, letting them absorb a little but not too much, otherwise they will fall apart. Line a large glass dish or four individual dishes with some of the biscuits, followed by a layer of the mascarpone mixture and, depending on the size of your dish, continue making layers like this, ending up with the mascarpone. Dust with cocoa powder and top with a little orange zest. Leave in the fridge for at least 6 hours or overnight.</p>
