    <p class="nonindent">The <strong class="calibre13">altopiano</strong>, an enormous plateau in the Alpe di Susi, is a wonderland of grazing cows, green pastures, and wildflowers during the early spring. The charming town of <strong class="calibre13">Ortisei</strong> is well known as a skier’s paradise in the winter. I bring my kids to hike when everything is a lush green and the rich spring milk is being used to make creamy cheese.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Merano</strong> is the most picturesque town in Trentino–Alto Adige, where many of the building façades are decorated with elaborate frescoes. When you stroll down Via Portici, the pastel-colored façades, fountains, and lovely courtyards make the experience even more enjoyable, because you are walking under nine-hundred-year-old porticoes. Make sure to see the surrounding areas, where many fortified castles have remained in exquisite condition, including the Castel Fontana, Castel Torre, and Castel Tirolo.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Bressanone</strong> is Alto Adige’s oldest town. There you’ll find intricate fresco paintings covering many of the arches and vaults of the Cathedral, or the Palace of the Prince-Bishops. A visit to the old pharmacy in the center of town is a must. Owned by the Peer family for the past seven generations, this Pharmacy Museum shows how pharmaceuticals have developed over the years, from the use of pieces of ancient mummies and beaver testicles to modern pills and powders. If Christmas is your favorite holiday, or you just appreciate fine artisan craftsmanship, then stop to see the most amazing nativity scenes, with more than five thousand figures created in wax, wood, ceramic, and papier-māché.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Trento</strong> is famous as the setting for the Council of Trent (1545–1563), which gave rise to the Counter-Reformation. There are many places to visit, but my favorite is the Castello di Buonconsiglio, which overlooks the city. Inside, the frescoes of the <em class="calibre4">Labors of the Month</em> give an accurate portrayal of medieval life, highlighting everyday activities.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Lake Toblino</strong> is dramatically placed between snow-covered mountains and is on a small piece of land that juts out into Lake Garda. The site of a tragic romance between Prince-Bishop Carlo Emanuele Madruzzo and the young Claudia Particella, the castle today is a restaurant and a romantic place to enjoy magnificent scenery. In the early morning, when the fog rises off the lake, you can sit and ponder the poisoning of Claudia by the bishop to cover up their love affair.</p>

    <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page29"></a><strong class="calibre13">Bolzano</strong>’s most picturesque spot is Piazza delle Erbe, with its many painted façades and daily produce market. In the former Dominican monastery nearby, the Chapel of St. John has Giottesque frescoes which are quite surprising. The <em class="calibre4">Triumph of Death</em> is one of the best. Action-packed, with arms flailing and horses writhing, the scene depicted reveals expressions on the characters’ faces that are incredibly individualistic and intense.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Castel Roncolo</strong>, a short drive or a pleasant bicycle ride from the town of Bolzano, northward along the Talvera River, will take you to some of the most important examples of chivalrous medieval frescoes, which tell the stories of King Arthur and Tristan and Isolde. Although well preserved, the frescoes are ghosts of the originals, and yet the hunting scenes are alive with movement, and the jousting scenes portray vividly the excitement of courtly games.—T<span class="small1">ANYA</span></p>
