<h2 class="h2b" id="page166">CONFIT DE TOMATES</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Oven-dried Tomatoes</em></h3>
<p class="normall">Confit <em>is a lovely word that encapsulates the treatment given to many different ingredients to concentrate their flavours naturally. There is no real English equivalent. The tomatoes shrivel and dry, intensifying the flavour and darkening the fruit to a deep crimson. In Provence we get such an overload of cherry tomatoes, both red and yellow, through the summer until late September, that we dry them, simply cut in half, for the same length of time</em>.</p>
<p class="normalla0"><em>The tomatoes are wonderful in salad, with fresh goats’ cheese or mozzarella, or just eaten as a delicious aperitif, with the oil dripping down your wrists</em>.</p>

<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FILLS 1 × 500g (1lb 2oz) JAR</span><br/>
6 large, very ripe tomatoes, or 500g (18oz) cherry tomatoes, halved<br/>
4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra to cover<br/>
1 large sprig savory or thyme, leaves picked from the stalks<br/>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>
Caster sugar</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 60°C/140°F/the lowest gas possible.</p>
<p class="normala">Cut a light cross in the tops of the tomatoes with a sharp knife. Blanch them in boiling water then refresh in iced water. As soon as they are cold drain them, skin them, cut them in half and remove the seeds. Put the tomato halves in a bowl and mix with 4 tablespoons olive oil, the savory and some salt, sugar and pepper. Turn them flesh side down on to a non-stick tray or a cooling rack over the top of a tray.</p>
<p class="normala">Dry the tomatoes in the very low oven for about 6 hours (or overnight). They should shrink to approximately half their size and be pleasantly chewy. Eat immediately, or put in a jar and cover carefully with extra oil. They will keep, in the oil, in the fridge for a couple of weeks.</p>
