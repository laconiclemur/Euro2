<p class="image"><a id="page_166"/><a id="page_167"/><img alt="image" src="../images/09fig00.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Hulda Garborg was one of the most influential Norwegian women’s activists of the 1890s, and the wife of author and social reformer Arne Garborg. The couple was among the first Norwegian members of the European intellectual vanguard. They traveled widely on the Continent, partaking of bohemian life. At home they advocated modern causes such as women’s rights and free love. They criticized the authority of the church and embraced socialism and, in its turn, anarchism—then they distanced themselves from both when the doctrines became too dogmatic. At the same time, they were instrumental in the dawning nationalist movement, as champions for Norwegian independence and self-awareness.</p>
<p class="indent">It was as a part of this struggle that Hulda published her cookbook <em>Heimstell (Housekeeping)</em> in 1898. Her aim was to encourage Norwegians, especially those living in the rural areas, to take pride in their own food traditions and not just copy the urban elite’s French- and Danish-inspired <a id="page_170"/>bourgeois cuisine, which Hulda found insipid and unsuitable for Norway.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Heimstell</em> is one of the first truly Norwegian cookbooks and an interesting example of two important trends in Norwegian cultural life: nationalism and internationalism. Because of our long history of being governed by our neighbors, first by Denmark from the fifteenth century to 1814, and then as the junior partner in a union with Sweden until 1905, these two seemingly conflicting ideologies have often appeared together. Both building national identity and linking up with the broader international society were seen as ways of opposing the semicolonial rulers in Stockholm and Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="indent">But there was one major obstacle in the making of Hulda the cookbook author: She couldn’t cook. When Hulda married Arne in 1887, she admitted, “I do not know how to make <em>any</em> kind of food.” Among friends she had a reputation for being an exceptionally bad cook. So when, in the early 1890s, she started to write a food column in a newspaper, it was considered a joke by many. But while most cookbook writers at the time were copying prestigious French books, addressing an almost nonexistent elite and giving advice on how to entertain in grand style (“If the sauce breaks, beat in 20 more egg yolks and have the maid beat the sauce energetically for another 45 minutes,” says one classic nineteenth-century cookbook), Hulda’s relative inexperience served as an advantage. She acknowledged her own weaknesses and, unlike her colleagues, she actually researched her writing. She talked to people about what they considered to be good Norwegian food, she interviewed peasant wives to find out how they made their regional specialties, and she tried to re-create the simple, good food she had been served on her journeys, especially to France.</p>
<p class="indent">“I feel passionately that we, in cooking as in everything else, must build on our own traditions. Build on our own traditions, and from there expand our view and our knowledge,” she wrote in 1925, toward the end of her life. Despite her own faults as a cook, her influence in defining Norwegian food is indisputable.</p>

<p class="noindentt"><small><strong>IN ORDER FOR THE MARINADE TO PENETRATE THE MEAT, YOU SHOULD LET IT MARINATE IN THE FRIDGE FOR 2 TO 3 DAYS. (IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THAT MUCH TIME, LET IT MARINATE FOR 2 TO 3 HOURS AT ROOM TEMPERATURE.)</strong></small></p>
</div>
<p class="noindents">SERVES 8</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>One 4-pound boneless sirloin roast or beef tenderloin roast</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon coarse sea salt</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons crushed black peppercorns</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 garlic cloves, crushed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup grain vodka</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Rub the roast with the salt and pepper. Place it in a resealable plastic bag. Add the parsley, 2 tablespoons of thyme, and the garlic and pour in the vodka and olive oil. Seal the bag and place it in a bowl in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days, turning the bag twice a day so the meat marinates evenly.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Let the meat stand at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours before cooking.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Preheat the oven to 425°F.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Take the meat out of the plastic bag; reserve the marinade. Heat a large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add the vegetable oil and heat until hot. Sear the roast on all sides, about 4 to 6 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Transfer the meat to a baking pan. Place a meat thermometer in the thickest part of the roast. Roast in the middle of the oven, turning once, for 1 to 1¼ hours (25 to 30 minutes if using tenderloin), until the thermometer (or an instant-read thermometer) registers 130°F for medium-rare; before the roast is done, pour the reserved marinade over it. Transfer the meat to a cutting board and let it rest, uncovered, for at least 20 minutes. Set the baking dish aside.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Just before serving, pour the cooking juices into a saucepan and heat gently. Stir in the butter. Season with salt and pepper and the remaining thyme. Strain the sauce and discard the herbs.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Carve the meat and arrange on a platter with the sauce on the side.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindent">This dish was featured on <em>New Scandinavian Cooking</em> when we filmed in Svalbard, an Arctic island in the polar ice to the north of northern Norway. The vodka was the only thing that did not freeze on the way to the university where I did the cooking.</p>

<p class="noindents">SERVES 8</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>One 4-pound beef tenderloin roast or boneless sirloin roast, if preferred</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About 2 teaspoons crushed black peppercorns (see <a class="nounder" href="ch09.html#ch09_note1">Note</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons grated ginger, or more to taste</strong></p>

<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Rub the roast with the pepper. Place the meat in a resealable plastic bag.</p>
<p class="noindentt">To prepare the marinade, combine the ginger, garlic, oil, soy sauce, lemon juice, and herbs in a bowl. Mix well and pour the marinade into the plastic bag. Remove most of the air from the bag and seal it carefully. Place the meat in a bowl (in case the bag leaks) and set it in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days, turning the bag twice a day so the meat is evenly marinated. (If you’re pressed for time, marinate the meat at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours, turning it occasionally.)</p>
<p class="noindentt">Let the meat stand at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours before roasting it. (It is easier to get good, even results when the meat is not cold.)</p>
<p class="noindentt">Preheat the oven to 350°F.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Remove the roast from the bag; set the marinade aside. Scrape the seasonings off the roast with a spoon or a butter knife (as the ginger and garlic are likely to burn during the searing and the first roasting). Rub the roast with salt, pepper, and about 1 tablespoon of the butter.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Heat a large nonstick skillet over high heat. Sear the roast on all sides until browned; this should take about 4 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Transfer the roast to a baking pan. Place a meat thermometer, if you have one, in the middle of the roast. Roast in the middle of the oven for <a id="page_175"/>40 minutes. Take the roast out of the oven, turn it over, and let it rest, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 300°F.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Pour the reserved marinade over the roast and roast for an additional 20 to 30 minutes, or until the thermometer (or an instant-read thermometer) registers 135°F for medium-rare, 145°F for medium. Transfer the meat to a cutting board and let it rest, uncovered, for at least 20 minutes. (If you keep the meat thermometer in the roast, you will notice that the temperature increases a few degrees, and then very slowly starts to decrease.) Set the baking dish aside.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Just before serving, pour the pan juices and any juices that have collected on the carving board into a small saucepan and simmer for 2 minutes. Strain the liquid through a metal sieve lined with a piece of cheesecloth and return it to the pan. Season with lemon juice, salt, and/or ginger, if necessary. Stir in the rest of the butter; do not let the sauce boil.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Carve the meat and arrange on a platter and serve with the sauce on the side.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><a id="ch09_note1"/><strong><small>NOTE:</small></strong> If you do not have a pepper mill or a mortar and pestle, you can crush the peppercorns on a cutting board or other hard surface using the bottom of a skillet.</p>

<p class="image"><a id="page_176"/><img alt="image" src="../images/09fig05.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Suddenly I am surrounded by goats. One offers her head for me to scratch, another nibbles at my trousers, and a third investigates my shoes, without finding anything of interest. When Lars Tyssebotn, a sturdy farmer in his late forties, lets his goats out in the morning, nothing even remotely edible is safe. The goats crowd the hillside and will not let anybody, particularly not an exotic city boy like me with funny clothes and funny smells of unknown things, pass without a thorough inspection.</p>
<p class="indent">Lars is a maverick, one of by Norway’s few remaining goat farmers. His goats are allowed to live life as nature intended, roaming the hillsides, eating whatever they can find. Once a necessary and much-appreciated part of every farm, goats are not particularly popular anymore, and their often-tough meat and strong-tasting milk fail to compete with other meats and milk, although goat milk still has its role in the production of goat cheese.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two main goat cheese varieties in Norway, one a white cheese, not unlike the French <em>chèvres,</em> which is produced only to a very limited extent and considered a rarity. Far more important is brown goat cheese, <em>gjetost,</em> also known as Norwegian fudge cheese (a version of which can be found in American stores under the name of Ski Queen; see <a class="nounder" href="source.html#page_294">Mail-Order Sources</a>). This brown goat cheese is the most important cheese in Norway, and for many it is a part of the daily diet, eaten with bread for breakfast or lunch.</p>
<p class="indent">Brown goat cheese is one of the most peculiar cheeses in the world and has no known relatives. It has a light brown color, a smooth fudgelike texture, and a mild sweet caramel flavor, with a tinge of goat. Its production is also quite different from that of other cheeses; it’s made from whey, not milk, so technically it is not a cheese at all, but a fudge. But to all Norwegians, that distinction is only of academic interest; it has always been viewed and treated as a cheese.</p>
<p class="indent">Making cheese from whey was probably a result of poverty. The goats were cherished for their impressive survival skills and their limited demand for feed. When they were on their summer pasture, <a id="page_178"/>they found food in the mountains and produced plenty of milk. The rest of the year, though, they had to make do with scraps and leaves, and they hardly gave milk. But during the summer there was even more milk than needed, so the surplus had to be conserved somehow for the hard winters; making cheese from whey was a way to make sure that nothing went to waste. Throughout the eighteenth century, the sweet fudge cheese grew to be more popular than the original white goat cheese, and today the whey is considered the main asset and the milk a by-product.</p>
<p class="indent">Watching Lars make brown goat cheese is an interesting experience. In his small production room next to the barn, the cheese is made almost the same way it was by dairymaids a hundred years ago; the only difference is that Lars has an electric cooker with rotating arms to make production easier. The pale white whey is boiled for ten to twelve hours under constant stirring. The whey is condensed through evaporation, and after a few hours, when most of the water has evaporated, the sugars in the whey start to caramelize, and it slowly turns a light brown. Controlling the process, making sure that there is sufficient caramelization without the cheese being burned, requires skill and precision. The cooking continues until what remains is a thick brown fudge, whereupon Lars pours the cheese into molds and covers them with wax.</p>
<p class="indent">The brown goat cheese has an overwhelmingly sweet flavor that does not easily combine with other foods. Therefore, it is generally eaten with bread or <em>lefse,</em> the Norwegian potato cake, and only rarely used in cooking. One exception is the traditional sauce to accompany moose, reindeer, or venison, where the intense sweetness blends with the gamy flavors of the meat.</p>
<p class="indent">In Norway, moose and reindeer meat are much more common than venison, but the area of western Norway where Lars’s farm is located is full of deer that often graze right outside his house. Lars is an ardent hunter, and he hunts with much of the same <a id="page_179"/>care and respect for nature he shows with his goats. He does not want to join a shooting party because he feels chasing the animals unnecessarily will upset them, which is not good for the animals and will affect the quality of their meat. Instead, he shoots the deer on his own farm, sometimes waiting for them just outside the house. The venison with brown goat cheese sauce I had at Lars’s farm was so good I feared that I would never taste anything like it again. But I have made the same dish several times in the States, and although I do not have the privilege of having walked the same field as the deer and having been nibbled at by the goat, the flavors are not all that different.</p>
