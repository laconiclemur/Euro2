<p class="tx2"><b>Our friend Antonella Secciani told us of her father’s favourite treat in the height of summer: if he spotted a perfectly ripe peach he would pick it from his <i>orto</i> (allotment), slice it, and drop it into his glass of red wine. After just a few minutes he would eat the peach and drink the wine.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 4–6 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>4 large ripe peaches (or nectarines)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>25 g (1 oz) caster (superfine) sugar</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>juice of ½ lemon</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>500 ml (17 fl oz/2¼ cups) red wine</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Wash the peaches in cold water. Cut them in half and remove the stones, then cut them into 1 cm (½ in) wedges. Put them in a bowl with the sugar and lemon juice, and leave in the fridge for 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="tx">Divide the peach slices between 4–6 glasses and top each one with red wine. Leave in the fridge again to macerate for up to 2 hours. Encourage your guests to spear the peaches with a fork then drink the peach-flavoured wine.</p>
