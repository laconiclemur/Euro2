<h1 class="chapter">chicken meatloaf</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>Inspired by the meatloaves and stuffed meats in the butcher’s shops and market stalls of Tuscany, this is our recipe for an easy supper that our whole family loves. Serve it warm as it is, or with the <a href="9781784881757_Split22.html#page_40">Homemade Tomato Sauce</a>. We even like it cold the following day with mayonnaise and a green salad. The mixture can also be used to make small patties for canapés, large ones resembling burgers, or to stuff vegetables (see <a href="9781784881757_Split110.html#page_190">stuffed vegetables</a>).</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 6 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for greasing and frying</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>500 g (1 lb 2 oz) minced (ground) chicken</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 white onion, peeled and finely chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>100 g (3½ oz/generous ⅓ cup) ricotta</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>large handful of parsley, finely chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 tablespoons fresh oregano, or 1 teaspoon dried oregano</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>100 g (3½ oz) finely grated Pecorino</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 teaspoons salt</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 eggs</b></p>
<p class="tx3"><b>TO SERVE</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>sprigs of oregano, thyme or rosemary (optional)</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F/Gas 4) and grease a 1 lb (22 × 12 × 6 cm/8½ × 5 × 2½ in) loaf tin with a little olive oil.</p>
<p class="tx">To make the meatloaf, mix all the ingredients together in a bowl. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a small non-stick frying pan. To test the flavour of the meatloaf, take a walnut-sized ball of the mixture, flatten it into a patty shape and fry it in the oil until cooked through. It should be firm to the touch and any juices should run clear when it is pierced with a skewer. Allow to cool for a couple of minutes, then taste for seasoning. (I have realised many a time that my mixture needs more oomph and have added more seasoning, more cheese or herbs at this point, so it is always good to test it.) Adjust the seasoning as necessary and spoon the mixture into the greased loaf tin.</p>
<p class="tx">Put the loaf tin into a roasting dish and fill the dish with cold water until it comes halfway up the tin, to make a bain marie. This will create steam in the oven which will prevent the meatloaf becoming dry while it cooks. Cook for 50 minutes–1 hour or until the meatloaf feels very firm to the touch or the internal temperature reaches 75–80°C (170–175°F) on a probe (meat) thermometer. The juices should run clear when pierced through to the centre.</p>
<p class="tx">Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes in the tin, then turn the meatloaf out onto a warm serving platter with any juices from the tin poured over the loaf. I like to decorate it with fresh herbs to serve.</p>
