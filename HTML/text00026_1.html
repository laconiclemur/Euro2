 TOASTED TEACAKES WITH CINNAMON DATE BUTTER</h2>
<p class="rec_intro" id="nad0002558">
<em>When my youngest child was born I suddenly had three kids under the age of four! While my older two went to nursery for the afternoon, I would sometimes tear myself away from the housework, and treat myself to fruit toast and an Earl Grey tea. I love the tart, sticky fruit in a warm toasted teacake. But while my daughter could easily eat her way through six tiny boxes of raisins in a walk to the park, if they were baked into something she simply would not touch them, picking them out and flinging them aside. So I created this recipe for her, and for anyone who doesn’t like raisins. The teacakes are served with a delicious homemade butter that’s sweetened with sticky dates. There’s nothing better.</em>

<p class="method" id="nad0002577">
<span class="red">
<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 For the teacakes, place the milk and butter in a jug or small bowl and microwave until the butter has melted – or you can do this in a small pan. Don’t boil the milk, just warm it enough for the butter to melt. Then whisk in the egg and set aside.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002578">
<span class="red">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Place the flour in the bowl of a stand mixer, then add the salt to one side of the bowl, yeast on the other side, and the cinnamon, orange zest and caster sugar. Give it all a mix and make a well in the centre. Pour in the milk mixture and give it all a good stir to just combine.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002579">
<span class="red">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Attach the dough hook to the mixer and knead on medium speed for 5 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. If you are doing it by hand, knead the dough on a lightly oiled surface for 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002580">
<span class="red">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Put the dough back into the bowl, then cover with cling film and leave in a warm place for at least an hour, until the dough has doubled in size. This will depend on how warm the room is, so don’t fret if it takes longer than an hour.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002581">
<span class="red">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Grease two baking trays lightly with a little oil.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002582">
<span class="red">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Once proved, take the dough and knock out the air by pushing it down with your knuckles. Roll it out into a sausage shape and cut it into six equal pieces. Roll each one into a ball, then, using a spoon, flatten them so they are about 1cm thick and place on the baking trays. Take two pieces of cling film and lightly oil them. Cover the dough with the cling film, oil side down and leave to prove again for 1 hour in a warm place.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002584">
<span class="red">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Meanwhile, start the cinnamon and date butter. Put the dates into a bowl, pour over the hot water and set aside for 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002585">
<span class="red">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 Put <a id="pg35"></a>
 the cream into the bowl of a stand mixer and begin whisking. Now this is the fun bit. No need to worry about over-whipping, because this is exactly what you want to do. From start to finish, the process will take 5 minutes with the mixer on high. As soon as the cream has gone from soft peaks, to stiff peaks, to over-whipped, the cream will start to gather and look almost crumbly. You will know it is ready when you can see water in the base of the bowl. Now you have butter.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002586">
<span class="red">
<strong>9.</strong>
</span>
 Place a sieve over a bowl and pour the mixture in. Leave the water to drip through the sieve. You can help the process along by pressing the butter against the sieve using the back of a spoon.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002587">
<span class="red">
<strong>10.</strong>
</span>
 Once the teacake dough has proved, preheat the oven to 190°C/170°C fan/gas 5. Take off the cling film and bake the teacakes for 15–20 minutes. Then take them out of the oven and leave to cool on a wire rack.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002588">
<span class="red">
<strong>11.</strong>
</span>
 Transfer the soft drained butter into a bowl.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002589">
<span class="red">
<strong>12.</strong>
</span>
 Drain the dates and squeeze out the water. Blitz the dates roughly and add to the butter with the salt and cinnamon. Mix well, then cover and chill in the fridge until needed.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002590">
<span class="red">
<strong>13.</strong>
</span>
 To serve, slice the teacakes in half, toast them and spread with the date butter.</p>
