    <p class="nonindent1_break"><a id="page281"/><span class="C_COTX"><span class="dk_blue"><a id="ind329a"/>Johanna Thorvaldsdóttir</span></span> was studying to be a nurse in <a id="ind505a"/>Reykjavík until she heard that Iceland’s <a id="ind222a"/><a id="ind258a"/>goat population, a unique species on the planet, had fallen to fewer than seventy animals. Virtually overnight, Johanna made the decision to sacrifice the future she had planned for herself to nearly single-handedly save the Icelandic goat population from extinction.</p>
<p class="extract">Iceland’s goats now number over one thousand, and their products—milk, cheese, meat—are finding their way back into the marketplace. In the past, goat meat and dairy products were popular with Icelanders. Gunnar remembers his grandmother waxing fondly about the rich goat’s milk that once graced her table, but until a few years ago, he had never tasted Icelandic goat’s milk himself.</p>
<p class="extract">It is only because of pioneers like Johanna that the Icelanders are once again able to taste the products enjoyed by their ancestors. During a visit with Johanna, she gave Gunnar two quarts of goat’s milk in old-fashioned glass bottles. Back at Dill, he transformed the milk into an impossibly silky ice cream. With his first bite, he began to cry. The ice cream was certainly good, but not enough to elicit tears, and the other chefs in the kitchen wondered what inspired such emotion, until they realized it was the first time Gunnar had ever tasted goat’s milk, which caused the memories of his grandmother’s stories to come flooding back.</p>
<p class="extract">Gunnar served Johanna’s ice cream that night at Dill, the waiters explaining to guests its significance on the menu. As they took their first bite, the same wave of joy that washed over Gunnar’s face earlier in the day washed over theirs. It illustrated how important Gunnar’s cuisine is to his nation. It is not simply about serving resplendent food in a radiant setting. It is also about preserving a way of life. By connecting modern diners to producers like Johanna at the tables of Dill, he helps Johanna continue her work and pass on the tradition to the next generation.</p>
<h2 class="A2" id="c12-s86"><a id="page282"/><span class="dk_blue">A Conversation with Goat Farmer Johanna Thorvaldsdóttir</span></h2>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Have you always been a goat farmer?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">No, I was studying to be a nurse in <a id="ind506a"/>Reykjavík before I decided to take over the farm. My father never wanted me to raise goats, but I’ve loved them ever since I was a child.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> How many goats did you have when you began farming?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">I started out with three goats, and then in 1999, I bought a group of fifty. I now have over three hundred goats. It’s important to raise a large number to prevent inbreeding. Today, many of Iceland’s goats are owned by hobby farmers who keep them as pets, which makes it difficult to encourage diversity.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> What is the history of goats in Iceland?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">When the first settlers arrived in the ninth century, they brought a lot of goats with them. They were easy to carry, provided a lot of milk, and required very little food. During the seventeenth century, the climate turned colder and volcanic eruptions disturbed the air quality. I believe that during this time, many of the goats perished, and the people turned to sheep for wool and food. Goats could not provide the fatty meat that was needed during the harsh winters. People started to lose their interest in goats, and only poorer citizens kept them. Goats gained a reputation for being the animals of the destitute.</p>
<p class="Answer">After World War II, people became more affluent and started to grow their own gardens, which the goats, of course, loved. That prompted laws against keeping goats in smaller communities because they were eating the gardens. The newfound wealth also meant that Icelanders turned to expensive imports from other parts of the world.</p>
<p class="Answer">It seemed that only older women continued to believe in the nutritional benefits of goat’s milk, and they were often the primary goat keepers. There are old tales of elderly women with perfect teeth because of their preference for goat’s milk. But the younger generations soon lost their taste for the milk. Goats nearly went extinct in Iceland during the last century, which is why I decided to take up their cause. If I didn’t do it, I’m not sure if anyone would have, and they might have disappeared forever.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> What products do you produce from your goats?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">Goats are not able to grow fat on the outside, but they don’t have the ability to get rid of their fat, or tallow, on the inside. I use the tallow along with a variety of herbs and flowers from my gardens to make soaps and creams. I believe in the health benefits of these products. I also sell goatskins. I try to collect their cashmere—that is, the under layer of their <a id="page283"/>coats—but it’s difficult because it requires extensive brushing, and I do not have the time or help I need to do it. I am working with a dairy in the area to produce goat’s milk and also to produce sausages and ice cream. Once my goats are slaughtered, I try to use each and every part of them. It would be a disgrace not to.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Where do you find information about caring for your goats and making your products?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">It’s difficult, as there is so little written information about goats in Iceland. Because they almost disappeared, this knowledge was lost through neglect and disinterest. Even my veterinarian has had a hard time learning how to care for my goats, which are a unique species, and some aspects of other goat species differ from Icelandic goats. I have visited goat farms in Italy to learn, and I have trained in Norway to make cheese. I have been told by the organizers of <a id="ind580a"/>Slow Food in Italy that if I am able to make cheese from unpasteurized milk, my cheese will be designated a slow food. But in Iceland, I will never be allowed to do this.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Why not?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">It’s the same as in the United States; authorities believe drinking <a id="ind381a"/>raw milk is dangerous. All dairy here must be pasteurized. It amazes me that people think they will die if they drink a healthful thing like raw milk, yet they are fine with feeding their children food loaded with preservatives and other chemicals. People who visit the farm sometimes ask to buy raw milk, and I do sell it to some families who have children with allergies. There is a protein missing in goat’s milk that enables these children to process the milk, unlike cow’s milk. It is a shame not to be able to sell my raw milk and produce unpasteurized cheese. But it is the nature of our industrialized society that prevents it.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Do you receive any funding from the government?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">Very little. I have gone to the minister of agriculture and begged for help, but because goats are considered hobby animals in Iceland, the government provides only a small subsidy for up to twenty animals. That’s not very helpful when you have over three hundred. The government has yet to see the importance of protecting a species unique to the world. Since the economic crisis, the interest rates on loans have soared as a means of paying back the national debt. It has put an additional burden on small family farms like mine. I do have renewed hope, though. In recent years, the number of visitors to the farm has skyrocketed. There is much more interest in Icelandic goats than there was just a few years ago. Many of my visitors come from around the world, but what makes me happiest is welcoming the large number of Icelanders who come to <a id="ind285a"/>Háafell. They have begun to realize the value and beauty of this nation’s goats, and I am hoping that this will help my family and, in turn, help our goats. I have given up a lot for them, but I believe in them, and it lightens my burden a little to see Icelanders are beginning to believe in them again, too.</p>

<div class="headnote">This beautifully constructed appetizer, with its vibrant colors and carefully assembled elements, was one of the first dishes Gunnar served when he opened Dill, and it has appeared often on the menu ever since. Gunnar changes his menu frequently based on available ingredients, but this recipe is a mainstay, for it is a true celebration of all that Iceland has to offer. The celery root, used three ways, illustrates the creativity Gunnar employs when creating his dishes and pays homage to a humble root vegetable by showcasing it. The incorporation of goat farmer <a id="ind330a"/>Johanna Thorvaldsdóttir’s goat cheese pays homage to a producer whom Gunnar deeply respects.</div>

<p class="IL_item"><strong>Garden cress, for garnish</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">To make the celery root, using a mandoline (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03-note13">see notes</a>) or knife, cut 4 slices of celery root, each ⅛ inch (3 mm) thick. Using a 2-inch (5-cm) round cutter, punch out 8 disks from the slices. Chop the remaining celery root (including the leftover bits from the slices) into ¼-inch (6-mm) pieces.</div>
<div class="method">Bring a saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add the celery root disks, blanch for a few seconds, drain, and pat dry with paper towels. Repeat the process with the chopped celery root. Cover and refrigerate all of the celery root until chilled.</div>
<div class="method"><a id="page285"/>To make the herb cream, prepare an ice bath. Bring a saucepan of water to a vigorous boil. Using a slotted spoon, lower the egg into the water and cook at a vigorous boil for 3½ minutes. Transfer the egg to the ice bath until well chilled. Remove the egg from the ice bath and immediately crack it lightly on all sides on a flat surface. Peel the egg, put it in a blender, and add the shallots, garlic, dill, and parsley. Process on high speed for about 3 minutes, until smooth. Add the oil in a slow, steady stream and process for about 1 minute longer, until the consistency of thick mayonnaise. Fold in the chopped celery root, season with salt and vinegar, cover, and refrigerate until chilled.</div>
<div class="method">To make the goat cheese foam, combine the milk and cheese in a saucepan over medium heat and heat, stirring frequently to prevent scorching, until the cheese melts. Season with salt and lemon juice and whisk in the soy lecithin. Process with an immersion blender until foamy.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, in a bowl, toss together the goat cheese, roe, and crispy rye bread. Place the 2-inch (5-cm) round cutter on a plate, and put one of the celery root disks inside the cutter. Top with a mound of the herb cream about 1 inch (2.5 cm) tall, and then top with a second disk. Carefully lift off the cutter, top the second disk with a spoonful of the roe mixture, and garnish with cress. Process the foam a second time, if necessary, and spoon it over the cress.</div>

<div class="headnote1">Angelica flourishes in the pastures surrounding Johanna Thorvaldsdóttir’s goat farm in <a id="ind286a"/>Háafell. In this recipe, Gunnar pickles it and serves it with dry-aged beef that is gently seared a golden brown but not completely cooked through, in order to showcase the virtues of the beef. Dry-aged beef is meat that has been hung and slowly aged. It speaks to Gunnar’s love for preservation and is a new twist on the Icelandic smoked lamb he admires.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent">Dry-aged beef has become a popular item in restaurants outside of Iceland, and if you have trouble sourcing it locally, it is widely available online. Gunnar pairs the beef with smoked bone marrow, which enhances it with a smokiness that complements its tenderness. He uses several ingredients to garnish the dish, including <em><a id="ind368a"/>maríustakkur</em>, an Icelandic version of lemon balm that is nearly impossible to find outside of Iceland.</div>
<div class="ingredient">
<p class="IL_head_top"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>VEGETABLE STRINGS</strong></span></p>

</div>
<div class="method"><a id="page289"/>To make the vegetable strings, put the carrot, celery root, and rutabaga each in its own small heatproof glass jar. Combine the vinegar, water, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Pour the hot liquid over the vegetables, dividing it evenly and immersing them. Let cool to room temperature, then cap tightly and refrigerate for 24 hours. Drain when ready to serve.</div>
<div class="method">To make the aged beef, preheat the oven to 200°F (95°C). Melt enough butter with some oil in an ovenproof sauté pan over low heat to generously coat the bottom of the pan. Once it is hot, add the beef and herbs and fry gently, turning once and basting with the oil and butter the entire time, just until the beef begins to turn golden brown on both sides. Let rest for about 7 minutes, turning once as it rests to evenly distribute the juices.</div>
<div class="method">Discard the herbs, transfer the pan to the oven, and cook the beef until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 131°F (55°C). Let the beef rest at room temperature for 20 minutes, keeping the oven on. Return the beef to the oven for 1 minute, then return the beef to the stove top and sauté the beef in the butter and oil, turning once, until caramelized. Season with salt and slice when ready to serve.</div>
<div class="method">To smoke the bone marrow, arrange wood chips or dried onion peels on the bottom of a deep hotel pan lined with foil. Place the bone marrow directly in a perforated hotel pan that fits inside the first pan and place over high heat. Ignite the chips or peels with a kitchen torch and place the pan over low heat. When the flame is nearly extinguished, place the perforated pan on top and seal the entire set-up securely with aluminum foil. Allow the smoke to smolder out completely, about 20 minutes, before removing the foil. Season with salt.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, arrange the beef slices and marrow on a plate, top with the vegetable strings, garnish with the lemon balm and angelica stalks, and sprinkle with the leek and onion ash. Place a spoonful of angelica butter alongside the beef and drizzle everything with the herb oil.</div>
<div class="note" id="c12-note45">
<p class="note_head"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>NOTES</strong></span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">Removing uncooked marrow from a beef bone often results in a globular mess of marrow and blood. The trick is to soak the bones in lightly salted water in the refrigerator for 12 to 24 hours. This causes the marrow to seize up, which makes it easier to pop it out of the bone. The long soak also helps to leach out much of the blood.</span></p>

<p class="Essays_header"><a id="page290"/><span class="dk_blue"><a id="ind643a"/><a id="ind357a"/>VIKING STOCK</span></p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">The earliest Norse settlers in Iceland carried animals on board their long ships to sustain them through the long, dark winters when the sun doesn’t rise for weeks and the only lights visible are the glassy, streaking purple, green, and red ribbons of the northern lights. They brought with them <a id="ind223a"/><a id="ind259a"/>goats, cows, horses, <a id="ind143a"/>chickens, pigs, geese, and sheep that they slaughtered in the fall, smoking their meat or fermenting it in whey to eat through the winter.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">In Iceland, strict laws prohibit any animal that leaves the nation from returning, in order to prevent cross-breeding and the introduction of diseases. New breeds are not allowed into Iceland, save for the recent arrival of new pig and chicken breeds because of the scarcity of the original breeds. This has resulted in pure breeds with lineages that can be traced back to the Vikings and that have changed little, if at all, over the centuries.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">It seems appropriate then to refer to these breeds as “Viking stock,” and Icelanders take great pride in the unique species of animals that roam their countryside. There have been a few disasters over the centuries, such as when the pig was allowed to go extinct in the sixteenth century (see <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c07_r1.htm#page166">this page</a>) and the recent near-extinction of the Icelandic goat. But thanks to pioneers like goat farmer <a id="ind331a"/>Johanna Thorvaldsdóttir, it is nearly assured that the unique Icelandic goat species will survive.</p>

<p class="Essays_header"><span class="dk_blue"><a id="ind598a"/>DISTILLED SPIRITS OF ICELAND</span></p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">Distilled spirits such as <a id="ind538a"/>schnapps and <a id="ind651a"/>vodka have long been consumed in Iceland. One of the best-known of these alcoholic beverages is <em><a id="ind93a"/>brennivín</em>, a clear caraway-spiked schnapps sold in a green bottle with a black label that was designed to discourage people from purchasing it, to no avail. Also known as “black death,” <em>brennivín</em> packs quite a wallop and is usually served ice-cold with <em>hákarl</em> and other fermented foods whose flavors are complemented by a swig of the peppery schnapps.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">Today, Icelanders are experimenting with local harvests to create artisanal spirits, such as rhubarb and crowberry vodkas and Gunnar’s own line of libations celebrating the birch tree, Birkir schnapps and Björk liqueur. His products are sold throughout Iceland and include a birch twig inside each bottle, to remind consumers of the spirit’s connection to one of Iceland’s most important native plants. Gunnar uses his schnapps and liqueur in his cooking in a variety of ways, including reduced and drizzled over ice cream, for caramelizing vegetables, and for adding to sauces.</p>

<div class="headnote1">Icelandic ducks flourish in the region around the goat farm of <a id="ind287a"/>Háafell, since it offers both abundant stretches of empty land and easy access to open water. Gunnar often serves the ducks fresh, but this recipe is far from fresh. Don’t let that put you off, however. The recipe is also a little daunting because it has the longest preparation time in this book—and probably longer than for any recipe in most cookbooks.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent">Once the breasts are aged, Gunnar grinds them and uses the powder as a seasoning that exceeds the flavor complexity of nearly any other seasoning. He commonly adds it to duck and vegetable dishes to finish. If you have the patience to wait the year for the breasts to cure properly, this recipe will be your secret flavoring weapon. It will also inevitably lead to questions from your dinner guests about how you made it, to which you will respond, “Have you got a year? Then let me tell you.”</div>
<div class="ingredient">
<p class="IL_item"><strong>2 wild duck breasts, boned</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>⅓ cup (5 g) birch tree leaves, finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>3 tablespoons finely chopped crowberries or blueberries</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1 tablespoon sugar</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>2½ teaspoons salt</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>2 g pink curing salt No. 1</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">Line a baking sheet with a cotton kitchen towel or other cotton cloth. Trim the duck breasts well, remove the skin, and put the breasts on the prepared baking sheet. In a small bowl, stir together the birch leaves, thyme, crowberries, sugar, salt, and curing salt, mixing well. Sprinkle the curing mix over the duck breasts, coating them evenly and completely on both sides. Cover the breasts with a second towel or cloth and refrigerate for 1 week.</div>
<div class="method">Rinse the curing mix off of the breasts under cold running water, then dry the breasts with paper towels and wrap them in a clean, dry cotton cloth. Secure the cloth with a rope, so it doesn’t unroll, and hang the “packet” for 1 year in a dark, cool space such as a cellar or basement. Once the duck breasts are dried, they can be kept in the cloth for up to 1 year.</div>
<div class="method">To use the dried breasts, grind whatever you would like to use into a powder in a spice grinder and save the rest of the breast for later use.</div>

<div class="headnote1">Berries grow in abundance on <a id="ind332a"/>Johanna Thorvaldsdóttir’s goat farm. Wild bushes flourish there, but Johanna also cultivates berries in the meticulously groomed and curated rose and vegetable garden just beyond her front door. How she has time to care for the vast array of plants is a marvel, as she seems to tend her goats nonstop from the moment she opens her eyes each morning. Johanna also incorporates the botanicals into healthful creams and lotions. A bench stands in the center of the garden, which overlooks the river just beyond her property. She sometimes says, “My dream is to one day find the time to sit down on that bench with my husband, take a deep breath, and relax.”</div>
<div class="headnote_indent">When she does find the time to relax in her garden, she will hopefully be enjoying this dessert from Gunnar. It’s an addictive combination of comforting flavors brightened by freeze-dried berries (a handy technique Gunnar uses to preserve his berries for the winter) and sweetened with honey. Each of the elements would be a star in its own right, but when combined on the plate, they prove irresistible.</div>

</div>
<div class="method">To make the praline, line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Put the sugar in a small, heavy saucepan, place over medium heat, and heat, swirling the pan, until caramelized. Stir in the nuts and toss carefully until coated with the caramel. The nuts and sugar will seize and stick together. This is not a problem, however, as the praline will be ground. Pour the hot nut mixture onto the prepared baking sheet and spread in an even layer. Let cool to room temperature. Once cooled, reserve half for the fruit and nut granola, and grind the <a id="page295"/>remaining half in a food processor to a fine powder. (You will need only 3 tablespoons of the ground praline; reserve the remainder for another use.)</div>
<div class="method">To make the caramel nut parfait, prepare an ice bath. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whip attachment, combine the egg yolks and sugar and beat on high speed until well blended and thickened. In a saucepan, combine the cream, praline, and salt over medium heat and heat gently while whisking constantly. When the mixture is steaming hot, <a id="ind298a"/>remove from the heat and pour one-third of it into the yolk mixture while whisking constantly. Slowly pour in the remaining cream mixture while continuing to whisk. Return the mixture to the saucepan, place over medium-low heat, and heat, whisking constantly, to 158°F (70°C). Strain through a fine-mesh sieve placed over a bowl, then nest the bowl in the ice bath and let stand until completely cooled.</div>
<div class="method">Spoon the cooled parfait mixture into a silicone mold with 1-inch (2.5-cm) half-spheres (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-note46">see notes</a>). Freeze until solid, about 12 hours. Just before serving, unmold the parfaits. It will be easier to unmold them if you let them stand at room temperature for five minutes beforehand.</div>
<div class="method">To make the granola, coarsely chop the reserved praline, transfer to a food processor, and pulse a few times to break it up a little more. Add the berries, coffee beans, parsnip, cinnamon, and salt and process until finely crumbled.</div>
<div class="method">To make the cake, preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whip attachment, whip the egg whites on high speed until stiff peaks form. Sift together the confectioners’ sugar, flour, and baking powder into a bowl. Fold the sifted mixture into the egg whites just until combined. Then fold in the almonds and butter just until evenly incorporated.</div>
<div class="method">Spoon the cake batter into a silicone mold with 2-inch (5-cm) half-spheres (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-note46">see notes</a>). Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until golden brown and a cake tester inserted into the center of a cake comes out clean. Let cool to room temperature on a wire rack before unmolding. Note that this batter yields more than 4 cakes.</div>
<div class="method">To make the honey foam, prepare an ice bath. Combine the water, honey, and salt in a saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat, add the gelatin, and stir until completely dissolved. Nest the pan in the ice bath and let the contents cool to room temperature. Transfer the honey mixure to a siphon and charge the siphon with 2 nitrous oxide (NO<sub class="frac">2</sub>) chargers according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Shake the siphon vigorously and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, until chilled (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-note46">see notes</a>).</div>
<div class="method">To serve, place a cake on a plate and position a parfait alongside it. Sprinkle the granola over the praline parfait, dispense some honey foam alongside the cake, and garnish with dehydrated parsley.</div>
<div class="note" id="c12-note46">
<p class="note_head"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>NOTES</strong></span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">1. Hazelnuts are much less expensive with their skins intact, and it is easy to remove the skins. Toast the nuts in a 350°F (175°C) oven for about 7 to 8 minutes, until they are fragrant and have taken on color, then wrap the still-hot nuts in a kitchen towel and rub them vigorously between your palms to remove the skins.</span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">2. Look for a wide array of freeze-dried fruits, including grapes, cherries, strawberries, and blueberries, in specialty food markets or online.</span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">3. The parfait ingredients make more parfaits than you need for serving. If your silicone mold will not hold all of the excess mixture, freeze it in ice-cube trays. The frozen parfaits are nice to have on hand whenever a sweet bite is desired.</span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">4. Once the honey foam has been charged, it must be refrigerated for at least 4 hours before dispensing or it will not hold up well. If you do not have a siphon, whisk the mixture as vigorously as possible just before serving. It will not be as light and airy as with the siphon method, but it will still be tasty.</span></p>

<div class="method">To make the pickled beets, place the beet slices in a heatproof glass jar.

<div class="headnote">Goat farmer <a id="ind334a"/>Johanna Thorvaldsdóttir is not allowed to sell her raw goat’s milk, but Gunnar dreams that one day his government will relax its strict dairy regulations and he will be able to transform her goat’s milk into the buttermilk used in this recipe. Until then, cow’s milk will have to suffice. It does double duty in this recipe, in the form of buttermilk and whey. Gunnar’s dessert recipes are rarely very sweet, and the pairing of sweet caramel with pungent horseradish and tangy buttermilk here ensures that he is staying the course. He serves the buttermilk in the form of a foam, but it is just as good drizzled in a tangy, viscous ribbon over the caramel.</div>

<div class="method">To make the buttermilk foam, combine the sugar and cream in a saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved.

<div class="method">To make the whey caramel, combine the whey and sugar in a saucepan over low heat and heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Then continue to cook until a syrupy consistency forms. It can take up to 1 hour for the syrup to form. At the end of the process, you will be left with about one-tenth of the volume that you started with. Remove from the heat and let cool for 1 minute. Line a baking sheet with a nonstick baking mat. Pour the caramel onto the mat. Once it has cooled to room temperature it will be thicker but still pourable.</div>
