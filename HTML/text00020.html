<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Visits from Aunts and Uncles</a>
</h1>
<p class="pf">I close my eyes and visualize myself during a favorite, peaceful evening in my childhood. I am tucked into bed. It is a davenport that unfolds to make a bed. It is big and heavy, with wood on the topside of the arms. It smelled like wet leather in the summertime. The bed is cozy and comfortable.</p>
<p>I was about four years old and there were three of us children at the time—Leonard, Marion, and me. There were three rooms in our farmhouse at the time, the living room, where Marion and I would sleep; a bedroom, where Mummy and Isä slept; and a narrow bed for my little brother, who had been born deaf. When Auntie Esther visited, she slept with Marion and me because we had the largest bed. We didn’t mind at all. The kitchen was big, and behind the woodstove there was a tall, black “slop pail.” That’s where us kids would go pee in the wintertime because Mummy thought it was too cold for us to run along the snowy path to the outhouse.</p>
<p>The outhouse had two holes, one that was bigger and higher and one for us kids that was smaller, on a lower shelf. Each hole had a wooden lid with a handle. We didn’t have toilet paper, so we wiped ourselves using pages torn from the previous year’s Montgomery Ward catalog. I really preferred to use pieces torn from the newspaper, but newspapers had only a few pages so the supply didn’t last long. When there was nothing left of the catalog but the shiny pages, you had to crinkle them up so the paper wouldn’t be too slippery to do the job.</p>
<p>In 1940, when I was six years old, the Rural Electric Association extended service to our area and our farm was wired for electricity. That was about the time that Isä decided to expand the house, and with the help of the hired men and our uncles, he added another bedroom and a bathroom with a “flush” toilet—which meant that the house was plumbed, with a water tank and a sewage system. A stairway from our living room was added so that we could have a bedroom in the attic. It wasn’t heated.</p>
<p>I remember one night, prior to the renovation, when my favorite aunt was visiting for the night. She was my father’s sister—pretty, slim, with dark wavy hair and with the same name as my mother. I called her “Auntie Esther.” One night I could hear the two Esthers laughing and giggling all night. They laughed and they giggled and they giggled and they laughed. Then I heard Mummy say, “Here, pee in my shoe.” Auntie Esther laughed even harder. I pretended I was fast asleep.</p>
<p>I wondered what they were laughing about. Later, I found out they had cornered a mouse.</p>
<p class="psec">Aunt Ida was the mail-order bride of Isä’s brother Edward. I could never have imagined Edward courting any woman, and besides, the “pickings” in northern Minnesota at the time were not great, so it made perfect sense that he would fill out a form and order a wife. Uncle Edward specified that she had to be Finnish, Lutheran, and a good cook and housekeeper. Ida filled the bill perfectly.</p>
<p>The thing about Ida was that she was rather “fancy,” having spent some years in New York as a cook for influential people—such as the Henry Morgenthau household (when he was secretary of the treasury) and other luminaries. She actually would come to live in Floodwood only when her employers were out of the country on vacation, usually three months or so at a time.</p>
<p>When Edward and Ida became engaged, Ida thought that Ed couldn’t afford a decent engagement ring, so she bought one herself in New York. She inspected my mother’s engagement ring and proclaimed it “Seep!” (Cheap). Mummy’s answer to this insult was, “But Ted bought it for me with his own money!”</p>
<p>Whenever Ida came home, she and Ed would make the rounds visiting all the relatives. She was full of stories. Like when we talked about how we got samples of new products in the mail. She got the sample products in little bottles that the company representative hung on the doorknob of her New York apartment. Ida was angry that people would steal her samples, such as the time someone took her sample of Listerine mouthwash. “So,” she said, “I fix them! I piss in a bottle and hung it on the doorknob. Heh, heh, they stole it!”</p>
<p>Ida was less than five feet tall, with beady eyes and a head of curly strawberry blond hair. She always carried a fat purse, wore Cuban-heeled black shoes, and talked incessantly about her sister’s girl, Barbara, whom she referred to as “Barba” rolling the <i>r</i>
’s. She would say, “Barba has tin leks!” (Barbara has thin legs) when she looked at my muscular legs.</p>
<p>Today I credit my aunt Ida for my white hair. My hair began to turn white (I hesitate to say gray!) when I was in my thirties. So, I colored my hair, but didn’t do it regularly enough, and one day when Ida and Ed were visiting, she cocked her head just like a bird and studied my hair and asked, “How come dat Peetsis hair is dat kine two tone?”</p>
<p>I vowed at that moment to go natural!</p>
<p class="psec">Aunt Ellen was a chain-smoker and would light her next cigarette from the one she was just finishing. She was the wife of my uncle Jack, who was an older brother of Isä—and Ellen was probably the reason for Edward’s decision to order a bride from New York. Ellen was a local who seemed to know all the men around. It was said that Jack was impotent, even though they had three children. There was Edwin, who was three when Jack and Ellen were married. Then there was Raymond, who bore no resemblance to the family. Mummy reported that when Ellen was pregnant, she had said in Finnish, “Well, I don’t know if the baby is Jack’s, but I know for sure it is mine!”</p>
<p>Ellen kept an immaculate house (except for the stench of cigarette smoke). She was very particular about how the “dishies” were washed, dried, and placed in the cupboard. Her electric stove was always scrubbed and looked like new. The oven sparkled. You couldn’t find a speck of dust on any of her furniture, and she carefully washed the sheets on every bed once a week. But you couldn’t breathe the air!</p>
<p>Uncle Jack was the one that we referred to as our “one-armed uncle.” I remember him when he had two arms. One day when he was on Highway 53, his car ran out of gas and he walked back to a gas station with a gas can. When he was walking back to his car with his left arm stuck out to balance the weight of the full can, a speeding car swiped him, taking off his left arm just below the elbow. They never found his hand and wrist, nor did they catch the driver. Ellen especially regretted that his wedding ring and watch were gone. Jack was fitted with a prosthetic wooden arm from the elbow down, and a pair of hooks instead of a hand. Jack continued to earn his living as a carpenter. He was lucky, he said, that he was right handed, and he could hold the nails with his left hand/hook and never hurt himself if his missed the nail with the hammer.</p>
<p>I was about five years old when I can remember the man who later became “Uncle John” visiting our home. He was courting my aunt Esther, who was staying with us for a while to help my mother after the birth of my little sister.</p>
<p>Uncle John lived in Brookston, a village about ten miles away, and I thought he was so handsome. He had a twinkle in his eye and seemed always to be smiling and always had a tall tale to tell. He would usually give me two or three shiny copper pennies. My aunt Esther taught me how to stack the pennies in the middle of a hanky and tie a knot just above them. When I went into town with Isä, I bought penny candy such as wax lips, candy buttons, Necco wafers, and root beer barrels. I usually chose those that were five for a penny so that I had enough to share with my brother and sisters at home.</p>
<p>One Saturday evening Uncle John made me a wonderful promise. He promised to take me with him on his “milk route.” He was employed by the Floodwood Creamery to drive the milk truck around the countryside to pick up milk from farmers in the area. His route went northwest along Highway 2, through the towns of Wawina, Swan River, and and then south to Jacobson.</p>
<p>Oh, I was so excited! I kept asking him about the towns I would see. He told me that Jacobson was such a big city that you had to really watch it when you crossed the street because there were so many streetcars and people.</p>
<p>“There are really tall buildings in Jacobson,” he told me. “It is really hard to find your way around in such a big city.”</p>
<p>“Should I wear my prettiest dress for the day?” I wondered out loud.</p>
<p>“Oh, yes!” he told me. “People in Jacobson are dressed really fancy!”</p>
<p>I could hardly wait. I chose my princess dress that had sections in various shades of blue. I had a pin that looked like a real pair of miniature sunglasses—about the size that would fit on a mouse. I put that pin just below my left shoulder, far enough down so that I could look at it once in a while. I put on pale-blue anklets and wore my strappy white sandals. I was sure I was dressed for the occasion.</p>
<p>Uncle John’s milk route started early in the morning—when it was still a little chilly outside, but the cab of his truck was cozy. We bumped along Highway 2, the truck grinding along as he shifted gears. Then he would turn the truck into a farmyard and back the truck up to the milk house, go into the milk house, and hoist the ten-gallon cans of milk into the back of the truck. Uncle John would climb back into the cab, start up the truck, and we’d bump along to the next farmyard. I sat eagerly on the edge of my seat watching carefully for that huge city to come into view.</p>
<p>I kept asking him about Jacobson, that big and special town that I had never heard of before. I was so excited to see this big city with all the streetcars and fancily trimmed windows. The story grew taller.</p>
<p>“Many famous people live in Jacobson,” Uncle John told me.</p>
<p>“Who?” I asked, becoming more fascinated and curious as the time went on.</p>
<p>“Oh, there are the Siermalas and the Ruzynskys and the Minkkinens!”</p>
<p>I was truly impressed and getting more eager all the time to see this wonderful metropolis.</p>
<p>“When will we get to Jacobson?” I’d ask anxiously.</p>
<p>“Oh, about eleven thirty.” We chugged along turning into one farm after another. I’d feel the bump of the milk cans as they were hoisted into the back of the truck. I’d hear the slam of the doors and the crunch of Uncle John’s footsteps as he came back to the cab to start the truck again, and off we went to yet another driveway. It seemed to take forever.</p>
<p>“Are we there yet?”</p>
<p>“Almost,” he replied. “Jacobson is just around the corner.”</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, he stopped the truck in front of a building with a sign in front that read “Jacobson, Minnesota Post Office.” Uncle John said, “Well, here we are!” We were in Jacobson.</p>
<p>I started to laugh. Uncle John had been pulling my leg and I was gullible enough not to see through all of his tall tales—that had only grown taller—about Jacobson. He did buy me a double ice-cream cone as a reward for being patient.</p>
<p>The story about Jacobson remained our favorite reminiscence for the rest of his life. Uncle John fought cancer for seven years and endeared himself to the staff at St. Luke’s Hospital in Duluth. He died on Easter Sunday morning in 1966.</p>
<p>When Uncle John died, our son, Greg, was six years old. Greg had been curious about what happens after we die and we talked about it a lot. On the way home after the funeral, Greg’s comment was, “Now Uncle John knows the big secret!”</p>

<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Orange Date-Nut Cake</a>
</p>
<p class="rpf">Drop-in company was a common occurrence in the summertime. Plus, summertime was when we seemed to have a lot of family traffic, hired men, and neighbors around. We felt we could never be caught without some kind of <i>kahvileipä,</i>
 that is, something to go with coffee.</p>
<p class="rp">This is the perfect cake for any occasion and it keeps well—that is, if it isn’t all eaten up right away! It’s moist and delicious because it’s doused with orange juice syrup just after it is removed from the oven. We usually baked this cake in a 9- by 13-inch rectangular pan, but once in a while, we’d bake it in a fluted tube pan or a Bundt pan.</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpilf">1½ cups sugar, divided</p>
<p class="rpil">¾ cup (1½ sticks) butter, at room temperature</p>
<p class="rpil">2 large eggs</p>
<p class="rpil">2 teaspoons freshly grated orange zest</p>
<p class="rpil">2½ cups all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="rpil">1 teaspoon baking powder</p>
<p class="rpil">1 teaspoon baking soda</p>
<p class="rpil">1 cup chopped pitted dates</p>
<p class="rpil">1 cup chopped walnuts</p>
<p class="rpil">1 cup buttermilk</p>
<p class="rpill">1 cup fresh orange juice</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">Preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter a 9- by 13-inch baking pan or a 10-inch fluted tube pan.</p>
<p class="rp">In a large mixing bowl, cream ¾ cup of the sugar and the butter together until smooth. Add the eggs and beat until light. Stir in the orange zest. In another bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Put the dates and walnuts into yet another small bowl and mix with 1 tablespoon of the flour mixture. Add the flour mixture and buttermilk alternately to the creamed mixture and beat until the batter is light. Fold in the dates and nuts. Turn the batter into the prepared pan.</p>
<p class="rp">Bake for 35 to 40 minutes for the 9- by 13-inch cake, or 55 to 60 minutes for the tube pan, or until a wooden skewer comes out clean. (We used to take a piece of straw from a corn broom to use as a tester.)</p>
<p class="rp">Meanwhile, combine the orange juice and remaining sugar in a small saucepan. Heat to simmering and pour over the hot cake as soon as you take it out of the oven.</p>
<p class="rp">Cool the cake in the pan on a wire rack. Invert the tube cake onto a serving plate or cut squares from the 9- by 13-inch cake.</p>
<p class="rpy">Makes about 16 servings</p>
