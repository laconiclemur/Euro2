<p class="summary1">Cremat <span class="italic">is a festive drink that was brought back from Cuba by returning sailors in the nineteenth century. It is served during</span> habaneras, <span class="italic">concerts of songs that have roots in Cuba. The songs are romantic and nostalgic, about lost loves, faraway lands, and sailing ships with cargoes of rum. Once they were sung by fishermen in taverns; now the concerts are held on the beaches of the Costa Brava. At such events, the</span> cremat <span class="italic">has a higher proportion of rum than coffee and is served flaming (</span>cremat <span class="italic">means “burnt”) in earthenware</span> cazuelas. <span class="italic">For us in our city kitchens and dining rooms,</span> cremat <span class="italic">made with a greater proportion of coffee makes for a sumptuous and spectacular after-dinner drink. You can burn off all of the alcohol content or as little as you like—by dousing the rum sooner, before the flames die down, with the hot coffee, or by covering it with a lid (be careful not to spill it and start a fire). You can make this with brandy instead of rum.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">2 cups rum</p>
<p class="qun">2 to 3 tablespoons sugar</p>
<p class="qun">2 cinnamon sticks</p>
<p class="qun">Peel of 1 lemon, removed in 4 large strips</p>
<p class="qun1">4 cups freshly made hot strong coffee</p>
<p class="recsum">Put the rum, sugar, cinnamon sticks, and lemon peel in a <span class="italic">cazuela,</span> shallow casserole, or skillet (I use a fondue dish), and stir over low heat to dissolve the sugar. Ignite the rum with a long match, being careful, as long blue flames will flare up. Let the flames almost die down, for a minute or so, then pour in the coffee—it will put them out. Ladle into cups to serve.</p>
