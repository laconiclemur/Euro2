What a treat! As a teen, I spent many summers in Paris and have continued my love affair with the city over twenty years later. I read all day AND night and finished the book this morning. While i really enjoyed the story of how the women's lives changed, the author had me the minute she described the location. How I wish I could live in such an amazing house, on that street deep in the heart of Paris. This book makes me long to go back in time for next year's Fete de la Musique."</p><p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7">Beatrice, Amazon review</em></p><p class="calibre6">“I loved how the author allowed me to feel and be part of the chaos. I loved how with each page, I was able to see clearer into the story told. It was simple, whimsical, and naked in the way raw emotion sometimes is. I "felt" a lot reading this book. This book said to me that all hell breaks loose for a reason and when that reason is unveiled, it's worth the trouble.”</p><p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7">LivFst, Amazon review</em></p><p class="calibre6">“This is one of the best books I've read in quite awhile! The location is so authentic and if you close your eyes you really feel like you are on the streets of Paris! The author's characters are so realistic that I actually felt like I knew these people. Obviously the author's knowledge of Paris comes from personal experience not just research. This is definitely a "feel good" story! I eagerly await another novel from this author.”</p><p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7">book crazy, Amazon review</em></p><p class="calibre6">“I finished this book last night and found it really a great read. Was transported back to Paris and the characters in the book were so enjoyable. When I finished I wanted to read more about everyone -could have just kept going.</p><p class="calibre6">A really great first novel.”</p><p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7">Jayell, Amazon review</em></p><p class="calibre6">“...I made a prediction that I wasn't going to like it. What a stupid thing to do. It took me awhile to read the first 30 pages or so and then I was hooked. I couldn't put it down, I took it everywhere with me, much to my children's dismay.</p><p class="calibre6">The characters were delightful, bad, good and in-between. I wanted to hate Mark, but the way he was portrayed I just knew he wasn't all bad and there was hope for him yet. I also wanted to label Lucas as a womanizing French snob but again, the way Ms. Gantz described him, I knew there was more to him than met the eye. Jared was a mystery and a surprise altogether. Althea's situation was heartbreaking, I wanted find her mother and punch her in the nose. Lola and Annie were fun and reminded me of some of my friends from my single days. When you have a talented writer like Ms. Gantz to develop and put all these characters together with such a clever storyline you have one hell of a novel.</p><p class="calibre6">The storyline kept me interested, it was not at all predictable and as I said before I couldn't put it down once I got started. Ms. Gantz has the ability to make you fall in love with a location and its inhabitants to the point that you wish they were real so you could make a visit!”</p><p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7">Tracie, goodreads review</em></p><p class="calibre6">I have fallen in love with a house, three women, two men and five children. I have fallen in love with this book. The author brings her characters to life and you find yourself not only liking them but rooting for them. You want the happy ending. You meet Annie, the mother of three young boys, whose husband died three years ago. She uses her home and food as permanent occupations for the time her sons are in school. She renovates the house and cooks wonderful meals to fill her days but now money is running out and she needs to think what to do. Filled with her own insecurities, she now fills her home with roomers with insecurities. Lola, the former model turned mother of two, escapes from her husband and perfect California life. She arrives in Paris with her children and finds a hiding place in Annie's home. Althea flees a loneliness that has trapped her and taken hold of her life. Jared has his own demons to escape. Then there is Lucas, Jared's godfather and Annie's best friend. You will come to know these people and will at times like and dislike them and the decisions they make but they will keep you interested.</p><p class="calibre6">I laughed out loud and even shed a tear. There is no perfect happy ever after in life but this book leaves you hoping there could be.</p><p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7">Karen M. Amazon review</em></p><p class="calibre6">“...I loved this book! I know you're not supposed to judge a book by its cover, but with this one, you should do just that! The beautiful picture on the front opens up to a wonderfully rich, beautiful and inspiring slice of life, set in Paris, which makes it even better! You'll fall in love with each of the characters in this book, they are all very human, with problems we can all relate to in some way. This is a story of old hurts, new beginnings, friendships and love, and fresh hope for the future. I recommend this book very highly!”</p><p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7">Cathy, goodreads review</em></p><p class="calibre6">“I loved Hidden in Paris! Ms. Gantz has created a story that should be read and savored - much like the Parisian lifestyle she depicts. The characters were deep and immensely likable and the plot line was smooth and delicious. They say every writer has one great novel inside them somewhere. Well, I dearly hope Ms. Gantz has another one to follow up this masterpiece! The undertones of love and motherhood, self-loathing and hidden anger are so palpable that it's bound to keep readers up way past their bedtimes. Truly, truly, truly an excellent novel that leaves its reader pondering the characters' lives and choices long after the last page. I'd recommend this book to anyone and everyone!”</p><p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7">Megan, Amazon review</em></p><p class="calibre6">“This book makes me want to go back to France! The food! The unique people! I love the characters in Corine Gantz's book, they aren't perfect or one dimensional. Each one has their struggles but they come out on top. I love the romance between Annie and Lucas. Beautiful book cover!”</p><p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7">Susan, goodreads review</em></p><p class="calibre6">“...Everything I have been missing about Paris is in it (the good things about the French as well as the annoying ones!). I got attached to the characters right away, I like that they were multi dimensional (how boring when everyone is either wonderful or evil with no in between). It made me want to move into that beautiful house and be nurtured by Annie and fed her amazing cooking. This book makes you travel to France without having to buy a plane ticket.”</p><p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7">Isabelle, goodreads review</em></p><p class="ctx">“...What's more precious than several hours of private reading pleasure? Especially if you're lucky enough to have a book that draws you into the characters the way "Hidden in Paris" does. Reading the book I saw a little piece of myself in every female character and they reminded me of my own circle of wildly disparate friends, too. These characters come off as real people with real problems but they all have a great deal of heart..”</p><p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7">Fengshui by Fishgirl, goodreads review</em></p><p class="calibre6">“I was attracted to this author's blog by looking at interior design/style websites. I visit frequently and was thrilled that her book was complete and downloaded the Kindle version instantly. True to form, the yarn is spun smoothly and stylishly, with humor. While getting to know the characters, you get to visit France and taste the food! –Each event, conflict and individual that enters and leaves in a life, are significant pieces of a unique mosaic. This was beautifully demonstrated in this lovely story.”</p><p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7">Julie, Amazon review</em></p><p class="calibre6">Reading some of the reviews, I was mystified. Researching the critics, I found all but one liked very little they had purchased. Sounds more like home buyer's remorse addiction than an honest critique of "Hidden in Paris" (or anything else they purchased). The other is a young, self-proclaimed critic with a web site. No criticism on my part as everyone needs a niche. I just like to see who is critiquing. Myself, I have no credentials, but loved the book. I bought it on my Kindle ... by accident, hitting the wrong title. I wish all my mistakes turned out this well. The creativity, fluidity, humor and unique writing style make this a first-rate read. The characters are live and real, pulling few punches. You may not like this if you are dealing with some of the real character issues or have a history you are trying to forget. For myself, I found the "realness" of characters added a welcome balance to many other books I have read where the characters' problems lag with superficiality. This being said, I found most of the characters fun and intriguing. This leaves me with a question: When is Corine Gantz publishing her next? "Hidden in Paris" is a very good first novel.</p><p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7">Oubliable “Tim,” Amazon review</em></p><p class="calibre6">I truly enjoyed this book and all it's quirky characters. Yes, things turn out the way you want them to and expect them to, but is that such a bad deal? I didn't realize it was self-published until the very end which makes me like it even more and gain much respect for the author for following her own dream. It would make a wonderful movie.</p><p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7">Betsy, Amazon review</em></p><p class="calibre6">I really enjoyed this book. I have never been to Paris and now I feel like I have. Before purchasing this book, I read all the reviews and even though a couple people didn't enjoy it, I figured it must not be there type of genre. The fact that the characters have personal issues they are dealing with makes the story even more intriguing. I cannot wait until Mrs. Gantz writes another book.</p><p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7">Serenity 17, Amazon review</em></p><p class="calibre6">I purchased this book on a whim because my husband and I were going to Paris in August, and I am really glad I did. I loved the characters, I loved the insight into the personalities of Parisians, and I really loved the descriptions of Annie's food! I think there should be a follow-up cookbook...</p><p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7">M. Napoli, Amazon review</em></p></div></body></html>
