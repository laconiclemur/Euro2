  <p class="h3">Lamb (Lam)</p>

  <p class="noindent">Lamb has a mild and yet singular flavor. The meat has fine fibrous structure and is tender and juicy.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Frozen lamb:</span> Like all meat, it should be defrosted in the refrigerator or in a very cold room. Quick defrosting in a warm room causes the meat juices to seep out, leaving the meat less flavorful and juicy.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Cooking:</span> Never boil meat hard but let it simmer. Use this procedure: Bring water to a boil, add meat, and return to a boil. Skim well, and add ingredients recipe calls for. Let the meat simmer until tender. The length of time depends on the thickness of the meat.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Frying:</span> Dry the meat pieces well with a paper towel. Add butter to the frying pan, let it melt, foam-up, and turn a nut brown. Be careful not to burn. When foam subsides add the meat. Add one serving portion at a time into the pan. Add salt and spices after the meat is browned. Let pan cook a minute or two after meat is removed and before adding additional pieces. This will assure an even, hot surface in the pan. Pour the strained meat juice over the meat in a kettle and simmer until done.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Roasted:</span> You will get the best result when it bakes at 265°F (130°C). Always use a meat thermometer. Insert into the thickest part of the lean meat, and do not let it touch fat or bone. The cooking period depends on weight and thickness of the meat and how you like it baked. Lamb ribs are baked at a higher temperature, 350°F (175°C), to secure golden brown and crisp ribs.</p>

  <p class="h3">Ribs of Lamb with a Touch of Birch (Pinnekjøtt)</p>

  <p class="cap1"><span class="italic">The western area has given Norwegian food culture a delicious dish that is reserved, in most cases, for Christmas. Some vestlendinger insist that the anticipation is even better than the taste, if that is possible.</span></p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/56-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent">Most Scandinavian delicatessens will be able to supply you with <span class="italic">pinnekjøtt.</span> Cooking directions are the same as for your home-cured ribs. Figure on 10–12 ounces (285–340 g.) of <span class="italic">pinnekjøtt</span> per person. It is not by chance that Christmas and <span class="italic">pinnekjøtt</span> are so closely associated. They belong together! The sheep that have been getting fat from their summer-time grazing on the mountain farms are slaughtered in September and October, and it is from these animals the ribs are taken.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">4 ½ lbs. (2 kg.) cured lamb ribs-pinnekjøtt</p>

  <p class="ingl">Boiling water</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Cooking:</span> Soak ribs overnight in lots of water. Cooking the lamb rib to perfection is part of the preparation. Use a large kettle with very little water in the bottom. Position an interlaced “bridge” of small birch branches (with bark removed) just over the water in the kettle (or use a rack). A dexterous person will have no problem building a firm “bridge” so the meat will not receive an involuntary dunking!</p>

  <p class="indent">Distribute the meat evenly on this structure, cover tightly, and put a weight on top. Place over moderate heat and cook for approximately 2 hours. More water may be added as necessary. Do not remove the meat until tender or until it is ready to be served.</p>

  <p class="indent">Boiled/steamed potatoes are usually served with <span class="italic">pin</span><span class="italic">nekjøtt</span>, and mashed rutabagas with the addition of a generous amount of butter and some cream makes this a royal feast. Let each guest season with pepper to taste. A large serving platter is ideal for both the rutabagas and <span class="italic">pinnekjøtt</span>. Mound the mashed rutabagas in the center of the platter. Arrange the ribs so that the cutlet end borders the platter and the ribs point upwards, encircling the heaped rutabagas. What a magnificent sight! A choice lamb rib is fat enough that no additional sauce is needed, but if so desired, the <a id="page_57"/>cooking broth may be served on the side. And yes, using both hands to eat <span class="italic">pinnekjøtt</span> is quite acceptable.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Dry-salting:</span> Rub the lamb ribs well with salt to which has been added a large pinch of saltpeter, giving the meat a red, more delicate appearance. (Saltpeter is optional.) Put a generous layer of salt, mixed with a little saltpeter, in the bottom of the salt tub. Lay the ribs on top with the bone side up and cover with another blanket of salt. The salt will draw the blood out from the meat and create brine that is used for basting the meat from time to time. Some Norwegian cookbooks recommend the mutton remain in this salt for 2 days, but 36 hours is sufficient. Dry the mutton rib well and it is ready for hanging. Many maintain 3 to 4 days’ drying time is enough, but <span class="italic">pinnekjøtt</span> experts insist on a much longer time—from butchering season until Christmas, or not less than 2 ½ months. It is important that the drying process gets off to a good start, so the use of an electric fan for the first 3 or 4 days is recommended. Hang in the airiest, driest, and darkest place possible. When finished drying, remove the rib with the cutlet attached. It is necessary to soak the cutlet in water for a couple of hours after such a long hanging period.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="red">Classic Leg of Lamb (Klassisk lammestek)</span></p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">5 lbs. (2 ½ kg.) leg of lamb, app.</p>

  <p class="ing">3 garlic cloves</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tsp. salt</p>

  <p class="ing">1 onion, quartered</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tsp. pepper</p>

  <p class="ing">3 carrots, cut in two</p>

  <p class="ing">4 stems rosemary, or 1 ½ tsp. dried</p>

  <p class="ingl">1 qt. (1 l.) app. Water</p>

  <p class="noindent">Rub the lamb well with salt and pepper. Slice the garlic and cut small pockets in the meat and stick the garlic pieces and rosemary tufts in the pockets. Peel the vegetables and place them in a greased ovenproof baking pan, add the leg of lamb. Insert a meat thermometer in the thickest part but be careful not to touch the bone. Pour one quart water in the pan. Roast at 225ºF (125ºC) for 2–3 hours. When the thermometer shows 160ºF (70ºC), the roast is rare; when it shows 165ºF (76ºC), it is done. Pack the roast in foil and let it rest at least 15 minutes before carving. In the meantime, make the gravy.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/57-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h3">Gravy:</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">3 ¾ cups (8 dl) pan juices or broth</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tsp. soy sauce</p>

  <p class="ing">4 tbsp. flour</p>

  <p class="ing">½ tsp. pepper</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tbsp. black currant juice or red wine</p>

  <p class="ingl">½ tsp. salt</p>

  <p class="noindent">Boil the pan juices. In a thin stream add the thickened flour, which has been stirred into a little water, while stirring continually. Let it simmer 10 minutes. Add soy sauce, black currant juice/red wine, salt, and pepper to taste. Serve with boiled potatoes, peas, carrots, and mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="red">Lamb and Cabbage (F</span><span class="red">å</span><span class="red">rik</span><span class="red">å</span><span class="red">l)</span></p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="italic">Norway’s national dish! Dr. Thor Heyerdahl, world-renowned Norwegian ethnologist, author, and explorer of Kon-Tiki and RA II fame, shared his favorite version of this recipe with us.</span></p>

  <p class="noindent1">A welcome sign of fall in my youth was a pot of <span class="italic">fårikål</span> simmering on our black wood stove. The cherished sunlit summer evenings, replaced by the pitch black September nights, was a perfect setting <a id="page_58"/>for this dish. The whole pepper corns hidden in between cabbage leaves and under chunks of meat is part of the “tradition,” but if you want to avoid the “nuisance” enclose them. I usually double the peppercorns recipes call for.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">6 lbs. (2 ¾ kg.) lamb breast or shoulder</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tbsp. salt</p>

  <p class="ing">2 large heads cabbage</p>

  <p class="ing">4 tbsp. flour</p>

  <p class="ingl">1 tbsp. black pepper corns</p>

  <p class="noindent5">Wash the lamb in lukewarm water and cut into small pieces. Blot dry, dip in flour, and layer in the pot with a little more than half the cabbage that has been washed and coarsely cut. Add boiling water until it reaches half the level of the meat. Add salt and pepper. Simmer for 1 hour, then add reminder of the cabbage. Simmer well covered for about 1 hour longer, or until meat and cabbage are tender. Serve with steamed/boiled potatoes, carrots and flatbread.</p>

  <p class="noindent1">Serves 10–12</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/58-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h3">Fricassee of Lamb (Lammefrikassé)</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">2 lbs. (900 g.) of lamb w/bone neck, shoulder, ribs,</p>

  <p class="ing">or shanks</p>

  <p class="ing">1 parsnip</p>

  <p class="ing">1 head cauliflower</p>

  <p class="ing">1 leek</p>

  <p class="ing">2 ½ cups (6 ¼ dl) water</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ½ tsp. salt</p>

  <p class="ingl">2–3 carrots</p>

  <p class="noindent">Bring water to a boil and add the meat. Return to a boil and reduce heat and simmer about 45 minutes. Clean, peel, and slice vegetables. Add to the meat the last 10 minutes. Season. Serve with rice or steamed/boiled potatoes.</p>

  <p class="noindent1">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="h3">Lungemos from Telemark (Lungemos fra Telemark)</p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="italic">This recipe, using veal and lamb, is somewhat different from the original recipe, yet very tasty. Lungemos means finely chopped lungs or intestines cooked in stock.</span></p>

  <p class="noindent1">After several years absence from Norway, I rather embarrassed my aunt Esther on my first return trip there. She had waited to do the final grocery shopping until I arrived, thinking I would enjoy choosing our meal. I was delighted and knew exactly what I wanted. The last few days before leaving for Norway, <span class="italic">lungemos</span> had come to mind, and that is what I desired. When I spotted it in the store, I excitedly exclaimed, “Lomos!” In my broken slang, that was like using “ain’t” for “am not.” “Ssh! It is called <span class="italic">lungemos</span>! Besides it is not fit to serve guests from America,” my aunt explained, obviously embarrassed.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Well, when we topped off our <span class="italic">lungemos</span> dinner with an elegant marzipan cake, she felt somewhat better. As for me I was very happy. And my aunt—she never let me forget that bizarre meal.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">1 lb. (450 g.) veal or lamb</p>

  <p class="ing">½ tsp. pepper</p>

  <p class="ing">1 cup (2 ½ dl) stock</p>

  <p class="ing">½ tsp. ginger</p>

  <p class="ing">1 onion, small</p>

  <p class="ing">Salt</p>

  <p class="ingl">1 tbsp. butter</p>

  <p class="noindent">Grind or mince the meat. Add meat, stock, onion, and butter into a saucepan. Simmer about 30 minutes. Add spices and salt. If needed add a little barley flour to thicken to the consistency of porridge. Delicious served with flatbread, potatoes and lingonberries.</p>

  <p class="noindent1">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_59"/>Potato Dumplings with Meat (Kumler med kjøtt)</p>

  <p class="cap1"><span class="italic">Kumle recipes and traditions vary from place to place and home to home. This is Ingrid Espelid Hovig’s Norwegian culinary expert and television chef’s recipe as used in her home in Bergen.</span></p>

  <p class="noindent1">Some cooks put meat or salt pork in the dumplings; others serve the meat on the side. Some serve potato dumplings with a sauce made from Norwegian goat cheese, <span class="italic">geitost</span>, while others pour melted butter over their dumplings.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ½ lbs. (675 g.) salted and smoked mutton</p>

  <p class="ing">1 lb. (450 g.) salt pork, approx.</p>

  <p class="ingl">3 quarts (3 liters) water</p>

  <p class="noindent">Soak the meat and salt pork overnight. Bring to a boil, uncovered, in fresh cold water. Skim. Simmer meat and salt pork, covered, until tender, about 1–2 hours. Remove from pan and keep warm in a little of the stock.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="blue">Potato Dumplings:</span></p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/59-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">1 lb. (450 g.) raw potatoes, peeled 2–3 tbsp. flour</p>

  <p class="ing">¼ lb. (115 g.) boiled potatoes 1 rutabaga, small</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tsp. salt Melted butter</p>

  <p class="ingl">¾–1 cup (1 ¾–2 ½ dl) barley flour Thyme</p>

  <p class="noindent">Grate the raw potatoes on the finest part of the grater or grind them in a food mill with the finest attachment. Mash or grind the boiled potatoes and mix the two. Add salt and flour at once to prevent potatoes from darkening. If the potatoes have a high water content you should pour off some of the water before the flour is added or you will have to add more flour and then the dumplings will be too firm. The amount of flour needed depends on the quality of the potatoes. Make a small dumpling to test this. The mixture should not be so thin that the dumplings spread out into the stock, nor should they be so firm that they are heavy and tough.</p>

  <p class="indent">Shape the dumplings with a tablespoon dipped in warm stock and drop them into the simmering stock. The meat stock should simmer at all times while the dumplings are cooking. The kettle should be so large that there is plenty of room for the dumplings or they may stick together. Simmer for about 30 minutes or until they are cooked through. To test cut a dumpling in two.</p>

  <p class="indent">Peel the rutabaga and cut into bite-size pieces. Boil tender in a little of the meat stock or in lightly-salted water. If there is room in the kettle, the rutabagas may be cooked with the dumplings.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cut the salt pork in slices and the meat in cubes. Place meat, pork, and rutabagas on a platter with the dumplings. Serve, using the melted fat skimmed from the stock, or a little margarine as a sauce. The next day season the stock with salt and thyme to taste, and serve as a soup with the dumplings or alone.</p>

  <p class="noindent1">Makes 4–6 servings</p>

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_60"/>Potato Dumplings with Bacon and Lingonberries (Kumler med flesk og tyttebær)</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/60-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ½ lbs. (600 g.) potatoes, raw and peeled</p>

  <p class="ing">½ cup (100 g.) bacon, diced</p>

  <p class="ing">½ lb. (200 g.) potatoes, boiled and peeled</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tbsp. butter</p>

  <p class="ing">Salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="ing">Meat stock or water, warm</p>

  <p class="ing">⅞ cup (2 dl) barley flour</p>

  <p class="ing">1 cup (2 dl) lingonberries</p>

  <p class="ing">1 onion, diced</p>

  <p class="ingl">2 tbsp. sugar</p>

  <p class="noindent">Grate the raw potatoes on the finest part of the grater. Mash and grind the boiled potatoes and mix the two. Add salt and four at once to prevent the potatoes from darkening. If the potatoes have a high water content pour off some of the water before the flour is added or you will have to add more flour and then the dumplings will be too firm. The amount of flour needed depends on the quality of the potatoes. Make a small dumpling to test this. The mixture should not be so thin that the dumplings spread out in the stock, nor should they be so firm that they are heavy and tough. Fry the bacon and onion and add salt and pepper. Drain. Shape the dumplings with a tablespoon dipped in warm stock and fill them with the bacon mixture and drop them into the simmering stock. The meat stock should simmer at all times while the dumplings are cooking. The kettle should be large enough so that there is plenty of room for the dumplings or they may stick together. Let the dumplings simmer for about 25 minutes. Serve with sugar and stirred lingonberries. Usual side dishes are <span class="italic">vossakorv</span>, salted lamb, and mashed rutabagas.</p>

  <p class="h3">Cured Meat (Spekemat)</p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="italic">Salt-cured meat has been a traditional part of Norwegian gastronomy since Viking days. In olden times it was necessary to build stocks of dried food as insurance against the uncertainties of the future.</span></p>

  <p class="noindent1">Before salt was used, meat was probably heat-smoked at home in the open-hearth living room and then hung in the larder for further drying and maturing.</p>

  <p class="indent">The arrival of salt on the household scene meant a change in the method of curing, from salting to drying (maturing) and often smoking. And many were the handsome storehouses (<span class="italic">stabbur</span>) in rural districts, all well filled with years-old hams, legs of lamb, and sausages.</p>

  <p class="indent">Today, the production of salt-cured food in Norway is a skilled process carried out in modern slaughterhouses under constant government supervision. And salt-cured food is more popular than ever: it provides renewed contact with the simple, romantic ways of the past and, of course, it tastes so good!</p>

  <p class="indent">The roots of this tradition-rich food grows deep in Norwegian food culture. The taste is novel and exciting with innumerable possibilities for variation. Exciting entrees may be prepared in moments, and it tastes delicious all year round. It is also suitable around the clock, on a piece of bread in the morning, in a salad for lunch, in a picnic basket, or together with dill-stewed potatoes for dinner. For parties or evening snack, or on a buffet, cured meat is welcome. Always keep some type of cured meat on hand, as you can always count on somebody dropping in, right?</p>

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_61"/>Cured Meat Buffet (Spekematbuffet)</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/61-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent">The serving of Norwegian salt-cured meat abounds with attractive possibilities. The salt-cured buffet, with its numerous variations and combinations, is easy to prepare because most of the dishes can be placed ready on the table before the guests arrive. Suitable all year around this genuine Viking food invariably attracts a great deal of well-deserved attention.</p>

  <p class="indent">Scrambled eggs and salt-cured meats go together naturally in the Norwegian diet. The scrambled eggs may, if desired, be served cold. Beat together 4 eggs, 3 tbsp. cream, ¼ teaspoon salt, and 1 tablespoon chopped chives. Pour into medium-hot frying pan containing 1 ½ tablespoons melted butter. Gently heat the mixture until it begins to coagulate, stirring with a fork.</p>

  <p class="indent">Sour cream and Norwegian flatbread make an excellent accompaniment to this type of food—as do fresh-fried chipped potatoes and mushrooms fried in butter.</p>

  <p class="indent">Omelettes, either plain or vegetable filled—asparagus, cauliflower, celery, or leek—are particular favorites.</p>

  <p class="indent">Baked tomatoes with butter and Norwegian flatbread add a novel touch.</p>

  <p class="indent">Potato salad with sour cream is very easy to make. First prepare some boiled potatoes. Mix ¾ tablespoon of French-type mustard sauce and 1 cup (2 ½ dl) sour cream. Pour this over the sliced potatoes and sprinkle liberally with chopped chives.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Slicing cured meat:</span> Slice the meat on a chopping board using a sharp knife. Start slicing from the thickest muscle near the shank and then cut slices across the muscle fibers so that the meat will be tender. White bread or Norwegian flatbread and butter should accompany the dish. In Norway sour cream is a favorite accompaniment.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Preserving cured meat:</span> Meat being hung to dry should be placed in a bag of porous material such as cheesecloth (not plastic), which should not come in contact with the meat. A stiff wire frame around the meat can prevent this. The top opening of casing should be tightly closed at all times. The cured meat may be cut into smaller portions and frozen.</p>

  <p class="h3">Salt-Cured Ham (Spekeskinke)</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/61-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent">The ideal weight for a good salt-cured ham is 8 ½–11 lbs. (4–5 kg.). In the preparation of salt-cured ham the same method is used as for salt-cured leg of lamb, but because the ham is larger more salt and a longer curing period is required. The ham may be either brine-cured or dry-salted. Prepare brine, thoroughly clean a suitable container, and chill both. Rub the ham well with salt using approximately ¼ cup (½ dl) to each 2 ¼ lbs. (1 kg.) of meat (the addition of ½ tablespoon sugar is optional). Place a generous layer of salt mixture beneath the meat as well as between the layers and carefully pour the brine into the container to completely cover.</p>

  <p class="indent">Pour <span class="italic">carefully</span> to avoid washing away the rubbed-in salt. If a large quantity of meat is being cured and is therefore tightly packed, it leaves less room for the brine, so be sure to salt extra well. Place a weight on the meat so that it will be completely submerged at all times. Salted meat must be carefully observed. If a grey scum appears on the surface, remove and add more salt, bring to a boil, and skim well. It is not advisable to make fresh brine as this will remove additional meat juices and affect the flavor of the meat. Whether the dry-salt or brine-cured method is employed, the meat should cure <a id="page_62"/>for 6 to 10 weeks before being hung to dry. Remove ham from the brine, rinse well in cold water, and hang to dry in a well ventilated, comparatively dry and not too warm area. The ham may also be smoked. If so, first soak in cold water for 24 hours to remove excess salt. It should be thoroughly dried before being smoked. It takes from 4 to 5 months for the ham to be cured and ready to eat.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/62-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h3">Winter Brine (Vinterlake)</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">10 quarts (10 liters) water</p>

  <p class="ing">3 lbs. (1 kg. 350 g.) salt (not iodized)</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ½ lbs. (675 g.) sugar</p>

  <p class="h3">Summer Brine (Sommerlake)</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">10 quarts (10 liters) water</p>

  <p class="ing">4 ½ lbs. (2 kg.) salt (not iodized)</p>

  <p class="ingl">1 ½–2 ½ cups (3 ¾–5 ¾ dl) sugar</p>

  <p class="noindent">A stronger brine is required if meat takes place during summer weather or in a warm, humid room. The brine can be made from either coarse or regular salt. Combine all ingredients and bring to a boil. Do not use aluminum pans. Stir occasionally as the brine scorches easily. Skim well and boil from 5–10 minutes. Cool <span class="italic">completely</span> before pouring over the meat. Discard sediment but include any salt that may have settled on the bottom. Sugar has a tenderizing effect and gives added flavor.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="red">Cured Leg of Lamb (Fenal</span><span class="red">å</span><span class="red">r)</span></p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="italic">Fenalår is another Norwegian delicacy that emanates from a period when our people struggled to preserve enough food to last through the long winters. Surely our forefathers would be amazed that what to them was a necessity would in future generations become a favorite in Norwegian culinary culture.</span></p>

  <p class="noindent1">In ages past most slaughtering took place in November. In the old Norwegian language the month of November was known as <span class="italic">gormanadr</span> (the month for butchering). It was an especially busy and taxing month as they needed to butcher a sufficient number of animals to meet their meat and bacon needs for the year. The meat was either dried, salted, or smoked, or a combination of all three. It was quite a status symbol to have your <span class="italic">stabbur</span> (storehouse built on pillars) filled with food, and not at all unusual to find a cured ham or leg of lamb, which had hung there for 5 or 6 years and often much longer. Experts agree, however, that for meat to be at its tastiest best it should not hang longer than 1 to 2 years.</p>

  <p class="indent">The preparation of salted and cured meat, <span class="italic">spekemat</span>, requires dry air; the drier the air the better the meat. The size of the leg of lamb is also important. Small ones have a tendency to dry out while the larger ones remain juicy and flavorful. The fresher the meat the better the end result. Dry-salting is the best method for curing a leg of lamb, however; if more than one is being cured, use the brine method.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Dry-salting:</span> Dry-salting extracts the juice from the meat and produces strong brine with which meat should be basted often and evenly. Vigorously rub the salt into the meat. In a wooden tub, crock, glass, or enamel container put a generous layer of salt to cover the bottom. Place the meat on top of the salt with the bone side up. Sprinkle the top with a blanket of salt. If sugar is used add ½ cup sugar (1 ¼ dl) to 2 lbs. (900 g.) of salt.</p>

  <p class="h3">New Year’s Eve Game (Viltgryte)</p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="italic">The first time I tasted this dish was in “Sami country” in Northern Norway. I thought maybe it tasted so good because I was in “Sami surroundings,” but I have never been disappointed with later servings.</span></p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/62-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent">This dish tastes good all year long, not only on New Year’s Eve. It is the best known Sami dish in Norway. Accompaniments are boiled potatoes and stirred lingonberries. It calls for reindeer meat but any game will do.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">1 lb. (450 g.) half frozen reindeer</p>

  <p class="ing">shoulder thinly sliced</p>

  <p class="ing">½ cup (1 ¼ dl) milk, scant</p>

  <p class="ing">¼ cup (½ dl) sour cream</p>

  <p class="ing">Butter for browning</p>

  <p class="ing">3 thin slices Norwegian goat cheese</p>

  <p class="ing"><a id="page_63"/>½ cup (1 ¼ dl) mushrooms</p>

  <p class="ing">5 juniper berries, crushed</p>

  <p class="ing">1 cup (2 ½ dl) water, scant</p>

  <p class="ing">Salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="ingl">1 ½ tbsp. flour</p>

  <p class="noindent">Shave thin pieces off the half defrosted meat. Brown quickly in butter in a hot pan. Clean and slice the mushrooms and fry in a separate pan, and add to meat. Stir in flour mixed with a little water. Bring to a boil, then reduce and let simmer 10 minutes. Stir milk into the sour cream and add to the kettle with goat cheese and juniper berries. Season with salt and pepper.</p>

  <p class="cap1"><span class="italic">A few simple rules and your sausages will be delicious every time. And why not make your own? It is neither difficult nor time consuming.</span></p>

  <p class="noindent1">Many meat grinders and kitchen machines have optional sausage attachments. It is satisfying to know one can enjoy sausage without so many preservatives, that one feels embalmed before the meal is through.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">To Cook:</span> Never boil sausages; they should only simmer. Bring the water to a boil and turn the heat down before you add sausages. With a cooking thermometer it is easy to control the temperature of the water. Around 180°F (82°C) is the right temperature for all sausages. Simmer thin Wieners, hot dogs, and other small sausages about 10 minutes. Knockwurst, bratwurst, and the like should simmer about 15 minutes, and large dinner sausages, pork sausages, and the like about 20 minutes. Use this time for raw, cooked, or smoked <a id="page_65"/>sausage. If you need to use the sausages direct from the freezer add another half time to it. If desired, for added flavor, simmer the sausages in bouillon, and add a few slices of onion or your favorite spices.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">To fry:</span> Fry over medium-high heat in very little fat, and remove sausages as soon as they are browned.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="bold">To grill:</span> When grilling outside or in the oven, make two to three slits on each of the sausages or hot dogs, or punch small holes in them. It will keep them from splitting open. Remember to turn often; sausages soon scorch on a hot grill.</p>

  <p class="h3">Pork Sausage or Patties (Medisterpølser/kaker)</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">2 lbs. (900 g.) lean pork</p>

  <p class="ing">½ tsp. sugar</p>

  <p class="ing">¼ lb. (115 g.) bacon</p>

  <p class="ing">½ tsp. cloves</p>

  <p class="ing">½ lb. (225 g.) veal</p>

  <p class="ing">½ tsp. ginger</p>

  <p class="ing">3 tbsp. potato flour</p>

  <p class="ing">½ tsp. nutmeg, freshly grated</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ½ tbsp. salt</p>

  <p class="ing">2 cups (5 dl) cold milk</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ½ tsp. pepper</p>

  <p class="ingl">Sausage casings</p>

  <p class="noindent">Grind meat six times and add spices. Add milk a little at a time and mix well. Add the potato flour and work well. Stuff casings loosely. Tie. Cook a small ball to taste for correct seasoning. Simmer sausages 15–20 minutes. Keep in the refrigerator in the stock, on which a “lid” of fat will form. If this lid is not broken the sausage will keep quite some time. Before serving, cut into 3–4 inch (7 ½–10 cm) lengths and brown lightly over low heat in butter or margarine.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="bold">Note:</span> In place of sausages, patties can be made from this mixture. Fry slowly over medium heat.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">5 ½ lbs. (2 ½ kg.) mutton, from shoulder, neck, and flank</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tbsp. sugar</p>

  <p class="ing">½ tbsp. pepper</p>

  <p class="ing">1⅛ lb. (450 g) fresh pork fat</p>

  <p class="ing">Sausage casings, 4 yds. (meters)</p>

  <p class="ingl">3½–4 cups (8–9 dl) stock or water</p>

  <p class="noindent">Debone the meat and cut into strips. Cut pork fat into strips. Crack the bones, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Skim and let simmer to make stock, approximately 1 hour. Strain and chill. Grind meat and fat once. Add the salt and refrigerate for 12 hours. Whisk the potato starch, sugar, and seasonings into the cold stock. Gradually add to the meat mixture. Do not overwork the meat. Rinse the sausage casings well. (Read directions, they might have to be soaked in water for several hours.) Then stuff with mixture but not too tightly that might cause sausages to burst open. Tie securely at 16-inch (40-cm) intervals. Smoke 3–4 hours. Simmer in lightly-salted water about 20 minutes. Serve with boiled potatoes and mashed rutabagas, preferably along with <span class="italic">pinnekjøtt.</span> Cold Voss sausages are good as sandwich meats and add a delicious flavor to soups and stews.</p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="italic">The Sami people are usually thought of as different groups according to the activities they carry out. The “Mountain Sami,” the nomad people of Northern Scandinavia and Russia, are the typical Sami. The precious reindeer means life to the Sami people; they use every part. Bones and horns are used for objects and ornaments, skin for clothes and boots, and the priceless meat sustains life.</span></p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/66-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">5 lbs. (2 ¼ kg.) leg of reindeer</p>

  <p class="ing">Strips of suet, ¼-inch (5 mm) thick</p>

  <p class="ing">½ cup (1 ¼ dl) butter</p>

  <p class="ing">Salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="ing">1 cup (2 ½ dl) whole milk, warm</p>

  <p class="ingl">1 cup (2 ½ dl) water</p>

  <p class="ing">Sauce:</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ½ tbsp. butter</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tbsp. flour</p>

  <p class="ing">2 cups sour cream</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tsp. red currant jelly</p>

  <p class="ingl">1 slice brown goat cheese</p>

  <p class="noindent">Wash meat in cold water and dry well. Trim off fat and excess skin (not the membrane that keeps muscles together). Game meat tends to be rather dry and should be larded. With a thin, sharp knife, make deep holes or pockets in meat and stuff in strips of suet. Tie the roast, and rub with salt and pepper. Brown butter in a large, heavy pot on top of the stove. An iron pot is preferred. Grease thoroughly with butter or margarine before using. Place meat in a pot, meaty side down. Brown well on all sides, adding more butter as needed. Turn with two wooden spoons to avoid pricking meat. When brown, pour on the warm milk and water, and reduce heat. Cover, leaving lid slightly ajar to allow steam to escape. Cook slowly 2–2 ½ hours, basting meat occasionally. Add more milk and water as needed to keep meat covered about two thirds. When cooking is completed, remove meat and keep warm.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="bold">Sauce:</span> Brown butter, stir in flour, and add drippings from roast a little at a time, stirring constantly to make a smooth, medium thin sauce (the sour cream will thicken it). Cook 5–8 minutes. Stir in sour cream, currant jelly, and goat cheese. Add salt, if necessary. Let simmer a while but do not boil. Slice and arrange meat on warm serving platter. Decorate with parsley and tomatoes. Serve sauce in a separate dish. Accompanied with parsleyed, steam-dried potatoes, or small browned potatoes, and any kind of green vegetable (Brussels sprouts or peas are very good). If available, rowanberry jelly with its sharp flavor is an excellent accompaniment to any game.</p>

  <p class="h3">Veal Roast (Kalvestek)</p>

  <p class="noindent">May be treated in the same manner as reindeer roast without the larding, and tastes delicious served with the above sauce.</p>

  <p class="h3">Beef (Oksekjøtt)</p>

  <p class="noindent">When defrosting, take from the freezer and leave in the refrigerator until defrosted. This prevents too much of the juice from seeping out and keeps the meat tender. Be sure a frying pan is well heated before adding butter or margarine. Use just a little butter/margarine, let it melt thoroughly, and let the foam subside before adding <a id="page_67"/>the meat. Fry beef of about the same thickness at the same time. And do not put too much meat in the pan at the same time; this cools the pan too much. Wait to add salt until meat is done. Salt draws the juices out and leaves the meat dry. Do not puncture the meat when turning; this too will cause juice to seep out.</p>

  <p class="h3">Hash (Pytt i panne)</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">1–1 ½ lbs. (450–675 g.) beef, lamb,</p>

  <p class="noindent1">Serves 6–8</p>

  <p class="h3">Swiss Steak (Bankekjøtt)</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ½ lbs. (675 g.) beef roast or 1-inch (2 ½-cm) thick</p>

  <p class="ing">2 ½ cups (6 ¼ dl) water</p>

  <p class="ing">2 onions, med., sliced</p>

  <p class="ingl">1 bay leaf</p>

  <p class="noindent">Cut meat in thin slices and dry well with paper towels before browning in margarine. (If round steak is used, pound with meat mallet; it breaks up tough fibers.) Proceed as with roast.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Remove meat from pan to kettle. After each browning, add a little of the 2 ½ cups (6 ¼ dl) water and bring to a boil, pour over meat. Eventually add remaining water. Add bay leaf, salt, pepper, and simmer until meat is tender. Make a paste of flour and a little water and stir into meat juice to make gravy. Simmer 6–8 minutes. Add onion which has been browned in a little margarine. Taste for seasoning.</p>

  <p class="ing">½ tsp. ginger</p>

  <p class="ingl">Milk or water</p>

  <p class="noindent">Cook marrow bones in salted water (skim water as necessary) long enough to remove marrow in one piece. Continue cooking bones to make bouillon for sauce. Have meat cut into thin slices as for steak rolls. Pound meat lightly. Work ground meat and spices together with a small amount of milk or water. On each slice of meat (individual serving size) put one tablespoon ground meat and flatten. Top with a portion of marrow. Roll up and tie with string. Brown well in butter. Add strained bouillon from bones, to cover. Allow to simmer about an hour, or until meat is tender.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="bold">Brown sauce:</span> Brown 2 tablespoons butter and stir in 1 ½ tablespoons flour until smooth. Gradually add stock from the “birds,” stirring constantly.

  <p class="noindent1">Serves 8</p>

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_68"/>Roasted Pork Loin with Fruits (Svinestek med frukt)</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">8 medium-sized prunes, pitted</p>

  <p class="ing">5 lbs. (2 ¼ kg.) pork loin, cut and deboned</p>

  <p class="ing">8 medium-sized apricots, dried</p>

  <p class="ing">Salt and freshly ground pepper</p>

  <p class="ing">1 Granny Smith apple, large</p>

  <p class="ing">Butter and oil</p>

  <p class="ingl">Lemon juice</p>

  <p class="noindent">Cover prunes and apricots with cold water and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and let fruit rest in water for half an hour. Peel, core, and cut apple in 1-inch (2 ½-cm) pieces. Sprinkle with lemon juice to prevent discoloring. Push the handle of a wooden spoon in through the center of the meat; repeat on the other side. Remove fruit from water and pat dry with paper towels. Mix with apples and push fruit into the meat with the wooden spoon handle until all fruit is used, and fruit is within ½-inch (1 ¼-cm) of either side. Season roast well with salt and pepper. Tie string firmly around the roast and secure at ends. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).</p>

  <p class="noindent">In a casserole large enough to hold pork loin, and melt a little butter and oil over moderate heat. Let foam subside then add pork loin, turning it from time to time with two wooden spoons. It will take about 20 minutes to brown the loin evenly on all sides. With a bulb baster remove all the fat from casserole. Pour in 2 cups water and bring to a simmer. Cover the pan tightly and place in a preheated oven for approximately 1 ½ hours, or until the meat shows no resistance when pierced with a sharp knife. Serve with boiled-steamed potatoes, green beans, cauliflower, and stirred lingonberries or jam.</p>

  <p class="h3">Christmas Spiced Ribs (Julekrydret ribbe)</p>

  <p class="noindent">Make a generous portion and it will be sure to disappear. Get your butcher to cut you ribs with the rind attached.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">2 lbs. (2 kg.) pork ribs with rind</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tbsp. ginger, fresh and minced</p>

  <p class="ing">3 tsp. salt</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tsp. anise seeds</p>

  <p class="ing">½ tsp. pepper</p>

  <p class="ingl">1 tbsp. cloves, whole</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/68-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent">Be sure to have the butcher cut the bones all the way through. With a sharp, pointed knife, make cuts through the rind with the knife barely touching the fat. Cut the rinds in diamonds parallel with the bones; it will make it easier to slice nice rib pieces following baking. Peel and mince the ginger and grind the anise seeds in a mortar. Rub the prepared spices into the ribs 1 to 3 days before baking, cover tightly, and refrigerate. Rub salt and spices into the meat, and place the whole cloves around in the meat and the rind. Take care that the spice is rubbed well between the rind and the bones. Cover the ribs and place in the refrigerator to give the spices a chance to absorb into the meat. When meat is removed there will be a little liquid in the bottom of the pan. Rub this into the meat before baking. Place the ribs in a pan with the rind up. Place a small plate underneath the ribs in the center. This will cause the grease to run off. Having the ribs even on both sides while baking will give you a nice-looking rib. Pour ¼ cup (1 ¾ dl) water over the ribs and cover with foil. Place the ribs in the middle of a preheated oven at 450ºF (230ºC) and bake for 45 minutes. Remove foil and reduce temperature to 390ºF (200ºC). Continue baking for 2–2 ½ hours depending on the thickness of the meat. Often the ribs will get a crisp rind while baking; if not, you can place the pan a little higher up in the oven and increase the temperature to 480ºF (250ºC). Watch carefully.</p>

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_69"/>Pork Loin with Rib Section (Ribbe)</p>

  <p class="noindent5"><span class="italic">Ribbe is a must sometime during the Christmas holidays in Norway, always accompanied with sweet sour cabbage and stirred lingonberries, or lingonberry jam. Read the whole recipe before purchasing meat.</span></p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">4 lbs. (1 kg. 800 g.) pork loin</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tsp. pepper</p>

  <p class="ing">rib cage with rind</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tsp. ginger</p>

  <p class="ingl">1 tsp. salt</p>

  <p class="noindent">If you purchase the center ribs have your butcher saw across the bones between the chops so that they will be easy to separate when serving. The ribs also need to be sawn slightly apart with 2 ¼-inch (5 ½-cm) intervals. If you do it yourself use a hacksaw to be sure the bones are nearly cut through, otherwise it will be difficult to get nice serving pieces. Generously rub salt and pepper into the rind, place with the rind side down, cover, and refrigerate for 48 hours before baking.</p>

  <p class="indent">Rub salt, pepper, and ginger liberally into the rind. To get a crisp crackling make diamond slits in the rind, being careful not to make the slits too deep into the rind. In a large roasting pan place the rib cage on a rack with the rind side facing down. Pour 1 cup (2 ½ dl) boiling water into the pan. Cover the whole pan completely with aluminum foil, place on the lowest rack in an oven preheated to 450°F (230°C), and steam for 15 minutes; this helps to retain the juices. Remove from the oven. Reset oven to 350°F (175°).</p>

  <p class="indent">Remove the rib cage and foil and build an even bed of foil on the rack to allow the ribs to be evenly baked; place the ribs with rind up on top of the foil and return to the baking pan. Place uncovered pan in center of the oven. Baste with drippings from time to time and bake until done—2–2 ½ hours should do nicely. During the last half hour no basting is required. If the rib cage browns too quickly, place a piece of foil on top. If you desire an even crisper crackling, place the rib cage, rind-side up, under the broiler for a few minutes. Watch carefully to prevent burning. Pour off and strain the fat from the ribs and serve as sauce with the ribs.</p>

  <p class="h3">Roasted Fresh Ham with Crackling (Skinkestek)</p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="italic">In our home it would not be Christmas Eve without skinkestek. For others it is a must some time during the Christmas season. There is not a great demand for fresh ham with the rind on in America, but keep looking; you will find a butcher who knows what you are talking about.</span></p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">12–14 lbs. (5 ½–6 ¼ kg.) fresh ham</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tbsp. flour</p>

  <p class="ing">3 tsp. salt</p>

  <p class="ing">½ tsp. mustard</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tsp. pepper</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ½ tsp. red wine or</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tbsp. margarine</p>

  <p class="ingl">1 tsp. vinegar</p>

  <p class="noindent">Have your butcher remove the ham hock. Wash ham well. One of the bonuses of fresh ham is the crisp crackling. To achieve this crisp crackling the rind must be quite moist. Soak the ham in cold water overnight with the rind side completely submerged in the water. Or steam, rind side down, 10–15 minutes on a rack over boiling water in the roaster (reserve this water to be used later for basting). Steaming the ham makes it much easier to carve. Remove from the roaster and, with a very sharp knife, make diamond slits in the rind, being careful not to cut into the fat or meat. Rub salt and pepper thoroughly into the rind.</p>

  <p class="indent">Return to roaster and bake in preheated 450°F (230°C) oven for 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 275°F (135°C) and bake until done, at 25 minutes per pound. Baste ham with the drippings every 20 minutes up to the last half hour. Allow the ham to remain in oven for balance of roasting period with the oven door slightly ajar. Remove all grease from drippings and add boiling water. Make brown gravy from margarine, flour, and drippings. Simmer 10 minutes. Add seasonings and red wine or vinegar to taste. Remove rind carefully and serve with the ham as an added delicacy. Serve with boiled potatoes, sweet-sour cabbage, and lingonberries.</p>

  <p class="h3">Roast Duck (Stekt and)</p>

  <p class="noindent">Ducks are easy to prepare and are a true taste treat. Brussels sprouts, green peas, or onions are vegetables that combine well with either duck or goose. If frozen, allow it to defrost in refrigerator.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">1 4–5 lb. (1 ¾–2 ¼ kg.) duck</p>

  <p class="ing">½ lemon</p>

  <p class="ing">Salt</p>

  <p class="ing">¼ cup (½ dl) consommé, boiling</p>

  <p class="ing">White pepper</p>

  <p class="ing">1 cup (2 ½ dl) beef bouillon</p>

  <p class="ing">2 oranges</p>

  <p class="ingl">Cornstarch</p>

  <p class="noindent">Preheat the oven to 450°F (235°C). Wash duck under cold running water and dry with paper towels. Rub cavity with salt and pepper. Prick the surface of the <span class="italic">lower</span> part of the breast, around the thighs and back, with a small sharp knife to produce a crisper crust. Truss the bird securely. Place on rack in shallow roaster and bake until light brown. Remove fat from roasting pan with a bulb baster. Reduce heat to 350°F (175°C) and continue roasting. Baste with boiling bouillon from time to time. After 1 ½ hours’ roasting time pour off juice into separate pan. Add to this consommé, juice of 2 oranges, and ½ a lemon, and thicken with a little cornstarch. Salt to taste. Bring to boiling point but do not boil. Pour gravy evenly over duck and return to 450°F (235°C) oven until a golden film is formed on the bird. Remove to a heated platter. Decorate with greens and orange slices. Let the bird rest 10 minutes for easier carving. Duck may be baked with or without stuffing using same dressing as for goose. To test for doneness, pierce the thigh with a small sharp knife. If the juice that runs out is clear yellow, the duck is done.</p>

  <p class="noindent1">Serves 4–5</p>

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_71"/><span class="red">Roast Goose (Stekt g</span><span class="red">å</span><span class="red">s)</span></p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">1 goose, 9 lbs. (4 kg.)</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ½ lbs. (675 g.) apples</p>

  <p class="ing">Lemon</p>

  <p class="ing">½ lb. (225 g.) prunes</p>

  <p class="ingl">Salt</p>

  <p class="noindent">Preheat the oven to 450° (235°C). Wash the goose under cold, running water, and dry with paper towels. Rub salt and lemon in the cavity and outside of the bird. Pour 2 cups of boiling water over prunes and soak until limp. Drain and chop. Peel and dice apples. Combine with prunes and pack loosely into the cavity of the bird. Fasten neck skin to back of goose and truss bird. For crisper skin, prick the lower part of the breast. Place the bird on a rack in a large, shallow pan, and reduce heat to 350°F (175°), allowing 25 minutes per pound. Remove fat with a bulb baster. The goose is rather fatty, which makes basting unnecessary. Pierce the thigh with a small sharp knife to determine doneness. If the juice that runs out is clear yellow, the goose is done. For easier carving turn oven off and with oven door ajar, let goose rest in the oven for 15 minutes.</p>

  <p class="h3">Roasted Ptarmigan Breasts (Stekt rypebryst)</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">4 ptarmigans</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tsp. salt</p>

  <p class="ing">Pepper</p>

  <p class="ing">Butter</p>

  <p class="ing5">Broth:</p>

  <p class="ing">Water to cover meat</p>

  <p class="ing">1 carrot, sliced</p>

  <p class="ing">1 stalk celery, chopped</p>

  <p class="ing">2 tbsp. onion, chopped</p>

  <p class="ing">Juniper berries</p>

  <p class="ing">White pepper, to taste</p>

  <p class="ing">Thyme to taste</p>

  <p class="ing5">Gravy:</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ¾ cups (4 ¼ dl) ptarmigan broth</p>

  <p class="ing">½ cup (1 ¼ dl) whipping cream</p>

  <p class="ing">3–4 tbsp. sour cream</p>

  <p class="ing">Salt and pepper to taste</p>

  <p class="ingl">3 tbsp. cornstarch</p>

  <p class="noindent">Defrost the ptarmigans in the refrigerator; rinse in cold running water and dry with paper towels. Cut away breasts. Chop the remainder of meat and brown in butter. Add cold water to cover and remaining ingredients for broth. Bring to a boil, skim, and let simmer uncovered for about 1–1½ hours. Strain and let it simmer until it is condensed to 1⅔ cups (3 ¾ dl). Add cream, sour cream, and thicken with cornstarch. Season to taste with salt and pepper. In a warm pan brown the breasts in butter. Salt and pepper, and bake in a warm oven 435°F (225°C) for 7–8 minutes. The meat should be juicy and pinkish. Remove from the oven and let rest covered under aluminum foil for 10–15 minutes. You can serve the breasts whole or sliced. Serve with gravy and cooked small red potatoes. Carrots, baby peas, cauliflower, or broccoli are good vegetable accompaniment. So are lingonberries or a tart jelly. (Troll Cream (<a href="../Text/021_Chapter013.html#page_98">p.98</a>) or Veiled Wilderness Girls (<a href="../Text/021_Chapter013.html#page_104">p. 104</a>) make a perfect dessert.)</p>

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_72"/>Hare or Rabbit (Stekt hare eller kanin)</p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="italic">It is impossible for me to think “rabbit” without remembering the year 1943 when we lived at Nesodden.</span></p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/72-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="noindent">During WWII, Norway was occupied by the Germans who rounded up many construction workers, including Pappa, and sent them on work projects far away. Mamma was left with four children to care for and began to raise rabbits. They multiplied quickly, and when some time later word came that the Germans were coming to check every farm, mamma killed, skinned, and canned every one of the ninety-three rabbits, and shared this great food with family and neighbors.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Ingredients:</p>

  <p class="ing">1 rabbit or hare</p>

  <p class="ing">Vinegar and water</p>

  <p class="ing">5 tbsp. margarine</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tsp. salt, scant</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ½ cups (3 ¾ dl) milk</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ½ cups (3 ¾ dl) water</p>

  <p class="ing1">Gravy:</p>

  <p class="ing">2 ½ tbsp. margarine</p>

  <p class="ing">4 tbsp. flour</p>

  <p class="ing">1 ⅔–2 cups (2 ¾–5 dl) broth</p>

  <p class="ing">1 cup (2 ½ dl) sour cream</p>

  <p class="ingl">Salt</p>

  <p class="noindent">Wash rabbit thoroughly. Place in vinegar solution (1 tablespoon vinegar to 1 quart (liter)) water overnight. Remove heavy membranes and sinews (they are not present in domestic rabbits). Be careful not to cut or tear the meat. Chop off thighs and forelegs. Divide back in two and then cut into appropriate-size serving pieces. Melt margarine in a cast-iron pan. When foam subsides, add the meat and brown well on both sides. Season. Remove from pan while making gravy of margarine, flour, and broth. Return meat to the gravy and let simmer over low heat for about 1 ½ hours. Domestic rabbit usually takes less cooking time than hare. Just before serving transfer to heated platter; keep warm. While stirring, add sour cream to gravy and bring to a quick boil. Pour over meat. Serve with whole lingonberry or cranberry sauce.</p>
