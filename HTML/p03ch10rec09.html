<p class="summary1">Chestnut trees are part of many a Spanish landscape. In northwest Spain, chestnuts were a staple before the arrival of potatoes and corn from the New World. They were worshipped by the Celts. In Galicia, they say that carrying a chestnut in your pocket will keep away the <span class="italic">meigas</span> (witches). Peasants dried them and made them into bread, and they are still used as a side vegetable, to accompany pork, game, and turkey. In Galicia and Asturias, chestnuts are much used in soups and stews and in cakes. For a garnish, they are boiled in water or milk and served whole or mashed. There are chestnut festivals across the chestnut-growing regions at the beginning of November.</p>
