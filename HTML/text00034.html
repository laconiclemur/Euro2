<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Confirmation in the Finnish Lutheran Church</a>
</h1>
<p class="pf">Sitting around a table with a cup of coffee today, my friends and I often exchange our confirmation stories. Some of my friends grew up in churches other than Lutheran and never were confirmed. In the Lutheran church, confirmation is considered simply an affirmation of our baptism—and not a “rite of passage.” At least that is what I have come to believe. When I grew up, it was after confirmation that one was considered an adult in the church and could receive communion, the Eucharist, or the Lord’s Supper.</p>
<p>Preparing for confirmation for me and my Finnish friends in Floodwood consisted of two weeks of classes in the summertime. I biked into town each day with my Bible and confirmation books in the basket of my blue Schwinn two-wheeler. I loved my Bible history book. It had a pinkish-orange cover and had a wonderful new-book aroma.</p>
<p>There are three phrases from my confirmation days that have stuck with me all my life. Three phrases that actually have little to do with the building of faith—or the opposite. These three phrases remind me of my heritage, of the bit of humor I grew up with, and of a wonderful relationship with the church. I credit this to Pastor Könönen, who preached in Finnish and had limited English.</p>
<p>He would start our lessons each day with a few of his limited English phrases. I don’t remember the order but one of them was, “I vonce had opportunity,” after which he would trail off into Finnish. Another was, “It is my obligation . . . ,” again lapsing into Finnish, and the third was, “I have gum [come] to the conclusion . . .”</p>
<p>We never did know what his opportunities, his obligations, or his conclusions were, but the phrases give me a little inward chuckle when I think of them.</p>
<p>My friend Joyce, a fellow confirmand, and I would address each other with, “Have you come to any conclusions lately?” Or, “Have you had any opportunities recently?” Or, “Do you have any obligations today?”</p>
<p>These remembrances might not seem very faith inspiring, but to me they fix my memories in a positive way to my confirmation days.</p>

<p>My special white confirmation dress had a delicious texture: it was made of a white piqué with a white lace inset at the yoke. I wore that dress only once. The day after my confirmation we packaged it up and sent it to relatives in Finland who had very limited resources (the Finnish–Russian war had just ended). A second cousin wore the same dress for her confirmation in Kurikka, Finland. We sent other things, too: coffee, sugar, nylons, cotton socks, even shoes. I could say that opportunity, obligation, and conclusions also were sent with the package.</p>
