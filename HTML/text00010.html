<h2 class="h2a">-TURKEY IN WALNUT SAUCE-</h2>
<p class="para1">
<strong>This recipe is the Georgian version of Christmas turkey. My great grandparents used to make this a couple of days ahead and leave it suspended in a well in their garden until it was ready to be served.</strong>
</p>
<p class="sides">
<strong>Preparation time: 40 minutes, plus resting time</strong>
</p>
<p class="sides">
<strong>Cooking time: 2 hours 30 minutes</strong>
</p>
<p class="sides1">
<strong>Serves 6</strong>
</p>
<p class="side">1 medium turkey (approximately 6 kg/13 lb 4 oz)</p>
<p class="side">250 g/9 oz/1¾ cups walnut halves</p>
<p class="side">4 garlic cloves</p>
<p class="side">1 tsp ground coriander</p>
<p class="side">1 tsp ground marigold</p>
<p class="side">1 tsp ground blue fenugreek</p>
<p class="side">3 onions, finely chopped</p>
<p class="side">1 tsp ground cinnamon</p>
<p class="side">½ tsp ground cloves</p>
<p class="side">2 eggs</p>
<p class="side">1 tbsp apple cider vinegar or white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="side1">sea salt, to taste</p>
<p class="para1">Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6.</p>
<p class="para1">Place the turkey in a large stockpot and cover with 3 litres/5 pints of water. Place over a high heat and bring the water to the boil. Skim any scum from the top of the water, reduce the heat to a simmer and leave to cook for 1 hour 15 minutes, until the turkey is cooked through. Remove the turkey from the stockpot and transfer to a large roasting dish. Place a couple of ladlefuls of the cooking water in the base of a large roasting dish and place the turkey on top, breast-side up. Set the rest of the turkey stock aside to cool. Transfer the turkey to the preheated oven and cook, basting occasionally, for around 45 minutes until golden. Check that it is cooked through and continue roasting if needed. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.</p>
<p class="para1">Once the turkey stock has completely cooled, a layer of solidified fat should have formed over the top. Remove the fat from the stock and place in a separate bowl. Set the stock and the fat aside.</p>
<p class="para1">Place the walnuts in a food processor and process to a very fine paste. The paste should be sticky and smooth, but not at all grainy (this can take up to 5 minutes). Crush the garlic with the back of a knife and then put in a mortar with a pinch of sea salt. Grind with a pestle to a smooth paste. Place the walnut and garlic pastes in a large bowl with the ground coriander, marigold and fenugreek. Add 2 tablespoons of the reserved turkey stock to the bowl and use your hands to bring the mixture together to a smooth paste. Gradually add enough of the remaining turkey stock to the bowl. Stir to dissolve the walnut paste in the liquid to the consistency of single (light) cream. Set aside.</p>
<p class="para1"><a id="page_125"></a>
 Place the reserved turkey fat in a large pan over a medium heat. Once hot, add the onions and cook, stirring continuously, until just turning golden. Pour the walnut sauce over the onions and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, then add the cinnamon and cloves to the pan and stir to combine. Cook for 10 minutes more.</p>
<p class="para1">Crack the eggs into a small bowl with the vinegar and whisk to combine. Pour the eggs into the pan with the sauce and leave until they have coloured and are starting to bubble. Stir to break up the eggs and mix throughout the sauce. Cook for 10 minutes more, season to taste and set aside to cool slightly.</p>
<p class="para">Carve the turkey into large chunks and place the meat in a large serving bowl or platter. Pour the sauce over the turkey and set aside until completely cool. In Georgia, this is traditionally served once a layer of jelly has formed on top.</p>

<h2 class="h2a">-POUSSIN IN GARLIC AND WALNUT SAUCE-</h2>
<p class="para1">
<strong>This is an impressive main course that is packed with flavour. The walnuts give the sauce a rich texture and flavour that is enhanced by the fiery raw garlic and the juices from the cooked meat — so make sure you have lots of fresh bread on hand to mop it up. The ingredients given here are for a single serving, but scale it up to suit the number of guests you have.</strong>

<strong>Preparation time: 20 minutes, plus at least 2 hours’ marinating time</strong>

<strong>Cooking time: 25 minutes</strong>
</p>
<p class="sides1">
<strong>Serves 1</strong>
</p>
<p class="side">
<strong>For the poussin:</strong>
</p>
<p class="side">5 tbsp sunflower or olive oil</p>
<p class="side">½ tsp chilli powder</p>
<p class="side">½ tsp salt</p>
<p class="side">½ tsp paprika</p>
<p class="side1">1 corn-fed poussin (approximately 300 g/10½ oz), spatchcocked</p>

<strong>For the sauce:</strong>
</p>
<p class="side">50 g/1¾ oz/scant ½ cup chopped walnuts</p>
<p class="side">3 garlic cloves, crushed</p>
<p class="side">1 tsp sea salt flakes</p>
<p class="side1">250 ml/9 fl oz/generous 1 cup boiled and cooled water</p>
<p class="side">
<strong>To serve:</strong>
</p>
<p class="side1">fresh bread</p>
<p class="para1">The poussin can be prepared up to a day ahead. In a small bowl, combine the oil, chilli powder, salt and paprika and mix well to combine. Place the poussin in a shallow dish and pour over the oil and spice mixture to coat. Cover the poussin and transfer to the fridge to marinade for at least 2 hours or overnight.</p>
<p class="para1">Preheat the oven to 240°C/475°F/gas mark 9 and line a baking sheet with foil.</p>
<p class="para1">Place the marinated poussin and its juices on the baking sheet and transfer to the preheated oven to cook for 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="para1">Meanwhile, make the walnut sauce. Place the walnuts in a food processor and process on a high speed until you have a smooth, wet paste. Transfer the walnut paste to a small bowl and set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">Put the crushed garlic cloves and salt in a mortar and grind with a pestle until you have a very smooth consistency. Add the garlic to the walnut paste and use your hands to combine.</p>
<p class="para1">Now, gradually add the water to the garlic and walnut paste, dissolving the paste in the water each time you add a little more. Keep adding water until the sauce is a thickness you are happy with — you are looking for it to just coat the back of a spoon. Season to taste.</p>
<p class="para1">Once the poussin is cooked, remove it from the oven and pour any cooking juices into the walnut sauce, stirring to combine.</p>
<p class="para">Place the poussin on a chopping board and divide into halves or quarters, then transfer to a serving plate. Pour over the walnut and garlic sauce and serve immediately with fresh bread alongside for mopping up the sauce.</p>

 spice mix and sprinkle half of it over the pomegranate, then repeat the layers, continuing to season between each layer, ending with a final sprinkling of the spice mix. Sprinkle the dried summer savory over the top, then cover the pan and transfer to the fridge for 3–4 hours to allow the flavours to settle and develop.</p>
<p class="para1">When you are ready to cook, remove the dish from the fridge and place over a low heat. Sit the whole head of garlic, if using, on top of the layered chicken and place the lid back on the pan. Cook for 2 hours, until the chicken is cooked and deliciously moist.</p>

Season with salt, pepper and chilli powder and transfer to the preheated oven to cook for 20 minutes, turning the livers over halfway through cooking.</p>
<p class="para1">Meanwhile, place the remaining 150 ml/5 fl oz/generous ½ cup of oil in a large pan over a medium heat. Once hot, add the onions and cook, stirring continuously, until soft and just starting to turn golden, about 10 minutes. Add the wine to the pan and continue to cook over a gentle heat, stirring occasionally, until all the alcohol has dissolved, about 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="para1">Add the pomegranate molasses to the pan and stir to combine. Cook for 5 minutes more, stirring occasionally, then add the ground coriander and summer savory to the pan and stir to combine.</p>

<strong>Serves 1</strong>
</p>
<p class="side">1 corn-fed poussin (approximately 300 g/10½ oz), spatchcocked</p>
<p class="side">1 tbsp apple cider vinegar or white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="side">3 garlic cloves</p>
<p class="side">1 tsp ground coriander</p>
<p class="side">½ tsp sea salt</p>
<p class="side">1 tsp ground blue fenugreek</p>
<p class="side">4 tbsp vegetable or sunflower oil</p>
<p class="side">¼ tsp red chilli powder</p>
<p class="side">¼ tsp paprika</p>
<p class="side1">new potatoes and <em>Tkemali</em>
 (Plum Sauce, see <a href="text00005.html#page_22">here</a>
 ), to serve</p>
<p class="para1">Place the poussin in a snug-fitting bowl.</p>
<p class="para1">Place the garlic in a mortar and grind with a pestle to a smooth paste, adding a dash of water if the mixture is too dry. Add the ground coriander, salt, blue fenugreek, oil, chilli powder and paprika to this mixture and stir to combine.</p>
<p class="para1">Pour the spice mixture over the poussin, using your hands to ensure that the poussin is well coated. Cover and transfer to the fridge for at least 1 hour, but ideally overnight.</p>
<p class="para1">When you are ready to cook the poussin, place a large frying pan (skillet) over a medium heat. Once hot, lay the poussin in the pan breast-side down, then lay a pan lid or plate over the top and weigh it down with something heavy (tins from your kitchen cupboard work well). Cook the poussin until the base is golden, around 10 minutes. Remove the pan lid or plate, then flip the poussin in the pan and cook for another 10 minutes until golden and cooked through.</p>

<em>Late Summer, spiced pan-fried poussin with my great uncle in a village in western Georgia</em>
</p>
<p class="para1">
<strong>At the end of summer, I would often go to stay with my grandfather’s brother in his village in western Georgia. I was very little and I loved spending time there. My great uncle used to wake me up when it was sunrise and I would run barefoot through the dewy grass. Outside there was a big pot of water that the sun gradually warmed, making it hot enough to bathe in.</strong>
</p>
<p class="para1">
<strong>My special place was a big tree that was over 100 years old; there was a swing for me on a branch and a bird’s nest on a bough. An old man called Vene lived with my family in a little house in their garden and I loved the stories he told me. I used to go to his house in the morning and wake him up. His house smelled of corn sacks and wood smoke, and there were chickens scratching around and little mice hiding in the nooks and crannies. He passed away when I was four years old and it was the first time that I experienced the sadness of death. Before lunch he used to have a little nap underneath my tree and I remember wondering how many people had shared their secrets with the tree. After lunch every day, my aunt and I picked blackberries while <em>tabaka</em>
 roasted in the fireplace. We would then prepare walnut or blackberry sauce to serve with it. The poussin had deliciously crisp skin, but the flesh was tender and moist. Although we ate it every day, I never once grew tired of it.</strong>

<strong>I also used to visit during the wine harvest in early autumn. I remember one evening where I walked in the vineyard with Vene. It was a beautiful night and the vineyard looked magical. He held freshly picked grapes and they seemed to float in his palm. I remember the amber colour playing against drops of falling rain so that it looked like they were weeping. He said to me in the softest of voices, ‘Look at the grapes. They look like beautiful women, you look at them and are captivated. It’s like a magic potion, one sip and you are forever in love’.</strong>
