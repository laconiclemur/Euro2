<p class="calibre_" id="filepos1444"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">Introduction</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_3"><span class="calibre_2">In November 2004, a Pole, Miroslaw Gebarowski, became so dissatisfied with the deteriorating state of Polish meat products that he decided to do something about it. He started a Polish forum on the Internet dedicated to the proper methods of meat preparation and the idea took off like a roller coaster. At that time Stanley Marianski lived in the USA and one day at a party he was arguing with his friends over some Polish sausage recipes. He jumped on the Internet and started to look for more information but the information he found in English was far from satisfactory. Finally in desperation he formed the question in Polish and imagine the surprise when he found his answer on the newly created forum. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">That started the relationship that continues to this day. The Forum became so popular that in February 2005 its web presence was established </span><a href="http://www.wedlinydomowe.pl"><span class="calibre_2">www.wedlinydomowe.pl</span></a><span class="calibre_2"> (Polish version) and the English site </span><a href="http://www.wedlinydomowe.com"><span class="calibre_2">www.wedlinydomowe.com</span></a><span class="calibre_2"> (presently </span><a href="http://www.meatsandsausages.com"><span class="calibre_2">www.meatsandsausages.com</span></a><span class="calibre_2">) soon followed. At present, with 30,000 members, the Polish site is the biggest site of its kind in the world. The explanation for this incredible popularity of the site was the general dissatisfaction with the steady decline in quality, of once great meat products which can be traced to the collapse of the communist system in Poland and joining the European Common Market. The country opened up to Western Europe and this introduced new chemicals and preparation procedures which were designed to produce products in the fastest and cheapest way. Unfortunately, those changes resulted in processed meats of lower quality. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">The home based sausage maker does not face those problems and for him the quality of his sausage is of the utmost importance, after all he and his family will eat it. Besides, for most people sausage making is a hobby from which they derive pleasure and the time spent is not a limiting factor. Having unlimited time and putting his heart into the process, he can create a product that is superior to the one available in the supermarket. In the pages that follow you will find everything about the production of sausages, covering topics like meat technology, curing, home style smoking, and even some old-fashioned tips and advice.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">By carefully reading the material presented in this book and making different sausages, one can become an accomplished sausage maker in no time at all. He will be able to produce superior quality sausages and they will be made without chemicals. We can proudly say that this book represents over 500 years of sausage making, as well as all Polish sausage recipes. The following recipes are not just another invention of someone who likes to drink beer and make sausages. They are time proven recipes compiled, checked and enforced by the Polish Government Standards as applied to making meat products after World War II. With their vast resources and university educated meat professionals, the government became the final authority on the subject and took control of enforcing the standards.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Why did the Polish Government Regulate Sausages </span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">The answer is as old as the world itself: the money. When the war ended Communism was forced on Poland which had been a free country before. That isolated the government from the rest of the world and prevented Poland from receiving any assistance from the West. The country was in ruin, some cities were 80 % damaged, every fifth person in the family was dead and the Polish currency “zloty” was not convertible. In other terms, nobody in the free world would accept that currency. The government was not able to purchase goods from other countries nor obtain loans or credits. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">That forced the country to go back in time and start selling natural resources like coal, vodka, fruits and meat products. Those products had to be of an exceptional quality if they were to be accepted in the West and the Government spared no effort. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">The Communistic doctrine says that everything belongs to the state and all independent meat plants were nationalized (became the property of the state). That also applied to sausage making plants and here is where the government excelled. The party members run the meat plants now and they spent half of their time drinking vodka and eating well. Being generally smart, well educated and opportunistic people they could easily determine which sausages tasted the best and they became good judges of quality. The Department of Meat Industry </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">(Centralny Zarząd Przemysłu Mięsnego)</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> was established and those creative people came up with the great idea of standardizing Polish meat products. College educated meat technologists wrote great guides about making meat products which covered processes like meat aging, meat curing, smoking and cooking in great detail. The first 300 page long manual was written in 1958 and contained step by step instructions for making meat products and 70 sausages. The guide was for internal use only and the general public had no access to it. But at least the meat plant managers now had a set of instructions for making quality meat products and those norms were rigidly enforced by the government meat inspectors. This set of regulations was revised in 1964, 1974, 1978 and the years that followed. Even today the Polish Government publishes standards for making Polish sausages. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Unfortunately the latest norms are just a shadow of the detailed instructions from the past and basically they list the meat type and the list of ingredients that should go into a particular product. Today the meat industry consists of hundreds of independent plants and as there is no enforcement from the government, the standards are loosely obeyed. The present products are just echoes from the past.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Some may argue that today’s products are healthier. Well, we agree with that but this is not a diet book. This is a book about making the best tasting products possible. Imitation butter is also healthier than butter but no respectable chef will take a risk of making creamy sauce with an imitation butter. He will be out of the door in a minute as there is no way to replace butter’s great flavor. The same applies to mayonnaise, cream cheese, milk and other products. There is a choice to be made between eating well and eating healthy. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">During the war Mr. Goebels, the German Minister of Propaganda used to say that if the lie is repeated often enough it would become the truth. If you and your wife will start repeating every day that imitation mayonnaise or lean meat sausage taste better because it is healthy, most likely you will eventually and sincerely believe in it and for you it will become the truth. But your friends will hold a different opinion. We are not claiming that the sausages must always be made the way our recipes call for. We are simply offering those recipes with detailed instructions on making them so they will never be forgotten. </span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">Why Did We Make Better Sausages Before?</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">The general consensus in Poland is that Polish meat products were absolutely the best in the years 1950 - 1990 and that statement will probably hold true for other European countries as well. We have the utmost respect for the latest in science and computers but we do think that making meat products might be an isolated case where the technology has lowered the taste of the product. Sausage making has been a dying art and there is almost no way to obtain quality products unless they are home made.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">That does not mean that our meat plants are not capable of making quality products. After all, in 1969 we put a man on the moon, the Internet has been running for 40 years, and computers allow us to change the very rules of nature. So why can’t we make a decent sausage? We can’t because everything is controlled by the dollar, including sausages. They must be made in the most efficient manner, and that means cheap and fast. As long as supermarkets keep on renewing orders, and the Food and Drug Administration does not object to the ingredients, quality plays a secondary role. The job of the FDA is to regulate what chemicals can be added into a product and in what quantities they can be safely used when added to meat. The FDA was not created to judge products according to taste and flavor. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Well, we understand that you cannot change the latest technology as it follows the commands of economics which in turn follows the laws of finance. And those laws dictate that money must be made as this is the nature of business. There are hundreds of marketers that would explain why we produce foods differently today and they will all argue that it is done for the good of the consumer. We also know that there is a growing number of people who don’t care what’s good for the consumer, they care about what’s good for them and that is why they make their own products.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">How Our Book Differs From Others</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">1. Factory procedures.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> This is probably the only written book on sausages that provides factory floor step by step instructions on making different products. It is like revealing the most treasured internal secrets and recipes to the world at large. And this is exactly what we have done: we have revealed sausage recipes and instructions on their making which have been strictly guarded for generations. Go to any sausage making plant and ask the manager for the recipe and detailed instructions of the products his company makes. You will be shown the door. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Just by studying those recipes and instructions one can develop a good feel of the subject. You will see how every part of the animal was utilized to make different types of sausages. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">And these are not recipes that were copied from a neighbor or found somewhere on the Internet.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> These are recipes and production processes of the products that have been made in Poland for centuries and those products were distributed all over the nation for the public to consume. Studying this material a newcomer to the business can easily open his own commercial sausage kitchen and even experienced people will fine tune their skills by just reading this book.</span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">2. Meat Curing for Sausages.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> This book introduces the concept of meat curing for sausages as it has always been practiced in Poland by the general population and the meat plants. This extra processing step improves the looks, texture, taste and the flavor of the product. And this is not a secret, everybody in Poland knows that meat for sausages must be cured. This is something that is almost sacred and not even open for discussion. Even if you decide to continue making sausages without curing meat first, it would be nice to know how it should be done properly.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Yes, meat plants cure hams, butts, loins, bacon and other large pieces of meat. And we have million dollar machines that inject those meats with commercially prepared solutions. But if one opens a sausage book he finds that there is total silence on curing meats for sausages. And curing meats for sausages is not limited to Poland but is practiced in Russia and Germany, both countries famous for their meat products and sausages.</span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_2">3. “Whys”.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> You will find many books that provide valuable information like: remove visible air pockets by pricking casings with a needle, shower smoked products with cold water, boil some sausages and bake others, stuff casings firmly or stuff them loosely, etc. We provide this general information as well but at the same time we go into extreme detail to explain to the reader why it is done that way and not the other. And all those “whys” are what will help you fully understand and master the art of sausage making.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre_7">For Whom is This Book Written</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre_2">Anybody that makes or intends to make Polish sausages or any kind of sausage will greatly benefit from this book. Even Polish butchers that make sausages all over the world should make it a point of reference. We have a label from the popular Polish Kabanosy meat stick made by a butcher plant in New York that calls for beef in addition to pork. For 200 years Kabanosy was always made with pure pork so why mess up the 200 year old recipe?</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">For centuries sausage recipes were not publicized. They were passed from the father to the son, but otherwise kept closely guarded. The government compiled all known recipes together and established manufacturing rules and instructions. They were, however, reserved for internal use only. In other words they were classified. Butchers who were licenced by the Official Trade Associations were issued those detailed sausage standards but to limit competition they kept them strictly to themselves.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">We at Wedliny Domowe have every publication that was written on the subject by the long gone government and we have decided to open up this treasure chest of sausage recipes. There are Polish families living all over the world and kids are definitely introduced to sausages at an early age. One day when older, they will not be able to get the answer from their parents who will not be around forever. And if they decide to make their own Polish sausage this book will be of invaluable help.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">There are many so called Polish sausage recipes floating on the Internet and many originate on some huge sites that employ who write well. This is what they do for a living, they fish for recipes and they place them in a particular category. They did not get the job because they studied meat science, they got the job because they write well. How many do you think have ever made a blood sausage, head cheese or cold smoked salmon? </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">A hard working mother of four does her shopping in a supermarket and buys sliced turkey breast and some sausages. The price is the main factor she’s concerned with. After a few days her kid says: “look Ma, this sliced turkey breast is still juicy”. And Ma acting in her best intentions will reply: “yeah, this is good stuff.” Little she knows that the phosphates and other ingredients have finally lost their binding power and all this juice (slime) is nothing else than the water that was injected with chemicals into the meat during production. Her ignorance is of an innocent kind because she simply does not know any better, but what is tragic is that there are generations of young people who will never find out what the real ham or smoked turkey should taste like. To sell mass produced and passable quality products to a hard working mother of four, all the supermarket has to do is to say: “save money” and “buy one get one free.” That is why we have all those flyers and manufacturer’s coupons. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">This book is written for those people, to wake them up so they can realize that a pork loin, ham or a sausage can have a completely different taste to the one they have been accustomed to. They could order it by mail from some specialty suppliers, or they could buy it from some ethnic butcher stores if still present in the area they live in, or </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_2">they could make it themselves.</span></span><span class="calibre_2"> Our task is to preserve the legacy of those wonderful products, uncover original and authentic recipes and provide instructions on how to make them. That way they will not become a forgotten thing of the past but will live forever. </span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">Our group consists of hundreds of professional and home based sausage makers who have been making those Polish products all their lives. They know how they were made and how they tasted 50 years ago and they can see the difference when they buy the product today. And they all agree as to the authenticity of the following recipes. Fortunately more and more people start making sausages and this book was written for them. Another reason is to preserve the centuries of knowledge and tradition that were instrumental for the development of so many wonderful products.</span></p><p class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre_2">For the novice some recipes may at first look somewhat intimidating as they are loaded with technical information and detailed instructions for their making. We believe the real strength of this book lies exactly in those instructions and by just reading them one can develop a great feel for what sausage making is about. In this chapter we intend to simplify some of the steps used in the production process and make them more acceptable to the average sausage maker. This way he will be able to make any sausage from this book and the key is understanding the basic sausage making steps.</span></p><p class="calibre_4"><span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre_2"> </span></span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre_2"> </span></span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_2"></div>
