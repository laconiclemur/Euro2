  <p class="chap-para">Each Italian region has its own varieties of bread and focaccia. Puglia, the heel of Italy, is renowned for its amazing bread from the town of Altamura, but equally delicious is the potato-based focaccia. The addition of mashed potatoes makes the dough incredibly soft, and with its topping of cherry tomatoes this is a wonderful snack.</p>

  <p class="ing">Makes 1 x 30cm/12-inch round focaccia</p>

  <p class="ing1">12g/¼oz fresh yeast 185ml/6½fl oz/generous ¾ cup</p>

  <p class="ing1">lukewarm water</p>

  <p class="ing1">400g/14 oz/3¼ cups ‘00’ flour</p>

  <p class="ing1">100g/3½oz potato, cooked and mashed</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tsp salt</p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the topping</p>

  <p class="ing1">100g/3½oz cherry tomatoes, halved</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 tsp dried oregano</p>

  <p class="ing2">small handful of fresh basil leaves</p>

  <p class="para">Dissolve the yeast in a little of the water. Put the flour, mashed potato and salt in a large bowl, add the yeast-and-water mixture and gradually add the remaining water to form a smooth dough. Knead on a lightly floured surface for 5 minutes. Form into a ball, cover with clingfilm (plastic wrap) or a clean tea towel and leave to rise in a warm place for about 1½ hours, until it has doubled in size.</p>

  <p class="para">Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6.</p>

  <p class="para">Line a large baking sheet with greaseproof (waxed) paper or baking parchment, place the dough on top and, using your fingers, gently spread the dough to form a rough 30cm/12-inch circle; it will not be as thin as a pizza base. Top with the tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, oregano and the basil leaves. Bake for 30 minutes.</p>

  <p class="para1">Remove from the oven and leave to rest for 5 minutes before serving. Enjoy hot or cold.</p>
