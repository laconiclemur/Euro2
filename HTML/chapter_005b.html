<h2 class="h2b">TARTE AUX PECHES</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Peach Tart</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>This is an upside-down tart in the way of the</em> tatin. <em>If you don’t have a shallow pan of 20cm (8in) in diameter, you could make slightly more caramel and pour it into a tart tin</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 6</span><br/>
5 large, slightly under-ripe peaches (buy 7 just in case)<br/>
50g (1¾ oz) unsalted butter<br/>
100g (3½ oz) caster sugar<br/>
1 disc puff pastry, 24cm diameter × 1cm (9½ in × ½ in) thick</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 180°C/350°F/Gas 4.</p>
<p class="normala">First get a bowl of water ready, just large enough to sit the bottom of a 20cm (8in), heat- and ovenproof pan in. In this pan, melt the butter and caster sugar together. Cook this, stirring frequently, until you have a dark caramel. Don’t worry if it looks like it has separated; once the peaches are in it will be fine. Being very careful, as it may spit, put the base of the pan immediately into the cold water to stop the caramel from cooking.</p>
<p class="normala">Cut the peaches in half and remove the stones. Cut eight of the halves in half again. Then, once the caramel has cooled, lay the quarters around the outside of the pan to make a circle. Put the two halves, one on top of each other in the centre and push down well. The fruit should be as tightly packed as possible so, if you can, add a little more. Cook over a gentle heat until the peaches begin to caramelise lightly.</p>
<p class="normala">Cover with the pastry disc, tucking it in around the inside edges. Bake for 20–25 minutes in the preheated oven until the pastry is dark brown and dry. Remove the tart from the oven and leave to cool down.</p>
<p class="normala">When cold, place the pan over a high heat to melt the caramel and, using the whole of your hand, twist the tart around the pan. Put a plate over the top and turn it upside down. If you want to reheat it, slice into portions while cold (this is much easier than hot) and reheat for about 10 minutes in a warm oven. Serve with some cinnamon ice-cream or a good dollop of crème fraîche.</p>
