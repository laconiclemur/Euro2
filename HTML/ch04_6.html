<p class="noindenti"><span class="stickup">M</span>y parents were never big on eggs for breakfast. Both of their families typically prepared egg-based dishes for lunch or light suppers, particularly on Friday evenings when abstaining from meat. But the frittata was always one of my favorite dishes.</p>
<p class="indenti">To prepare for <span class="txit">Big Night,</span> I worked with Gianni in the kitchen at Le Madri, and the first thing I asked to be taught was how to cook a frittata. After a few attempts ended up on the kitchen floor, I started to get the hang of it. Somehow, however, I seldom seem to accomplish this culinary feat with the ease that I did when the camera was rolling. The scene was filmed in a five-and-a-half-minute-long master shot, with no coverage (therefore there could be no cutaways), so I knew I must perform this task perfectly. I had found that a very high heat was the key to success with a frittata. We did seven takes, two of which were aborted halfway through—but not because of the cooking, which luckily was successful every time. It is because of this scene that people believe I can really cook. If they only knew!</p>
