  <p class="noindent">It has been such an incredible journey to make this book! A huge thank you to my colleague and partner in crime, Benny Cederberg, and to the very talented photographer, Charlie Drevstam, for coming along on this journey. We had such a wonderful time taking all the photos for this book!</p>

  <p class="indent">Thank you to the beautiful Stina Wirsén, who in her very unique way framed this book so beautifully with her drawings. I am awed.</p>

  <p class="indent">Also, a great big thank you to my Swedish publisher, Bonnier Fakta, for its wonderful staff with the capability and patience to understand the thought processes of an author with a chaotic mind. Big hug to Lisa Ydring, Anna Paljak, and Annika Lyth.</p>

  <p class="indent">And thank you Bibbi Ringqvist. You and Benny are my anchors. I’m so happy that I have you. It’s because of you that I stay grounded.</p>

  <p class="indent">And last but not least, a great big thanks to our sweet assistant, Marysia Klim. Without you, we would simply have too many cookies in the fridge!</p>
