<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bi">In Sicily and southern Italy, there is what they call</span> cucina povera, the “poor food” of the peasantry, and the <span class="italic">cucina nobile</span> of the nobility—an incredibly over-the-top style that you encounter today in banqueting rooms, at wedding parties, or on saints’ days. Feasting there is a matter of keeping up appearances, <span class="italic">la bella figura,</span> and gastronomic extravagance can reach incredible heights. They call it <span class="italic">spagnolismo</span> and say that it is a legacy of Spanish rule. So I was expecting to find an equally grandiose haute cuisine in Spain, a land that once had the greatest number of nobles in the world, and that once reveled in ceremony and stately court etiquette. But all the people I asked about a noble aristocratic cuisine said there never was such a thing, that today’s creative <span class="italic">nueva cocina</span> from star chefs is the first Spanish haute cuisine.</p>
<p class="para">Up until the beginning of the twentieth century, the high aristocracy, the royal entourage at the Madrid court, had French cooks and ate mainly French food. They gave ostentatious banquets, serving many dishes buffet-style, in the French manner. But the vast number of landed nobility who lived in the countryside did not have sophisticated tastes. They simply ate a lot of meat, while their retainers who worked the land ate foods based on bread, legumes, and vegetables. The aristocratic culture of Spain was a culture of war. It was sober and austere. The Reconquista of the Middle Ages had created a social class whose raison d’être was war. For much of its history, Spain, and in particular Castile, was a society constantly at arms, and the nobility was a fighting class. After the Muslims were finally vanquished, its armies fought converted Moriscos hiding in the mountains; they fought to take and to keep colonies across the sea; they fought in the Netherlands; they fought against England and France, and in Italy, Tunisia, and Algeria; they fought against Protestant heretics; and they fought at sea against the Turks and North African pirates. They also fought at home in the War of the Spanish Succession over being ruled by a Habsburg or Bourbon dynasty, when the Habsburg king Charles II died childless, having bequeathed his possessions to the grandson of his half sister and King Louis XIV of France.</p>

<p class="para">The nobility of the Christian states was in part descended from the aristocrats of the Visigoth era and in part brought into being by their services to the sovereign. Private armies were recruited and maintained by nobles to serve the king. In recompense, the king gave the nobles immense domains, including entire villages, expropriated from the Muslims. The high nobility of grandees, the <span class="italic">grandes de España,</span> formed an exclusive caste at the top of a strict aristocratic hierarchy. Then came the <span class="italic">titulos:</span> dukes, marquises, and counts. When the king needed financial help, he named more <span class="italic">titulos</span> and distributed more land in return for money. A lower nobility of <span class="italic">caballeros</span> and <span class="italic">hidalgos</span> was distinguished from the plebeian population, the <span class="italic">pecheros,</span> by the title of “Don.” Among them were soldiers who had fought valiantly and been knighted, and younger sons of nobles who had not inherited land but who served the crown in the hope of obtaining favors and property. City burghers wealthy enough to maintain horses and fight as knights also entered the ranks of the lower nobility. Small armies of these <span class="italic">caballeros</span> and <span class="italic">hidalgos</span> followed the kings and the great lords in battle. They were given small estates and sent off to fight on far-flung fronts and to conquer the New World. As the grandees and <span class="italic">titulos</span> kept buying up estates that brought them rents and profits, they came to control most of the land in the country. Some of the grand old families are still in possession of their ancestral estates and palaces. Some have wineries and produce olive oil. You will find their coats of arms on their <span class="italic">bodegas</span> (wineries).</p>
<p class="para">Each kingdom had its own capital. Ferdinand and Isabella moved their courts from one town to another in different regions. Spain got its first capital in 1561, when the Habsburg king Philip II chose Madrid to be his residence, the seat of government, and the center of Spain’s empire. When the royal palace at El Escorial was completed in 1584, the higher aristocracy of Castile and some of Aragon flocked to Madrid in search of royal favors and the pleasures of the court but kept their estates in the countryside. The lifestyle of the nobility was expensive, with large households and numerous retainers to sustain. Their residences were luxurious, with Flemish tapestries and family portraits on their walls. Their clothing was lavish, in satin and velvet, and silk brocade woven with threads of gold and silver. Thoroughbred horses and carriages were status symbols. There were theaters and fiestas and bullfights to attend, and huge amounts of money had to be set aside for dowries. Aristocrats were exempted from paying taxes, but they were expected to give the king money when he needed it for his wars and to supply armed soldiers for his armies. Serving the king could bring the grandees close to bankruptcy. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the nobility was in ongoing financial difficulty. For a time, however, they benefited from the silver and gold from the Americas and from the market for Spanish products in the Americas until other countries took over the trade with the New World.</p>
<p class="para">In Castile and Aragon especially, the countryside was in the hands of noble warlords who owned land and controlled the rural economy and had the allegiance of thousands of peasants. Depending on where they had their estates, the great landowners produced and marketed grain, olive oil, or wine; some produced cork. Others drew income from mills or from hunting preserves, or they bred bulls for the <span class="italic">corrida.</span> Wool was Spain’s main nonagricultural industry, and sheep farming was mostly in the hands of the nobility. Part of the motivation for regaining land from the Muslims was access to warmer winter grazing lands for the big flocks on the vast high central plateau that is noted for its long cold winters. As owners of fields, roads, and villages, the nobility also lived on rents and dues paid by peasants, sometimes under a sharecropping contract.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="img" src="images/p064.png" class="calibre10"/></p>
<p class="para">The nobles ate so much meat that many suffered from gout. Eating a large amount of meat was a sign of status, and suckling pig, baby lamb, and veal were favorite foods. They also ate chickens, capons, turkeys, geese, guinea hens, and rabbits. They loved to hunt, and game was plentiful in the wilderness that belonged to them. Deer, wild boar, hares, and game birds such as partridge, pheasant, woodcock, pigeon, and wild duck, and migrating quail, were an important part of their diet. Apart from suckling pig, pork was eaten mostly in the form of cured meat. Away from the sea, they ate hardly any fish apart from salt cod and occasionally the grander freshwater fish such as salmon, eel, and trout. They shunned vegetables, which were considered poor food, but consumed plenty of fruit—pears, apples, figs, cherries, and oranges—and almonds and other nuts. They enjoyed pastries and confectionery, which they received as gifts from the convents they supported financially, and they drank wine and hot chocolate.</p>
<p class="para">The very high nobility enjoyed French <span class="italic">haute cuisine,</span> but in general, the food eaten by the noble classes was simply cooked. They marinated game to tenderize the meat and cooked it in wine and brandy. Aromatics included garlic, saffron, cinnamon, cloves, bay leaves, oregano, and parsley. Condiments were oil, vinegar, mustard, and honey. Over the centuries, the large number of lesser nobility was mostly poverty-stricken. Unemployed in peacetime, they lived above their means, trying to keep up the high standards required of nobility without soiling their hands and losing status and honor by doing work or trade of any kind. Their situation is humorously depicted in one of the first picaresque novels, <span class="italic">La Vida de Lazarillo de Tormes,</span> published in 1554 by an unknown author and described as an autobiographical <span class="italic">novela de la hambre</span> (novella of hunger). It is the story of Lazarillo, a young lad who lives by his wits and serves many masters. In one chapter, his master is a proud impoverished nobleman who is starving but does not want the world to know. Rather than lose honor, he goes around town picking his teeth so that people will think he has just eaten meat. Not only is the nobleman not able to feed his servant, but the servant has to find ways to feed the master, for whom he has developed an affectionate respect.</p>
<p class="para">The <span class="italic">hidalgos</span> who hung around the royal court in Madrid were held in popular ridicule for “speaking loudly of their honor while having scarcely a ducat to their names.” “On the hidalgo’s table,” it was said, “there is much linen but little food.” In certain circles, the table settings and adornments were more significant in establishing social distinction than was the quality of the food. This was the world satirized by Cervantes in <span class="italic">Don Quixote,</span> where serving king and Church was the ideal, and the prevailing ethos was one of chivalry, bravado, honor, and the love that conquers all. While Sancho Panza (<span class="italic">panza</span> means “belly”) was always thinking about where he would get his next meal, Don Quixote gave food little thought and often managed to drag poor Sancho away from the table before he had finished eating, to set off on another mad adventure.</p>
