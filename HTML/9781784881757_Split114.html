<h1 class="chapter">calf’s liver with butter &amp; sage</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>Did you know that calf’s liver contains more vitamin C weight for weight than an apple? Nor did I. Calf’s liver is a superfood, as it contains more nutrients (particularly if it’s grass-fed) than most other foods, and we should be eating more of it. At our restaurants, calf’s liver is the biggest-selling dish on our menu; I believe one of the reasons for this is that people don’t like to cook it at home. Not wishing to diminish our sales, here is Giancarlo’s tried and tested way to cook it to perfection.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 4 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>4 pieces calf’s liver (each approx. 200 g/7 oz)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt and freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>plain (all-purpose) flour, for dredging</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>4 tablespoons olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>4 garlic cloves, peeled</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>75 g (2½ oz) salted butter, at room temperature</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>8 large fresh sage leaves</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Season the liver pieces on both sides with salt and pepper. Put some flour onto a plate and coat each piece of liver in flour on both sides. Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat, add the garlic cloves and fry for 1 minute. Increase the heat to high and add the floured liver pieces to the pan. Fry for 30 seconds on each side for medium-cooked liver or about 45 seconds on each side for well-done. If your pan isn’t big enough, fry the liver in batches. Turn the heat down, add the butter and sage leaves to the pan, and continue cooking the liver until the butter has melted. Serve immediately, dressed with the butter, sage and garlic.</p>
