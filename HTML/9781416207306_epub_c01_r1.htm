<p class="nonindent0">Tiny munchy little nibbles, para picar are light and tempting. The whole idea being that these little treats can be plucked from a dish with the fingers or skewed on a cocktail stick. No cutlery is ever needed.</p>

<p class="nonindent">This is such an easy way to jazz up olives — the most familiar of tapas nibbles. Once marinated, the aromatic spices and herbs marry perfectly with the firm salty olives, creating an elegant little dish that will have you reaching for more.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1/2 tsp. cumin seeds</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 tsp. fennel seeds</p>
<p class="hanging">5 dried chiles (pequín variety, if possible)</p>
<p class="hanging">3 cloves garlic, peeled and left whole</p>
<p class="hanging">1 lemon, sliced</p>
<p class="hanging">1 large sprig fresh rosemary</p>
<p class="hanging">1 (12–oz.) jar Spanish unstuffed green, black, or mixed olives in brine or olive oil, drained</p>
<p class="hanging02">1/3 cup really good Spanish extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="nonindent">Place the cumin and fennel seeds and chiles in a small skillet and toast over low heat for 1 minute or until they start to become aromatic. Put them into a mixing bowl along with all the other ingredients. Mix well, then transfer into a large lidded jar and let marinate in the refrigerator for 1–2 days before serving. These must be eaten within 2 weeks.</p>

<p class="nonindent">This is a delightful crunchy concoction of nuts and seeds to graze on alongside a glass of wine. If you have concerns about nut allergies, replace the almonds with extra pumpkin and sunflower seeds.</p>
<p class="hanging01">2 cups whole almonds, with skin</p>
<p class="hanging">1/3 cup pumpkin seeds</p>
<p class="hanging">1/3 cup sunflower seeds</p>

<p class="nonindent">Preheat the oven to 350°F. Mix all the ingredients together in a bowl. Transfer to a large roasting pan. Cook for 20–25 minutes, turning at regular intervals until the almonds are deep gold. Drain on paper towels and add a little more salt if desired. Serve warm.</p>

<p class="nonindent">This is the absolute cornerstone of tapas, a simple but vital centerpiece. It can be easily presented on a wooden board (olive wood is wonderful) at the center of the table and you’ll be fighting everyone off to get to it.</p>
<p class="hanging01">8 slices dried chorizo</p>
<p class="hanging">8 slices Serrano ham</p>
<p class="hanging">8 slices Spanish ham</p>
<p class="hanging">8 slices Spanish air-dried sausage</p>

<p class="nonindent">Marinating cheese might seem odd, but smooth manchego is complemented deliciously by the piquant cumin and peppers.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1 tsp. cumin seeds</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging">12 slices Spanish manchego cheese</p>
<p class="hanging02">1 cup roasted red peppers (jarred, if desired), cut into strips</p>
<p class="nonindent">Heat a small dry skillet and toast the cumin seeds for 30 seconds or until they become aromatic. Whisk the seeds into the olive oil with some salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="extract">Arrange the cheese slices in an airtight storage container. Pour in the cumin dressing and sprinkle with the pepper strips. Toss to mingle all the ingredients, then refrigerate overnight. Let stand at room temperature for 1 hour before serving in a deep bowl with all the marinade.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Boquerones are tiny butterflied anchovies, in a very acidic marinade that serves to cure the fish as well as add flavor. This recipe can only be done with fresh fish, so the smallest sardines will do if anchovies are not available.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1 1/3 cups fresh anchovies or small sardines, 4–5 inches long, preferably from Spain</p>
<p class="hanging">1 tsp. sea salt</p>
<p class="hanging">3/4 cup white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. fresh lemon juice</p>
<p class="hanging">3 cloves garlic, crushed</p>
<p class="hanging02">1/2 small bunch fresh parsley, finely chopped</p>
<p class="nonindent">Using your fingers, butterfly the anchovies. Run your finger along the backbone, separating the flesh from the bone as your finger gently slides down to the tail. Then lift out the bones in one piece. Starting with the head, you simply peel the bone away from the flesh — backbone, tail, and all. You are left with a whole, clean, butterflied fillet.</p>
<p class="extract">Place the anchovies in an airtight container, skin-side down, and sprinkle them lightly with sea salt. You may need to do this in layers.</p>
<p class="extract">Mix the vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, and parsley. Pour the mixture over the fillets. Give the container a shake to cover all the fish with the marinade. Cover the container and refrigerate for 2 days. The fish will marinate and turn white.</p>
<p class="extract">Serve piled on a board or plate with a trickle of the marinating liquid.</p>

<p class="nonindent">This is an elementary tapas dish, served with lashings of olive oil and salt in every good tapas bar. To the eye, these small smoky peppers all appear the same, but eating them is a game of gastronomic Russian roulette, as around one in every nine is fiery hot. So dive in with a cool drink in hand in case you happen to pick a feisty one.</p>
<p class="hanging01">1 1/2 cups Spanish green peppers (preferably pimientos de Padrón)</p>
<p class="hanging">2 tbsp. light olive oil</p>
<p class="hanging02">1/2 tsp. sea salt</p>
<p class="nonindent">Wash the peppers thoroughly in cold water and pat dry. Place a large lidded skillet over high heat, add the olive oil, and heat until almost smoking.</p>
<p class="extract">Add the peppers, cover, and cook for 4–5 minutes, turning occasionally, until blistered and slightly charred. Drain the peppers on paper towels, sprinkle generously with the sea salt, and serve.</p>

<h2 class="section"><a id="page28"/>fried chorizo &amp; potatoes</h2>

<p class="nonindent">This crunchy dish is an exciting take on potato chips. Chorizo is an unusual sausage, as it turns deliciously crispy when fried. Just be sure to fry the potatoes first; otherwise, the oils and spices released by the chorizo will stain the potatoes red.</p>
<p class="hanging01">vegetable oil for deep-frying</p>
<p class="hanging">1 large red-skinned potato, peeled and really thinly sliced</p>
<p class="hanging">2 raw chorizo sausages, sliced thin</p>
<p class="hanging02">1/2 tsp. sea salt</p>
<p class="nonindent">Fill a deep saucepan to half full with vegetable oil and heat to 350°F. In the hot oil, fry the potato slices in batches for 1–2 minutes until golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Repeat with the slices of chorizo, allowing the slices to turn golden and become crisp. Drain on paper towels. Sprinkle the potatoes and the chorizo with salt and serve immediately.</p>

<h2 class="section"><a id="page30"/>salt cod-stuffed piquillo peppers</h2>

<p class="nonindent">Punchy and piquant, piquillo peppers are a regular feature in Spanish cooking. These scarlet beauties are often found pickled or canned, which makes them a fantastic item to keep in your pantry. When stuffing the peppers, handle them with the utmost care as the skins tear easily, which will ruin their ability to contain the salt cod mixture.</p>
<p class="hanging01">3/4 cup dry salt cod</p>
<p class="hanging">1 bay leaf</p>
<p class="hanging">1 potato, a floury variety such as russet, peeled, boiled, and mashed</p>
<p class="hanging">2 cloves garlic, crushed and finely chopped</p>
<p class="hanging">zest and juice of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="hanging">1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for greasing and drizzling</p>
<p class="hanging">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="hanging02">4 jarred piquillo peppers (or any other whole red peppers in a jar)</p>
<p class="nonindent">Soak the salt cod in cold water 24 hours in advance, changing the water halfway through.</p>
<p class="extract">Preheat oven to 350°F. Place the soaked salt cod in a large pan with cold, fresh water to cover, add the bay leaf, and bring just to the boiling point. Remove pan from heat, set aside, and rest for 5–10 minutes. Remove salt cod from the pan and let cool. When the fish is cool enough to handle, remove any skin or bones and flake the flesh. In a large bowl, mix the fish, potatoes, garlic, and lemon zest and juice together, mashing vigorously with a fork. Add oil bit by bit, slowly beating it into the mixture until absorbed. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper. Fill the peppers with the fish mixture, taking care not to tear the flesh. Place the filled peppers in a lightly oiled baking pan and bake for about 20 minutes, until filling is heated through. Drizzle with olive oil and serve immediately.</p>
