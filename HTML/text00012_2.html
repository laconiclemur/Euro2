 pane</h2>
<h2 class="h2a">bread</h2>
<p class="parab1">In Italy bread forms the basis of every meal. In fact, Italians hold bread in such high esteem that when we want to say that someone is a good person we say they are like a piece of bread (<em>è come un pezzo di pane</em>
 ).</p>
<p class="parab1">At home, my father did most of the cooking but my mother baked the bread. She could easily have bought it but she insisted on making her own. I felt she was showing us how much she loved us through her baking. She put her heart and soul into it and filled the bread with her happiness as she prepared it for us to eat.</p>
<p class="parab1">Mamma used a wood-fired oven. She always baked bread on a Thursday and there was a certain purposeful excitement in the way she lit the oven the night before. She cooked the loaves slowly so they would stay fresh all week. In the morning, she would be up at five to stoke the fire. I would hear the crackling of the burning twigs. The smell would slowly waft through the house and infiltrate my dreams. I would wake up hungry, jump out of bed and run into the smoke-filled kitchen. There I would find three or four beautiful, warm, massive round loaves on the table. The smell was irresistible and it took all my willpower not to grab the bread and tear it apart.</p>
<p class="parab1">When I make bread now, I put a little bit of my soul into it. Baking bread is the most wonderful part of the working day for me. Early every morning at the restaurant, I spend a couple of hours making the bread for that day. I walk into the cold, empty kitchen before the rest of the world is up. The first thing I do is switch on the oven. Then I take the yeast out of the fridge. To me, it is a living thing to be cared for. It is cold and I can hear it crying out to be fed, so I give it its breakfast. I add the flour, then the water, and watch the big bubbles explode as I mix it together. It gives me such pleasure to watch. Then I leave the dough to rise.</p>
<p class="parab1"><a id="page_170"></a>
 Once it has risen, I take some of the dough and ask it what shape it would like to be today. I tease it into long rolls, round rolls, <em>filone</em>
 , <em>filoncino</em>
 , large <em>campagnia</em>
 loaves – so many gorgeous, voluptuous shapes. The focaccia and filled rolls are made last. I always find something delicious to top my focaccia. Sun-dried tomatoes, olives, onions and rosemary are favourites. For my rolls I choose the freshest seasonal fillings – such as grilled vegetables, wild garlic, pesto – or mixed cheese and salami.</p>
<p class="parab1">While the bread is in the oven, I leave the kitchen and go out on to the street for some fresh air. The moment I go back downstairs is magical. The smell of bread baking never fails to overwhelm me with sweet, nostalgic memories of my childhood.</p>
<p class="parab1">It may sound crazy but if I bake in the afternoon the bread is never as good. Maybe it is because the ingredients are living things. I think the dough knows from the way I handle it if I’m miserable. In the afternoons I am too tired to put the amount of love into the mixing that I do in the mornings. If I’m happy and energetic, the bread always tastes much better.</p>
<p class="parab1">The Greek word for bread translates literally as everything. I couldn’t agree more. I believe bread gives you everything you need.</p>

 impasto di pane</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">basic bread dough</h3>
<p class="para1">I make most of my dough-based recipes from this basic dough. Bread may seem complicated and an effort to make, but I suggest you try it – there is no more appealing cooking smell than that of your own bread, and certainly no other bread can match the taste. You will find that this bread keeps for days without going mouldy. After a day or so it might go hard, but place it in a hot oven for a few minutes and it will taste freshly made again.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>makes 2 loaves</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">1kg/2lb 3oz strong bread flour, plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="ingre">20g/¾oz salt</p>
<p class="ingre">25g/1oz fresh yeast</p>
<p class="ingre">700ml/24fl oz lukewarm water</p>
<p class="ingre1">semolina, coarse polenta or dried breadcrumbs for sprinkling</p>
<p class="para1">In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt together. Dissolve the yeast in the lukewarm water and pour into the flour. Mix well until you obtain a soft but not sticky dough. Turn out on to a lightly floured work surface and knead well for about 5 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Place the dough on a clean kitchen cloth, brush the top with some water to prevent it drying out, then cover with another clean cloth. Leave to rise in a warm place for about 30 minutes or until doubled in size. Knock the risen dough back down and shape it into 2 round loaves. Place on a baking sheet sprinkled with semolina or breadcrumbs, cover with a cloth and leave in a warm place again until doubled in size. Preheat the oven to 240°C/475°F/Gas Mark 9.</p>
<p class="para1">Place the loaves on the bottom shelf of the oven and bake for 25 minutes. The way to test if a loaf is ready is to tap it gently on the bottom: if it sounds hollow, it is ready. Remove from the oven and leave to cool. This bread is delicious eaten on the day it is baked. It will keep for about a week and is great sliced and used for <a href="text00011.html#page_155">bruschetta or crostini</a>
 , toast or breadcrumbs.</p>
<p class="para1">
<strong>Breadcrumbs</strong>
 Place some sliced stale bread on a baking tray and bake in the oven at 120°C/250°F/Gas Mark ½ for about an hour to dry out completely. Remove from the oven and whiz in a food processor. Store in an airtight container.</p>

 <span class="big">‘</span>
 As a child, I was like one of the Bisto kids when bread was being made. The smell was so enticing. There is nothing like it.</p>
<p class="paraba1">I loved having bread in the morning. My mother often made me something called a <em>scodella</em>
 from any leftovers. This delicious treat was simply a bowl of bread with milk, sugar and cinnamon. It was like nectar to a hungry boy.</p>
<p class="paraba1">Every day, we children were packed off with a generous wedge of bread. We would all meet up and search the orchards for ripe fruit to eat with it. My favourite was figs. When they were ready, I found fig trees, climbed to the top with my loaf and gorged on the ripe fruit. The problem with having a passion for figs was that I was nearly always caught out. The trees gave off milk, which made me sticky and scratchy. It was very difficult to remove – even though I jumped straight into the sea afterwards to try to wash it off.</p>
<p class="paraba1">When the bread was fresh and warm, my little friends and I headed for the village <em>pasticceria</em>
 to have scoops of chocolate ice cream to put into the middle. The result was an inspiration. The memory of the ice cream melting into the warm dough still makes my mouth water.</p>
<p class="paraba1">I was always threatened with a prison diet of bread and water when I misbehaved as a child. It was never much of a deterrent, though, because I loved bread so much that I actually looked forward to the punishment!<span class="big1">’</span>

 pane rustico</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">bread with salami, cheese and eggs</h3>
<p class="para1">This has to be one of my favourite types of bread. It was traditionally made by farmers’ wives as a filling lunch for their husbands while working in the fields, using up all their leftovers of ham, salami, cheese and even pork fat (scratchings). I make this bread at Easter time, as the eggs, which are placed around the ring, make it look very pretty and seasonal for Easter Sunday breakfast.</p>
<p class="para1">Make sure the eggs are at room temperature, as if they are cold they interfere with the rising of the dough. The eggs are cooked in their shells – securing them with strips of dough prevents them exploding in the oven. The eggs come out perfectly cooked and make a delicious addition to this substantial loaf.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>makes 1 large ring</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">100g/4oz salami, cut into small cubes</p>
<p class="ingre">100g/4oz pancetta, cut into small cubes</p>
<p class="ingre">100g/4oz prosciutto, cut into small cubes</p>
<p class="ingre">100g/4oz provolone cheese, cut into small cubes</p>
<p class="ingre">100g/4oz Pecorino cheese, cut into small cubes</p>
<p class="ingre">100g/4oz Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</p>
<p class="ingre">2 tbsp coarsely ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingre">600g/1lb 5oz strong bread flour, plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="ingre">1 tsp salt</p>
<p class="ingre">25g/1oz fresh yeast</p>
<p class="ingre">450ml/¾ pint lukewarm water</p>
<p class="ingre">semolina or dried breadcrumbs for sprinkling</p>
<p class="ingre1">6 eggs, in their shells</p>
<p class="para1">Place all the meat and cheese in a bowl with the pepper, mix well and set aside.</p>
<p class="para1">Mix the flour and salt together in a large bowl. Dissolve the yeast in the lukewarm water and add to the flour. Mix with your hands, gradually incorporating all the flour to form a soft, slightly sticky dough. Turn out on to a floured work surface and knead for about 3 minutes or until smooth, adding more flour to the work surface if necessary. Break off a piece of dough about the size of a tennis ball and set aside. Spread the remaining dough out into a rough circle and add the meat and cheese mixture, kneading it into the dough until evenly combined. Continue to knead for a couple of minutes, then roll the dough into a large sausage shape about 65cm/26in long and seal the ends to form a ring.</p>
<p class="para1">Sprinkle some semolina or breadcrumbs on a large, flat baking tray and place the ring on it. Make 6 deep incisions around the top of the ring with a sharp knife and with your fingers enlarge each one to make a pocket. Place an egg lying flat in each pocket.</p>
<p class="para1">Take the reserved piece of dough, roll it out into a rough square and cut out 12 strips approximately 7.5cm/3in long. Place 2 strips criss-cross over each egg, brushing them with a little water so they stick well. Cover the loaf with a clean cloth and leave in a warm place until doubled in size. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/Gas Mark 7.</p>
<p class="para1">Bake the loaf for 30 minutes or until golden. This is delicious served hot or cold.</p>

 focaccia con aglio e rosmarino</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">focaccia with garlic and rosemary</h3>
<p class="para1">I remember having focaccia as a child, although we did not know it by that name. We would flatten leftover bread dough and drizzle it with extra virgin olive oil and sea salt. This would often be my breakfast. When I became a chef, I discovered that this simple bread was commonly known as focaccia, and during my many travels over Italy I saw it being made in different ways with various toppings and even stuffed. I used to bring these ideas back to England with me and develop them further.</p>
<p class="para1">You can top focaccia with almost anything you like – cherry tomatoes, olives, grilled vegetables, herbs, but always with extra virgin olive oil and sea salt. In this basic recipe, I have given you just a few simple ingredients – garlic, rosemary, oil and sea salt – which together make a delicious topping. Focaccia is best served warm straight from the oven but if you make it in advance you can always reheat it in a hot oven for a few minutes just before serving. It makes an ideal accompaniment to meals instead of bread rolls, and can even be sliced in half and filled with some ham and cheese to make a substantial sandwich.</p>

<strong>makes 1 loaf<br/>
for the dough:</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">500g/17½oz strong bread flour</p>
<p class="ingre">2 tsp salt</p>
<p class="ingre">15g/½oz fresh yeast</p>
<p class="ingre">350ml/12fl oz lukewarm water</p>
<p class="ingre">semolina or coarse polenta for sprinkling</p>

<strong>for the topping:</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</p>
<p class="ingre">2 large garlic cloves, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">needles from 3 fresh rosemary sprigs, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">1 tsp flaky sea salt, preferably Maldon</p>
<p class="ingre1">freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="para1">Preheat the oven to 240°C/475°F/Gas Mark 9. Make the dough in the same way as the Basic <a href="text00012.html#page_172">Bread Dough</a>
 . You will need a baking tray about 37.5 x 27.5cm/15 x 11in. After the first rising, place the dough on a lightly floured work surface and roll out into a rectangular shape roughly the size of the baking tray. Warm the baking tray in the hot oven for about 10 seconds, then remove and sprinkle with semolina.</p>
<p class="para1">Place the rolled-out dough on the tray and pour the olive oil on to the dough. With your fingers, spread the oil all over the dough. Leave for 5 minutes, then poke the dough all over with your fingers to make indentations. Sprinkle the garlic and rosemary over the top, followed by the salt and pepper. Leave to rest in a warm place for 30 minutes (a good place is on the hob, if it is directly above the oven).</p>
<p class="para1">Bake for about 15 minutes, until evenly golden brown. Check the focaccia from time to time, as domestic ovens often colour one side and not the other, so turn the baking tray round accordingly. Once cooked, remove from the oven and immediately drizzle some olive oil all over. Leave to cool, then cut into squares.</p>
<p class="para1">This bread is delicious eaten on the day it is baked, but it will keep for a few days, and you can freshen it up in the oven for a few minutes just before serving.</p>

 schiacciata della vendemmia</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">sweet tart with harvest grapes</h3>
<p class="para1">At harvest time in Italy it is traditional to put aside some grapes to consume over Christmas. They become deliciously sweet and squashy and make a perfect filling for a pie. I am not suggesting you preserve grapes for this recipe, as nowadays you find them all year round. Use the sweet varieties, such as Muscatel. Don’t be alarmed by the large quantity of cinnamon – the taste is not at all overpowering.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4–6</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">20g/¾oz fresh yeast</p>
<p class="ingre">165ml/5½fl oz lukewarm water</p>
<p class="ingre">300g/10½oz strong bread flour, plus extra for dusting</p>
<p class="ingre">1 tsp salt</p>
<p class="ingre">dried breadcrumbs, coarse polenta or semolina for sprinkling</p>
<p class="ingre">450g/1lb white or black grapes</p>
<p class="ingre">5 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">65g/2½oz caster sugar</p>
<p class="ingre">1 tbsp ground cinnamon</p>
<p class="ingre">a bunch of fresh rosemary, plus a few sprigs to decorate</p>
<p class="ingre1">icing sugar for dusting</p>
<p class="para1">Dissolve the yeast in the lukewarm water and set aside. Sift the flour into a large bowl, mix in the salt and make a well in the centre. Gradually pour in the yeast mixture, mixing it with the flour to make a soft but not sticky dough. Turn out and knead on a lightly floured surface for about 10 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Divide the dough into 2 balls, cover with a clean kitchen cloth and leave to rest for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="para1">Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/Gas Mark 6. Roll out one of the balls of dough into a round about 2mm/<sup>1</sup>
 /<sub>12</sub>
 in thick and 15cm/6in in diameter. Sprinkle a large baking tray with breadcrumbs or semolina then lift the dough on to it. Set aside a small bunch of 8–10 grapes and arrange the rest over the dough, leaving a border of about 2.5cm/1in all around. Drizzle with 3 tablespoons of the olive oil, sprinkle over 50g/2oz of the sugar and all the cinnamon. Then sprinkle over the rosemary needles.</p>
<p class="para1">Roll out the other half of dough to the same size and place this over the filling, pressing down the edges well. Trim away any excess and crimp the edges with your fingers so that the pie is well sealed. Drizzle the remaining olive oil over the top and sprinkle with the remaining sugar. Place in the oven and bake for 10 minutes, then place the reserved grapes on top with a few sprigs of rosemary. Bake for a further 10 minutes until pale gold and lightly caramelised. Dust with icing sugar and serve warm.</p>
