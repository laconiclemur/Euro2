  <p class="nonindent"><a class="calibre8" id="page2"></a><span class="dropcaps"><img alt="" class="calibre11" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_007_r1.jpg" /></span>T<span class="small1">HE FIRST TIME I CAME TO THIS MAGNIFICENT REGION WAS IN 1969</span>. My son, Joseph, was just nine months old, and we were determined to get him—and later his sister, born in 1972—to the old country during the first years of their lives and every year thereafter, so that they could connect with their roots. We wanted them to absorb the tastes of the indigenous foods, the language and the music, and the ways of the Italian people.</p>

  <p class="indent">Trentino–Alto Adige is a region that is split into two provinces. Around the city of Trento, to the south, the language and the culture have long been Italian, whereas in Alto Adige, around the city of Bolzano, to the north, the region has absorbed the German culture.</p>

  <p class="indent">That year we had bought a Mercedes 220 diesel, and to save money we went to the factory in Stuttgart, Germany, to pick it up. It was a long drive back to Italy, up and down the Alps, and we crossed the border at the Brenner Pass. Today there is a tunnel, and easier routes, but for us then it was a real high-altitude experience, with snow in July. We headed toward Trento and then turned into the Val Sugana, one of the most beautiful valleys, surrounded by peaks. There are little towns scattered around the mountainsides, each with a steeple, around which are huddled beautiful wooden chalets with vibrant flowers cascading from their balconies.</p>

  <p class="indent">During that first trip, we stayed for a few days in the Val Sugana, at a small family-run inn where we had some of the most gratifying meals. The first night included Beef Rolls with Mustard and Vegetables, and Whole-Grain Spaetzle to mop up the sauce. To go along with this hearty fare, we had a pitcher of beer and some simple Baked Apples for dessert. By this time Joe had fallen asleep, and we carried him to our room, where the windows looked out onto the main street. Suddenly the sound of an oompah band exploded into the night. I felt transported to my childhood, and from our window we joined in the singing as Joe slept on.</p>

  <p class="indent">Throughout this mountainous region, the food is rustic and the people, weathered by the climate, are disciplined and efficient. Every bit of land is used, and when it yields its harvest, the abundance of flavors is doubly appreciated and the whole community gets together to celebrate. Nothing is wasted, and during the months of plenty the women are busy putting up horseradish <a class="calibre8" id="page3"></a>and other condiments and curing meats to be consumed by the hearthside during the cold months ahead.</p>

  <p class="indent">The lush pastures in the Asiago High Plateau, where cattle have been grazing since the Middle Ages, are responsible for the delicious cheese Asiago, which is also produced in the Veneto. Two kinds are made here in Trentino–Alto Adige: fresh Asiago, also known as <em class="calibre4">pressato</em>, made from whole milk that has been aged, and the mature Asiago d’Allevo, which is made from partially skimmed milk and then aged anywhere from three months to a year. The younger cheese is popular as a table cheese with fruit, especially apples, and slices of dark <em class="calibre4">Bauernbrot</em> and crispy rye flatbread. Young Asiago is also delicious tossed in a salad, including the Country Salad, whereas the Asiago d’Allevo, depending on how long it has aged, is used primarily for appetizers, grating on soups and pastas, and in stuffings.</p>

  <p class="indent">I and my children, now with their children, have returned to this region periodically over the years. In 2005, my friend Mario Piccozzi, with whom I often travel through Italy, invited me to visit his summer home in Merano to experience his favorite spots in Trentino–Alto Adige. Merano is a beautiful citadel situated on the Adige River, and we took long walks and admired the beautiful buildings adorned with decorative paintings. We also enjoyed some great hiking to the north of Merano and assuaged our appetites in Tirolo, the Tirol, where we had many a platter of sliced speck (smoked air-cured pork), deliciously sweet and smoky. We also had an unusual but delightful Cabbage Salad with Speck and oversized Dumplings with Speck—<em class="calibre4">Canederli di Speck</em>. In the north of Italy it is common to make gnocchi from stale bread, but the <em class="calibre4">canederli</em> are a much-magnified version, and particularly delicious when they are made with speck. Speck, used extensively in this cuisine, is boned pork ham, smoked and aged by artisans in the Venosta Valley. It looks like bacon and tastes like prosciutto, but has the added element of smoke.</p>

  <p class="indent">Heading south from Merano, bypassing Bolzano, we ended in the Val di Non, the apple epicenter of Italy. Apples have been a major product here since the Middle Ages. An 1856 nursery list, compiled by the guild of Bolzano farmers, listed 193 apple varieties that could be successfully grown here. Today there are more than eight thousand apple farmers in the region, and apple growing is one of the principal industries. Val di Non apples owe their superior qualities to the rich soil, to the magnesium-rich dolomite rock formations that are characteristic of the territory, as well as to the Val di Non’s temperate continental-Alpine climate. So it is natural that apples play an important part in the culinary tradition. From Celery Root and Apple <a class="calibre8" id="page4"></a><a class="calibre8" id="page5"></a>Salad—<em class="calibre4">Insalata di Mele</em> to Spaghetti in Tomato-Apple Sauce—<em class="calibre4">Spaghetti alle Mele</em> to Horseradish and Apple Salsa—<em class="calibre4">Salsa di Cren e Mele</em> and Chunky Apple-Apricot Bread Pudding—<em class="calibre4">Sformato di Mele</em>, it is not unusual to find apples in every course, as you will see in the recipes that follow.</p>

  <p class="center"><img alt="" class="calibre6" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_008_r1.jpg" /></p>

  <p class="figure1"><em class="calibre4">As we headed up the Val di Non valley, we encountered this husband and wife resting during a passeggiata in July 2007.</em></p>

  <p class="indent">The southwest part of Trentino–Alto Adige borders on Lake Garda. I particularly like the olive oil from this area. It is said that olives have been cultivated in the Garda since prehistoric times. The varietals planted today are Casaliva, Frantoio, Leccino, and Pendolino, which yield fruity and mellow buttery oils with scents of almonds. They are light green in color, with low acidity levels—sometimes half of other extra-virgin olive oils. It is the microclimate created by the lake and Alps behind that allows olives to grow at such high latitude. Although the traditional cuisine of Trentino–Alto Adige is based on animal fat, ever more olive oil is being used in cooking today.</p>

  <p class="indent">Because of the region’s hilly topography only 15 percent of its land is cultivable, and the difficulty of growing vines on steep terraced hillsides compels growers to emphasize quality. One would think that at such high altitude white would be the wine of choice, but over the years the emphasis has been on reds, such as Lagrein and Teroldego. Nevertheless, I particularly love the large perfumed and crisp whites of this terrain—Sylvaner, Veltliner, Gewüztraminer, and Müller Thurgau.</p>

  <p class="extract">Every region of Italy has a <em class="calibre4">fagioli</em> (bean) soup, often quite filling, with potatoes and pork and either pasta or rice. Interestingly, it was in Trentino–Alto Adige, renowned for the heartiness of its soups, that I had this unexpectedly light bean soup, cooked with fresh apples and delicately spiced. It is vegetarian (also unusual), nourishing, and quite scrumptious. The combination of apples and beans is marvelous, and one of the pleasing features of this recipe is that simply by using less water you can make a great bean-and-apple side dish, a perfect accompaniment to roast pork, duck, or ham.</p>

  <div class="block1">
    <p class="nonindent"><span class="small">RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT</span>: A 3-quart pot for cooking the beans; a heavy-bottomed saucepan, 4 quarts or larger, 10 inches wide, with a cover</p>
  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Drain the soaked beans, and put them in the pot with the bay leaf and fresh cold water to cover by an inch or so. Bring to a boil, lower the heat to keep the liquid simmering steadily, and cook, partially covered, about 40 minutes, or until the beans are cooked through but not mushy. Turn off the heat, stir in ½ teaspoon salt, and let the beans cool for a while in the pot, absorbing some of the cooking liquid.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the soup: Peel and core the apples, and cut them in ¼-inch-thick slices. Put 4 tablespoons of the butter in the heavy saucepan, and set it over medium heat. As soon as the butter melts, scatter the apple slices in the bottom and drop in the cloves.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Cook the apples for 3 minutes, or until they begin to soften, turning and stirring them gently. Drain the cooked beans, and add them to the pan, then pour in the hot water—all 8 cups if you’re making soup; 6 cups to make a side dish with thicker consistency. Turn up the heat, and stir in the lemon zest, cinnamon, and remaining 1½ teaspoons salt.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Cover the pan, bring the liquid to a boil, then set the cover ajar and lower the heat to keep the soup bubbling gently. Simmer 10 to 15 minutes, until the apples are completely soft and the liquid has the consistency you like for soup (or cook longer for a side dish). Turn off the heat, stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, and serve.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">You might be lost in the mountainous northern regions of Italy, but there would be one sure sign of your whereabouts: if you are served <em class="calibre4">canederli</em>, you are in Trentino–Alto Adige. Th ese traditional bread dumplings appear somewhere in almost every lunch or supper: they might be floating in a bowl of broth, or dressed like pasta and served as a first course, or as a starch alongside a braise or stew, or even as a dessert.</p>

  <p class="indent">Like many of the most enduring dishes in Italian cooking, <em class="calibre4">canederli</em> were born out of frugality, when the poor but clever women of generations past fashioned a tasty new dish from the chunks of old bread that they always saved. In Trentino–Alto Adige, the bread was soaked until soft, bound with flour, formed into balls, and cooked—but of course they would give it great flavor by adding something from the pantry: herbs or spices, cheese, or cured meat. And here <em class="calibre4">canederli</em> have become the essential starch dish used to mop up sauces, as pasta, polenta, and rice are in other locales.</p>

  <p class="indent">These two savory versions of <em class="calibre4">canederli</em>—and the sweet <em class="calibre4">Canederli di Ricotta</em> show the variety of ways they are prepared and enjoyed. Th e <em class="calibre4">canederli di speck</em> are most typical, made from a dough of reconstituted country bread, loaded with tidbits of speck, the lightly smoked ham so prized in Trentino–Alto Adige. The <em class="calibre4">canederli al cumino</em> are quite diff erent, made from a base of cooked potatoes and celery root, flavored with herbs and ground cumin, then fried to develop a crusty exterior, and finally baked. I know you will love both types of <em class="calibre4">canederli</em>, as I do.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="c01s01.02">D<span class="small1">UMPLINGS WITH</span> S<span class="small1">PECK</span></h2>

  <p class="nonindent1">Canederli di Speck <img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Makes about 14 <em class="calibre4">canederli</em>, serving 6 to 8</p>

  <p class="extract">Genuine imported speck is the meat of choice for these <em class="calibre4">canederli</em>, but you can substitute either thick-cut bacon or prosciutto—in particular, the fatty prosciutto from the end of the leg—and get excellent results. Or you may omit the meat entirely and still have quite satisfying <em class="calibre4">canederli.</em> Poached <em class="calibre4">canederli</em> are best served as soon as they are cooked, but you can cook them in advance, and reheat them in hot stock.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Cut the sliced speck (or bacon or prosciutto) into strips about ⅓ inch wide; chop the strips crosswise to form little square bits of meat.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour the olive oil into the smaller skillet, and set it over medium heat. Stir in the onion, and cook until it starts sizzling. Spoon a tablespoon or two of water into the pan (so the onions soften without coloring), and cook for 3 or 4 minutes more. Scatter in the chopped speck and cook for 2 or 3 minutes, until it has rendered its fat. Scrape the onion and speck into a large bowl and let cool.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Put the bread cubes in another bowl, and pour in the milk. Toss the cubes so they’re all drenched, then let them soak up the milk for about 10 minutes, until completely saturated. By handfuls, squeeze the bread, discarding the excess milk (or saving it for your cat!).</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Loosen the compressed bread, tearing it into shreds, and toss them into the bowl with the speck. Add the grated cheese, chives, parsley, and ½ teaspoon salt, and toss everything together. Pour the beaten eggs over the bread mixture, and stir to blend. Finally, sprinkle on ½ cup flour and stir it in to form a moist, sticky dough. Pick up a bit and form it into a ball: if it is too soft to keep a shape, stir in more flour, a tablespoon at a time.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Fill the wide pot with about 6 quarts water, and add 1 tablespoon salt; heat it to a boil. Melt the butter in the big skillet over very low heat; turn off the flame, but leave the skillet on the burner.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Spread ½ cup flour on the tray or baking sheet. With floured hands, scoop up a small portion of dough (a scant ¼ cup or so). Shape the dough into a 2-inch ball, tossing it from hand to hand and patting it lightly into a round—don’t press or squeeze it too much. Lay it in the flour, and roll the ball to coat it all over. Set it on one side of the tray, and form round dumplings from the rest of the dough the same way.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> With the poaching water at a steady boil, drop in the dumplings, one at a time but quickly. Handle them gently and don’t stir them. Bring the water back to a boil, then adjust it so it simmers steadily. Don’t let it boil vigorously, which can break apart the <em class="calibre4">canederli.</em></p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Let the dumplings cook, without stirring, until all have risen to the surface of the water. Simmer them for a couple of minutes, then scoop one out and cut into it to check that the center is not wet and the dough looks uniformly cooked through.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Meanwhile, have the big skillet with melted butter warming over very low heat. Lift the cooked dumplings with a spider, let drain over the pot for a few seconds, then gently drop them in the butter. Spoon butter over the <em class="calibre4">canederli</em> and serve them right away—on individual plates or a platter, family-style—topped with grated cheese.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> If you are serving them as an accompaniment to braised or roasted meat, drizzle the pan juices over the <em class="calibre4">canederli.</em> You can also arrange the buttered <em class="calibre4">canederli</em> around the meat on a platter, letting them slowly absorb the juices or sauce.</p>

Lower the heat a bit, and simmer the celery root for about 20 minutes; then drop in the potatoes (and raise the heat to bring the water back to the simmer). Cook the vegetables together just until they are cooked through and can be pierced easily with a skewer or sharp knife. Depending on size, the celery root needs 40 minutes to an hour, and the potatoes will take 20 to 30 minutes.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When done, remove the vegetables to a colander to drain and cool until you can handle and peel them. To peel celery root, scrape the skin off with the dull side of a paring knife, then cut out any bits of skin in the folds or any tough, knobby parts. Press the cooked, peeled vegetables through a ricer or food mill into a large mixing bowl, and blend them together.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> If the celery root is too fibrous to pass through a food ricer, cut it into chunks and drop them into a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Process until smooth, then blend with the potatoes. <em class="calibre4">Don’t</em> put the potatoes into the food processor, because it will make them gummy.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> While the root vegetables are simmering, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a small skillet over medium heat, stir in the onion, and cook until slightly softened, about 3 to 4 minutes. Turn off the heat and let cool.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Before mixing the dough, arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 400°.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When the celery root and potatoes are mashed and mixed, stir in the onion, chives, marjoram, cumin, salt, and pepper.

  <p class="extract">Savoy cabbage is typically served as a cooked vegetable, but here the raw cabbage, shaved into thin shreds, makes a wonderful salad with great, resilient texture. Crisp rendered strips of speck (or bacon or prosciutto as alternatives) are a great complement, and the hot vinegar dressing is delicious.</p>

  <p class="indent">For shredding the cabbage, I like to use a mandoline slicer. These versatile cutting implements were once quite costly and usually found only in professional kitchens. Today, though, you can buy a decent simple mandoline for under $20, and I recommend that every home cook have one.</p>

  <p class="extract">This is a terrific salad for your repertoire, especially in winter, when vegetable choices are limited (though I like it any time of year). It is tasty and versatile, good as a side dish for grilled chicken, lamb chops, or pork chops, and substantial enough to be a meal in itself. It doesn’t wilt and is excellent for a buffet table or picnic. Best of all, you can make and dress it ahead of time—in fact, it gets better if you do.</p>

  <p class="extract">Crunchy, flavorful, refreshing, nourishing, and colorful, this salad makes a fine meal by itself. Its assortment of vegetables, apples, nuts, and cheese should be fresh and well prepared. It is especially important to use a top-quality table cheese, because it is a major contributor of taste and texture. In Trentino–Alto Adige, this salad would always have a fresh local cheese, most likely an Asiago <em class="calibre4">pressato</em>, made with milk from farms in the province of Trento (and the neighboring Veneto region). Aged only 20 days, this young cheese has a sweetness and soft, chewy consistency that’s perfect in salad.</p>

  <p class="indent">If you can’t find genuine Italian Asiago, don’t buy the inferior cheeses called Asiago produced in other countries (including the United States). Choose instead Montasio—a favorite of mine from my home region, Friuli—similarly soft and sweet, though richer and more complex than Asiago. Cubes of fresh Grana Padano (which also is made in Trento) or even good American cheddar, younger and on the mild side, would be great here as well.</p>

  <p class="indent">You can dress this salad in advance and set it out on a buffet. In that case, though, I suggest you add the walnuts just before serving, so they remain crunchy.</p>

  <p class="extract">Here’s another fine winter salad, pairing one of my favorite, underappreciated vegetables—celery root—with fresh apples. The mellow, tender cubes of cooked celery root and the crisp apple slices provide a delightful, unexpected combination of flavor and texture. To turn the salad into a light lunch, add a few slices of prosciutto and serve it with some crusty bread.</p>

  <p class="indent">A firm, crisp apple is what you want for salad, and fortunately there are many varieties in the market that have that essential crunch, with flavors ranging from sweet to tangy to tart. I like to use a few different apples, rather than just one type, for greater complexity of flavor and vivid color in the salad. In addition to the reliably crisp Granny Smith apple, I look for some of the old-time firm and tart apples, such as Gravenstein, Jonathan, and Rome, and a few newer strains, like Cameo, Gala, and Fuji.</p>

  <p class="extract">I know you might do a double take at the name of this recipe. But I assure you it is a simple, delightful rendition of spaghetti in quickly cooked tomato sauce.

  <p class="extract">Spaetzle are little noodles or dumplings made by pressing a sticky dough through a perforated tool right into boiling water—one of the simplest of all the techniques by which pasta is made. These whole-wheat spaetzle are especially delicious, dressed simply with butter and grated cheese, and make a good alternative to potatoes as a <em class="calibre4">contorno</em> accompanying roasts or braised meats.</p>

  <p class="indent">The key to making spaetzle is having the right tool or utensil, with holes large enough to let the sticky dough pass through easily and quickly. You might have a colander that works, but I recommend that you buy a spaetzle-maker designed for the job. There are different kinds—some slide like a mandoline; others extrude the dough, like potato ricers—and both types are inexpensive and easy to use. And you’ll use your spaetzle-maker often, I am sure, after you make and taste a batch of <em class="calibre4">spätzle di farina integrale.</em></p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Whisk the eggs, milk, and salt together in a large bowl until thoroughly blended. With a wooden spoon, stir in the flour, parsley, and nutmeg, forming a thick, sticky, batterlike dough. If the dough is stiff, and doesn’t drip like a batter, work in more milk. Let the dough-batter rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil (at least 6 quarts water with 1 tablespoon salt). Fill the hopper of the spaetzle-maker with the batter, hold it over the pot, and press or slide it (depending on the type of tool), forcing the dough through the holes so it drops into the water in small blobs. If you don’t have a spaetzle-maker, scoop or pour the batter into the colander or perforated utensil and press it through the holes with a spatula.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Press all the batter into spaetzle, stirring occasionally so they don’t stick together or to the bottom.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> As the dumplings cook, melt the butter in the skillet over low heat. Scoop the cooked spaetzle out of the pot with a spider or large strainer, let drain for a moment, and spill them into the skillet. Still over low heat, toss the spaetzle to coat them all with butter and evaporate excess water. Turn off the heat, sprinkle the grated cheese on top, and toss again. Serve immediately.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">In Trentino–Alto Adige they brew good beer, which they enjoy by the steinful and use in cooking, too. Like wine, beer can be an important element in a dish, as I have found in the two dishes that follow. In the first, beer in the roasting pan contributes to a very tender roast chicken with a great crust. In the second, beer in the braising liquid deepens the flavor of a beef shoulder roast and its wonderful pan sauce.</p>

  <p class="indent">You will see that I leave open the choice of beer in both recipes. In testing for this book, I made the roast chicken several times with different beers and ales, including a golden lager, a mildly hopped pale ale, and a sweeter brown ale. My favorite so far is the pale ale. We braised the beef twice, with a golden lager and then an amber lager (both brewed in Brooklyn!), and each was delicious.</p>

  <p class="indent">Of course, you want to use a premium-quality, flavorful beer in these dishes. Fortunately, great beer is easy to find these days, with all the new artisanal microbreweries around the country. And keep in mind that the cooking process accentuates the flavor of the brew: the caramel maltiness of a dark lager will lend sweetness to the roast chicken; the bitterness of India pale ale will be imparted to the beef and braising sauce. I hope you’ll try these many times with different beers and let me know what you’ve discovered.</p>

  <p class="extract">Beef chuck, or shoulder, offers excellent cuts for stews and braises, because the meat is extremely tasty and, over long cooking, all the connective tissue adds flavor and body to the dish. For this braise (and the <em class="calibre4">Sugo alla Genovese</em>), I especially like the compact chunk of meat cut off the top of the shoulder blade, which is known by many names, including “top blade” or “top chuck shoulder” or “flatiron.” This piece is usually sliced and packaged as steaks, but ask your butcher to give you a whole top blade, as a roast. The more common beef chuck or shoulder roast, which comes from the underside of the shoulder, would be fine in this recipe, too. (It might be called “chuck pot roast” or “underblade chuck.”)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Starting at the short end of each scallop, pile three celery sticks, three carrot sticks, and a pickle in a bundle. Roll up the meat, enclosing the vegetables, and secure it with toothpicks. When all the rolls are formed, season with the remaining salt. Spread the flour on a plate, and dredge the <em class="calibre4">involtini</em>, lightly coating them.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour the olive oil in the pan, and set it over medium-high heat. Shake excess flour from the rolls, lay them in the pan in one layer, and cook, rotating and moving them around, until browned all over. Push the rolls to the side of the pan, and scatter the onion slices and any remaining carrot and celery sticks on the pan bottom. Drop in the bay leaves, and cook the vegetables, stirring occasionally, until they’re beginning to brown and soften, about 5 minutes.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Turn the heat to high, pour in the white wine, and let it heat and bubble until almost completely evaporated. Pour in just enough broth to cover the <em class="calibre4">involtini</em>, and bring it to a boil. Set the cover ajar, and adjust the heat to keep the liquid simmering. Cook for an hour and 15 minutes, or until the beef is tender and the sauce has reduced to a consistency you like.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Turn off the heat, take out the toothpicks, and remove the <em class="calibre4">involtini</em> to a warm platter. Ladle some of the pan sauce over the <em class="calibre4">involtini</em>, pour the rest into a bowl for passing at the table, and serve while hot.</p>

  <p class="extract">Baked apples are a favorite treat and comfort food in Trentino–Alto Adige as they are here. This recipe emphasizes the treat aspect, since the apples are draped with melted chocolate, chopped walnuts, and Amarena cherries. Many apple varieties are good bakers, including Cameo, Cortland, Empire, Jonagold, Northern Spy, and Rome. Granny Smith and Golden Delicious are always reliable, too.</p>

  <p class="extract">My friend Mario Piccozzi and I discovered this deluxe version of bread pudding on a winter visit to Merano, the historic resort town in the middle of the Alps, in Alto Adige. It was the perfect dessert on a cold day, served in its baking dish, still warm from the oven. Spooning the pudding onto plates, I was thrilled to find it loaded with apple chunks and walnuts, oozing rich custard and bubbling apricot jam. I make this at home now (it’s very easy) and serve it just as they do in Merano, family-style, setting the steaming, gold-topped pudding in the middle of the table, with a serving spoon and lots of plates. It disappears fast.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 350°. Coat the bottom and sides of the baking dish with the softened butter. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons of the sugar on the buttered surfaces; tilt and shake the pan so it’s sugared.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Stir together ¼ cup of the sugar with the cinnamon.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> For the custard: Whisk the eggs in a large bowl until thoroughly blended. Gradually pour in the cream, milk, and all the remaining sugar, whisking steadily to incorporate them, then whisk in the salt, vanilla, and lemon zest. Fold the bread cubes into the custard, pushing them down so they’re all submerged, and stir in the apple chunks.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Spoon the pudding into the baking dish, spread everything out to fill the dish in an even layer, and smooth the top. Drop teaspoonfuls of the apricot preserves on the pudding, distributing it all evenly, then scatter the chopped walnuts on top. Finally, sprinkle the cinnamon sugar over the pudding.</p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page25"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Put the pudding dish inside the roasting pan, and set the big pan in the oven.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Bake the pudding for an hour and 20 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and crusty and the custard is set: a knife blade inserted into the custard should come out clean. Carefully lift the roasting pan from the oven to a solid surface. Leave the pudding dish in the water bath to cool very gradually, but not too much—take it out of the water and serve the pudding family-style while it is still warm.</p>

  <p class="extract">Here’s a beautiful and special dessert: ivory <em class="calibre4">canederli</em>, sitting in a crimson pool of fresh strawberry sauce. Whereas the savory <em class="calibre4">Canederli al Cumino</em> are fried, these delicate morsels are poached and have a very light texture.

  <p class="indent">These are best when cooked just before you serve them (although the sauce can be made ahead), and in the recipe I give you a sequence of steps to streamline the procedure. Cook the strawberry sauce first, if you haven’t already, then proceed to make the <em class="calibre4">canederli.</em> Follow my instructions for poaching them—it’s important to cook them all the way through—and you’ll have perfect <em class="calibre4">canederli</em> in minutes.

  <div class="block1">
    <p class="nonindent"><span class="small">RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT</span>: A 3-quart saucepan; a wide pot, 8-quart capacity, for cooking the <em class="calibre4">canederli;</em> a heavy-bottomed skillet or sauté pan, 12-inch diameter or larger; a 2-ounce spring-loaded ice-cream scoop</p>
  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Put the cut strawberries in the saucepan (or cut them right into it), pour the sugar and lemon juice over, and toss together. Set the pan over medium-low heat; stir occasionally as the berries release juice and it gradually starts to bubble. Adjust the heat to keep the juice simmering, and cook for about 8 minutes, until the berries are soft and the juice is slightly syrupy. Turn off the heat, and cover the pot to keep the sauce warm.</p>

Put the butter in the big skillet and melt it over very low heat; turn off the flame, but leave the skillet on the warm burner.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> For the dough: Dump the ricotta into a large bowl, and stir to loosen it and break up lumps, then blend in the eggs and ¼ teaspoon salt. Sprinkle all the flour on top, and fold it in gently, just until it is all incorporated, with no small clumps of dry flour. The dough will be stiff and somewhat sticky.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Adjust the heat so the cooking water is bubbling gently. Fill a glass or jar with cold water to moisten the scoop, so the dough doesn’t stick. Dip the ice-cream scoop into the water glass, scoop up a round of dough, level it off (scraping excess back in the bowl), and dispense the dumpling into the cooking pot. Scoop up all the dough in the same way, and get the dumplings cooked as quickly as possible. If you don’t have an ice-cream scoop, use a ¼-cup measure. Empty each portion into your hand (both hands must be lightly floured!), and quickly roll it into a ball, then drop the dumpling into the pot.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> As you form the <em class="calibre4">canederli</em>, keep the scoop moistened (or your hands floured) and the water at a gentle simmer: don’t let it boil vigorously, which can break apart the <em class="calibre4">canederli.</em></p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> After all are in the pot, let the dumplings cook, without stirring, until all have risen to the surface of the water. Simmer them another 5 minutes, and then scoop one out and test it for doneness. First, press it gently: it should feel solid and spring back to the touch. If it feels soft at the center, return it to the pot and cook the batch a minute or two longer. Scoop out another dumpling, and cut into it to check that the center is not wet and oozing and that the dough looks uniformly cooked through.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Meanwhile, have the big skillet with melted butter warming over very low heat. Lift out the cooked dumplings with a spider, let them drain over the pot for a few seconds, then gently drop them in the skillet. Roll the dumplings gently so they’re coated all over with butter, then turn off the heat and leave them in the warm pan for a few minutes to firm up.</p>
