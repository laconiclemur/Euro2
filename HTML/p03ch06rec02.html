<p class="summary"><span class="italic">A journalist from the Catalan newspaper</span> La Vanguardia, <span class="italic">Lydia Larrey, called to ask me about pizza-type foods in Mediterranean countries. After we talked, I asked her to e-mail me her favorite</span> coca <span class="italic">recipe, and she sent me this one. It is from her native Majorca, where it is sold in pastry shops. The name comes from the local salad of diced tomatoes, green peppers, and onions, called</span> trempó, <span class="italic">which is used as the topping.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">The dough contains no yeast. After I had made it, I e-mailed Lydia, and she confirmed that it was as it should be, with the pastry very thin and crisp.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6 AS A STARTER</span></p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE TOPPING</span></p>
<p class="qun">4 medium tomatoes</p>
<p class="qun">1 medium onion</p>
<p class="qun">1 green bell pepper (in Majorca they use a light green pepper called <span class="italic">rubio</span>)</p>
<p class="qun">1 to 2 teaspoons sugar (optional)</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE DOUGH</span></p>
<p class="qun">½ cup olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup lukewarm water</p>
<p class="qun">½ teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="qun1">About 1¾ cups all-purpose flour, or as needed</p>
<p class="recsum">For the topping, cut the tomatoes, onion, and green pepper into small pieces. Put them in a bowl, season with a little sugar and some salt, and mix well. Let stand for 1 to 2 hours.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Meanwhile, for the dough, mix the olive oil, water, and salt very well in a bowl. Gradually stir in the flour, mixing with a fork and then with your hand; add just enough flour to form a smooth soft ball that does not stick to your fingers. Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Divide the dough in half. Spread each half into a round or rectangle on a large baking sheet, pressing it into a very thin layer with your fingers and the palm of your hand. Form a low rim around the edges of each one if you like. Bake for 10 minutes in a preheated 350°F oven to set the pastry.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Drain the topping thoroughly, so that the pastry does not get too soggy, and toss with the extra virgin olive oil. Cover the pastry entirely with the topping and bake for 45 to 60 minutes, until the pastry is crisp and the topping soft. If the topping starts to brown before the pastry is crisp, cover the <span class="italic">cocas</span> with foil.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Serve warm or at room temperature, cut into squares or wedges.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATIONS</span></p>
<p class="bl-first">• Add black olives or capers to the topping.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• For a <span class="italic">coca de pimiento,</span> with a red pepper topping, roast 5 red bell peppers (see page 128). Peel and seed them, and cut them into thin strips. Toss them with 2 crushed garlic cloves mixed with 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, 1 tablespoon vinegar, salt, and ½ teaspoon cumin.</p>
<p class="bl-last">• Instead of the oil-based pastry, you can use the dough from the <span class="italic">Coca de Recapte</span> on page 209. Use half the quantity, and roll it out very thin.</p>
