    <p class="nonindent">In the busy city of <strong class="calibre13">Reggio Calabria</strong>, look for the Bronzi di Riace at the National Museum. The piercing eyes of these ancient Greeks make you feel there is a soul within. These statues were found off the coast and are amazingly well preserved. Of great interest also is the sculpture bust of a <em class="calibre4">Philosopher of Porticello</em>, a rare example of Greek portraiture. The sculptor has captured his subject’s personality in stone. The cathedral in Gerace is the subject of a legend that gold was hidden inside the columns of the church. There have been thefts throughout the years, and it is said that people have even tried to steal the columns themselves.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Cirò</strong> is a town with many beaches and daytime activities. Carafa Castle is well restored, and you can bask in the sun on the Punta dell’Alice, an old Roman settlement with many artifacts, in particular the Saracen Markets, where a golden row of antique arches are reflected like honeycombs in the adjacent sea. A short distance outside the city are the ruins of a Greek temple dedicated to Apollo, and as you move away from the coast you’ll find the town of <strong class="calibre13">Crucoli</strong>, where lovely textiles are made and baskets are woven. Visiting Crucoli is really getting into the heart of Calabria.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Isola Capo Rizzuto</strong> is a charming town with a wonderful little island just off the coast that is connected to the mainland at low tide. You can wander through the meandering streets to reach the antique Castello.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Tropea</strong>, famous for its sweet red onions, also has one of Calabria’s best beaches—the Piazza Vittorio Veneto is the center of summer life in Tropea. The cafés are teeming with chic vacationers. Located in the center of town is the cathedral, which dates back to Norman times; of note, you’ll find the <em class="calibre4">Madonna del Popolo</em> in the Galluppi family chapel and the so-called Black Crucifix. A symbol of the town is the Church of Santa Maria dell’Isola, located on a rock that juts out into the sea. It is home to a Benedictine Sanctuary. This is a lovely place to bring a picnic lunch and admire the yellow stone church that is so beautiful against the glimmering blue sea.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Sibari</strong>, once the Greek town of Sybaris and known for great luxury, is worth a visit for its umbrella-pine-tree-lined, soft-sand shores. The immense archaeological site of ancient Sybaris provided many of the artifacts in the Sibartide National Archaeological Museum. Sibari is not far from the Pollini National Park, one of Italy’s more recently founded parks, established in 1993 to protect the Bosnian pines of the area. The dense nature of the area has sheltered the towns within, which maintain the ancient culture and language of the Albanian settlers who migrated here in the sixteenth century.—T<span class="small1">ANYA</span></p>
