<p class="image"><a id="page_12"/><a id="page_13"/><img alt="image" src="../images/01fig00.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_15"/>I have never thought of myself as someone who would thrive in extreme conditions—I am just too comfortable being comfortable—but driving sixty miles an hour across the vast icy expanses of Spitsbergen on a snow-mobile, completely covered, almost mummified, in multiple layers of wool undergarments and windproof winter wear, I feel like the king of the Arctic. I find myself imagining that I am a cowboy and my snowmobile is my horse. But then I remember that there is no need to use my imagination—the place where I am is really more dangerous and exotic than even the most faraway prairie or desert. I am having the experience of a lifetime.</p>
<p class="indent">I have come here to tape an episode of my television series, <em>New Scandinavian Cooking.</em> This is the last frontier, the northernmost Norwegian territory and one of the few remaining areas of totally unspoiled wilderness in Europe, even the world. Out here there is nothing but snow, ice, and the occasional polar bear. If we get stranded, we will definitely not last long.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_16"/>While mainland Norway can at times seem rough and inhospitable, like living near the margins of existence, Spitsbergen, a barren and beautiful island in the Svalbard archipelago, less than 750 miles from the North Pole, is far more extreme. Most of the year the island is covered by a blanket of snow and ice, and it is shrouded in darkness for more than four months each winter. It is impossible to grow anything here—a few robust shrubs, lichen, moss, and some fragile flowers are the only vegetation that can be found during the bright, cool summer. At a latitude of 79 degrees north, it is the northernmost inhabited place in the world, and the twenty-five hundred inhabitants who live here could not survive without the help of technology and a steady supply of goods from the mainland. On the outskirts of Longyearbyen (“Longyear City,” named after its American discoverer, John Monroe Longyear), the capital of the Svalbard archipelago, a “Beware of the Polar Bear” sign reminds us that we are only visitors here, that this territory really belongs to nature.</p>
<p class="indent">My guide is Ann Jorid Pedersen, a woman in her thirties who says she got the Svalbard bug after her first visit in the 1980s, and who ten years later gave up a comfortable life on the mainland in order to live in the Arctic.</p>
<p class="indent">In her office in Longyearbyen, she is a modern businesswoman who deals with travel agents and tourists from all over the world. But when she is wrapped in her sealskin jacket and furry hat, she looks like one of the gatherers who used to live here, and seeing the way she drives her snowmobile, and her confident way of handling the rifle she carries to protect us from attacking polar bears, makes it hard to believe that she is not native to this wilderness.</p>
<p class="indent">Now, in early May, life is as good as it gets at this latitude. Winter and summer have collided in a spectacular show of force: The landscape is as icy and wintry white as ever, but at the same time the midnight sun shines all day and all night. It is a bit on the cool side, I must admit—around zero degrees—and whenever I stop the snowmobile and pull off one of the three hats I’m wearing, so I can enjoy the intense quiet of the Arctic, my ears start to burn with the cold. But once wrapped up again I feel protected and warm, and the beauty of nature and the intensity of the light more than make up for the cold.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_17"/>Svalbard is home to large colonies of seals and walruses, polar bears, and a special subspecies of reindeer not found anywhere else in the world. The reindeer are highly adapted to life on Svalbard: Furry, short-legged, and heavily built, they have a thick layer of body fat that protects them against the cold, allowing them to survive for long periods of time without food. The islands have visitors as well: Every spring, flocks of geese arrive from southern Europe and Africa to nest and to feed on the little vegetation there is. Seeing the elegant long-necked geese arriving, quacking happily as they fly into the icy valleys, you wonder how they can possibly fit into this environment, but they do, and during the short summer they grow surprisingly fat.</p>
<p class="indent">We are traveling from Long-yearbyen to the Temple Fjord at the foot of the Von Post Glacier, where MS <em>Origo,</em> a small cruise ship that has been left to freeze in the ice, serves as a hotel. We have the best weather possible, with clear blue skies and an unlimited view. Then suddenly, just as we catch a glimpse of the boat in the distance, the weather changes, and within five minutes we are engulfed by a ferocious snowstorm. We have to reduce speed, and even though I am driving less than a hundred feet behind Ann’s snowmobile, I sometimes lose sight of her red taillights.</p>
<p class="indent">When we finally arrive at the ship, I feel frozen, more like the frail city boy I am than the adventurer that I had earlier imagined. Later in the evening, after we have thawed out, we make supper—a beet soup inspired by the Russian borscht, but using goose stock from the local Svalbard geese instead of beef stock.</p>
<p class="indent">While the goose and beet soup is cooking, filling the ship with a maddeningly delicious smell, I read a book about the trappers and hunters who lived on Svalbard more than a century ago. They all wrote diaries to maintain their sanity and keep track of time.</p>
<p class="indent">Confined as they were most of the time inside their small cabins, food seemed to be the only thing that really interested them, and their diaries are full of longing for fresh food, as well as complaints about rancid meat and insufficient provisions. Only two things were able to lighten their gloomy moods: the occasional chocolate from the small supply they brought with them from the mainland and the springtime arrival of geese. Eating the rich goose meat after months of seal meat and oat porridge filled them with bliss. “Today we had roast goose, flown in from the Nubia on the wings of fortune,” one hunter wrote ecstatically.</p>
<p class="indent">The Svalbard goose has all the luxurious complexity of farmed goose, but also a rich gamy flavor that only the special combination of tropical and Arctic vegetation can provide.</p>
<p class="indent">That night, safe in the belly of the ship as the snowstorm raged outside, I felt truly blessed. Eating the simple steaming hot soup in the small teak-lined dining room was one of the most enjoyable dining experiences I have ever had.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_23"/>FISH SOUP: THE BERGEN REMEDY</h3>
<p class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/01fig05.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent">To me, the only remedy for long rainy days is soup. The warm comfort of a good filling fish soup is one of the few things that can make up for the lack of sun. The people of Bergen, Norway’s second largest city, need that remedy more often than most. Situated at the end of a fjord, the city, known to most Norwegians as “the Rainy City,” is trapped between seven ragged mountains. Warm, humid air from the Atlantic Ocean is blown into the fjord by the more or less constant westerly wind and then trapped by the cold mountains, causing rain more than 260 days a year. People dress appropriately, but a raincoat or umbrella is seldom far away. You will find strategically located umbrella-vending machines in and around town.</p>
<p class="indent">But despite the gray skies and the more or less constant dampness, it is still said that Bergen has the highest quality of life and the most content population in Norway. Whereas Oslo, the capital, is a modern city with a constantly changing cityscape and population, Bergen has maintained a nineteenth-century grandeur, a self-contented Old World atmosphere that strangers sometimes interpret—rightly or wrongly—as arrogance. The industrial base has changed considerably since the time when cod was king and sailing ships from Bergen were found in ports all over the world. Today academia, shipbuilding, and hypermodern fish farming are the most important industries, but through its stubborn and proud city patriotism, Bergen has managed to make the transformation to modernity without losing its soul.</p>
<p class="indent">Nowhere are that pride and soul more visible than at the fish market in the middle of town. In the square next to the long rectangular harbor lies northern Europe’s largest outdoor fish market, with dozens of stalls offering a huge selection of the freshest fish and shellfish. Despite the rain, the market is always crowded with people, and on Saturdays there are long lines. Walking through the market can make even the most ardent carnivore develop a deep hunger for fish, and even though I am always there as a visitor and hardly ever have access to kitchen facilities, I can walk around the market for hours, enjoying the atmosphere and imagining what I would <a id="page_24"/>prepare. There are scary-looking monkfish with their enormous heads and monsterlike faces, shiny green and blue mackerel, beautiful pink salmon, sad-eyed redfish, fierce-looking wolffish, enormous halibut, charmingly freckled plaice, and the occasional mackerel shark. There is also an abundance of fish roe products, and smoked salmon with an orange tint, which tells you that the fish has been smoked in an old-fashioned smokehouse. You can even buy live fish: A few of the best stalls have giant saltwater tanks filled with live crabs, lobsters, pollock, or cod. With most fish, freshness is of utmost importance, and nothing could be a better quality assurance than to see your dinner swimming around in clear water just hours before you cook it.</p>
<p class="indent">When I get hungry from looking at all the fish, I buy an oyster, shucked by the fishmonger and offered in the half-shell, or a freshly boiled Norwegian lobster—a small, pale orange, crawfishlike crustacean with pink sweet lobster-flavored flesh, one of the finest foods I know. It needs nothing to complement it, and I eat it with my hands as I walk.</p>
<p class="indent">The fabulous access to fresh fish has left its mark on both the city and its cooking. While Norway as a whole has experienced an often troubling internationalization of its everyday cooking, in Bergen, traditional food is still a part of the everyday diet and people have access to plenty of good, cheap local food. Workers can choose between international foods such as kebabs and hamburgers or traditional smoked salmon sandwiches and fish soup for lunch—the price is more or less the same. There is even a fish-based fast-food shop near the city square where the Hagelin sisters sell snow-white fish dumplings and other traditional dishes.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_25"/>Bergen’s most important contribution to international cuisine is its fish soup, which, according to many, deserves a place alongside bouillabaisse as one of the best fish soups in the world. The soup is the extreme opposite of its French counterpart: Where the sun-scorched bouillabaisse is temperamental and pushy, Bergen fish soup is warming and seductive. The soup is made with stock from young pollock, and the orthodox will tell you that the pollock must be bought live at the fish market the same day you make the soup, but I have found that it tastes just as good with fish stock from the fishmonger. With no herbs or spices for flavor, just root vegetables, the soup is totally dependent on the quality of the fish. The addition of sugar and sour cream, and sometimes a few drops of vinegar, gives it an interesting sweet-and-sour flavor, but apart from that, the soup is just the refined essence of the sea, with a purity and flavor-richness unsurpassed by any other fish soup I have tasted.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Bergen Fish Soup</h3>
<p class="image"><a id="page_22"/><img alt="image" src="../images/01fig04.jpg"/></p>
<div class="blue">
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_26"/><small><strong>WHILE THE CLASSIC WAY TO MAKE THIS FISH SOUP IS WITH YOUR OWN STOCK MADE FROM VERY FRESH YOUNG POLLOCK, IT IS ABSOLUTELY PERMISSIBLE TO USE FISH STOCK BOUGHT FROM THE LOCAL FISHMONGER.</strong></small></p>
</div>
<p class="noindents">SERVES 10</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 quarts fish stock (see headnote)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 carrots, cut into 1-inch by ¼-inch sticks</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>I large celeriac, peeled and cut into 1-inch by ¼-inch sticks</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 small parsley roots or parsnips, peeled and cut into 1-inch by ¼-inch sticks</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 celery stalks, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 to 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour for thickening (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup heavy (whipping) cream</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup good red wine vinegar, or to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup salted veal stock (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fine sea salt</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ pounds mixed fish fillets, such as salmon, cod, and halibut, or other firm white-fleshed fish, cut into 2-inch chunks</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fish Dumplings (<a class="nounder" href="ch01.html#ch01_rec2">recipe follows</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 large egg yolks</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>One 8-ounce container sour cream</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Chopped fresh chives for garnish (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Bring the fish stock to a boil in a large pot. Add the vegetables, reduce the heat, and let simmer for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindentt">If you are using the flour, whisk it together with the cream in a small bowl, add the cream to the soup, and bring to a boil. Add the sugar and vinegar to taste; the soup should have a subtle sweet-and-sour flavor. Add the veal stock, if using, and salt to taste. Add the fish and fish dumplings, bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 7 to 8 minutes, until the fish is just cooked.</p>
<p class="noindentt">In the meantime, whisk together the egg yolks and sour cream in a small bowl. Pour the soup into bowls, dividing the fish and dumplings evenly. Gently stir 2 to 3 tablespoons of the sour cream mixture into each bowl. Sprinkle with chives, if desired, and serve.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindent">There are different, equally authentic ways of making the soup. The big schism is between those who like to thicken the soup with a combination of flour and cream, so it becomes like a chowder, and those who prefer it thin. I think it is easier to appreciate the unique sweet-and-sour freshness of the soup when it is made with only the minimum of thickener.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Its combined lightness and richness make it easy to eat a lot of the fish soup, but any leftovers can be frozen for later.</p>

<p class="uln"><strong>2 large eggs</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 to 3 tablespoons cornstarch</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon fine sea salt</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ teaspoons freshly ground white pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 cups whipped cream</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Run the fish through a meat grinder twice; it should be very fine and smooth. (You can also use a food processor, although it can be more difficult to get a smooth consistency that way.)</p>
<p class="noindentt">In a large bowl, lightly beat the eggs. Add the cornstarch, salt, pepper, and fish and mix well. Gently fold the cream into the fish mixture, trying not to deflate cream.</p>
<p class="noindentt">With a spoon, form the dumpling mixture into small balls.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><strong><small>NOTE:</small></strong> If serving the dumplings on their own, bring a pot of salted water (or fish stock) to a boil. Add the dumplings, reduce the heat, and simmer for about 7 minutes, until cooked through. Remove with a slotted spoon, and serve with béchamel sauce, if desired.</p>
<div class="box">

<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup tarragon vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 large eggs</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">In a medium pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour and cook, stirring, until you have a thick roux—that is, a thick smooth butter-and-flour mixture. Stir in the milk little by little, then the chicken stock. Add the spinach and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes, or until the spinach is wilted.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Transfer the soup to a blender, in batches, and blend until smooth. Return the soup to the pot, season with salt and pepper, and keep warm over low heat.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Meanwhile, in a large pot, combine 4 quarts of water, the ½ 2 cup salt, and the tarragon vinegar and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat. Break 1 egg into a small bowl and gently lower it into the hot water with a large spoon. Repeat with the remaining 3 eggs. Poach for 5 to 8 minutes, depending on how cooked you like your eggs.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Pour the spinach soup into bowls. Add a poached egg to each and serve.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindent">This is a modernized version of the traditional nettle soup that in Norway marks the coming of spring. Picking nettles, even the young ones used in the soup, can be painful, so when I found out that the soup tasted just as good with spinach, I was thoroughly relieved.</p>

<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup aquavit (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh chervil</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">In a medium pot, bring the chicken stock to a boil. Add the cream, white wine, and cauliflower; the cauliflower should be almost covered with liquid. Cook for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the cauliflower is soft.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Add the milk, butter, and aquavit, if using, and heat until simmering.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Transfer the soup to a blender, in batches if necessary, add the chervil, and blend until smooth and frothy. Pour into bowls and serve.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><strong><small>VARIATION:</small></strong> To give the soup more texture and substance, I like to add a few chunks of cooked diced chicken and reserved chunks of cauliflower just before serving.</p>

<div class="blue">
<p class="noindent"><small><strong>TRADITIONALLY THIS SOUP WAS MADE WITH A RICH STOCK FROM SMOKED PORK KNUCKLE. I USE A GOOD PORK OR BEEF STOCK AND SOME BACON.</strong></small></p>
</div>
<p class="noindents">SERVES 4</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>10 ounces dried yellow peas, soaked overnight in cold water to cover, drained</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 slices bacon, finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 onion, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 cups pork stock or beef stock</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup finely chopped celeriac</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup finely chopped leek, white and pale green parts only</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small sprig fresh rosemary</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 bay leaf</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon chopped fresh herbs, such as thyme, sage, and rosemary</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Sour cream for serving</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Heat the butter in a medium pot over medium heat. Fry the bacon for 4 to 5 minutes, until crispy. Add the onion and sauté for 5 minutes, or until soft and golden. Add the peas, stock, celeriac, leek, rosemary sprig, and bay leaf and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer gently for 1 hour, until the peas are starting to dissolve. Remove the rosemary sprig and bay leaf. Stir the soup energetically with a whisk or a wooden spoon until it has a somewhat smoother consistency.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Stir in the herbs. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Pour the soup into bowls and serve with sour cream on the side.</p>

<p class="noindent">Until recently, dried peas were an important part of the Norwegian diet, but they have now been almost entirely displaced by fresh or frozen peas. This is a pity, since the fresh and dried are not at all interchangeable.</p>
<p class="noindentt">While fresh peas are sweet and tender, dried peas are rich, rough, and starchy—on a cold winter day, nothing warms your body like a classic pea soup. (Note that the peas must be soaked overnight.)</p>
<p class="noindentt">Serve with bread and a small bowl of sour cream on the side.</p>
