  <p class="center-para"><a id="page_35" class="calibre1"></a>Pasta is the best-loved dish of all Italians and its popularity has spread worldwide – no wonder, as it makes a satisfying meal and many pasta dishes are quick to cook. However, there are lots of sauces and baked pasta dishes that require long, slow cooking. One of the best examples has to be ragù: there are many variations of ragù, but all are based on the principle of meat or other ingredients cooked very slowly so that they become superbly tender and their flavour creates a wonderful sauce. During hunting season, I will use whatever I have caught – perhaps pheasant, pigeon, hare or rabbit – cooked slowly to make a deliciously rich sauce to serve with pappardelle or tagliatelle.</p>

  <p class="center-para">My family’s slow-cooked ragù, which we enjoyed for Sunday lunches, would take at least 12 hours to cook. My <em class="calibre4">zia</em> (aunt) Maria was the expert and she would start her ragù on Saturday and leave it to cook very, very gently on the smallest of flames on the stove all through the night for a ragù that was cooked to absolute perfection – the meat so tender and crumbly and the dense sauce with its unforgettable consistency and taste.</p>

  <p class="center-para">I love pasta dishes that can be served as two courses, such as the southern Italian <a href="part0008_split_003.html#ch2sec2" class="calibre1">ragù</a> and <em class="calibre4"><a href="part0008_split_002.html#ch2sec1" class="calibre1">La Genovese</a></em>, where a large piece of meat is cooked slowly and the resulting sauce is served with pasta as a first course followed by the meat as a main. These are some of my favourite dishes to cook, especially when I have a crowd for dinner. Not only are they simple to prepare, they go a long way and you know they will please everyone!</p>

  <p class="center-para">When I was growing up in southern Italy, <em class="calibre4">pasta al forno</em>, or baked pasta, was a must for special occasions like Christmas, weddings and christenings. At these times, the wood fire would be lit well in advance and large terracotta dishes would be baked for hours. A lasagne made with tomato sauce, meatballs, boiled eggs and lots of local salami and cheese was a sure favourite at these grand occasions. Baked pasta dishes can be made in advance and slowly cooked in the oven, and they don’t mind waiting around before you serve them. They are ever-popular for Sunday lunches, at parties, or when you have lots of people round.</p>
