<p class="normal"><b>The town of Morteau gave its name to this well-known sausage and it comes from the same part of France as I do, which is Franche-Comté, to the east of the country next to the Jura mountains. Local cooks only use pork from the region, because the animals are fattened traditionally. In addition, to be permitted to use the label saucisse de morteau, the sausage must be smoked at least 48 hours over sawdust from conifer and juniper trees. In this recipe, the cranberry beans bring a nuttiness, which is complemented by the sweet flavor of the oven-dried tomato. Throw in some garlic and herbs and a drizzle of French dressing and this dish is sure to impress!</b></p>

<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 15 minutes, plus overnight soaking and 30 minutes infusing</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 2½ hours</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">6 garlic cloves, 3 unpeeled, lightly crushed, plus 1 whole and 2 chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">9 ounces cherry tomatoes, cut in half crosswise and gently squeezed</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 teaspoon confectioner’s sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">leaves from 1 thyme sprig</p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ cup dried cranberry beans, soaked overnight, drained and rinsed</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 large carrot, peeled</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 shallot</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 flat-leaf parsley sprig, plus 1 tablespoon chopped leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 morteau sausages or other smoked sausage, about 10 ounces each, pricked with a knife</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 tablespoons French Dressing (see <a href="012_9781848991583_Recipe6.html">page 18</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Heat the oven to 225°F. Put the oil and the whole unpeeled garlic cloves in a small roasting pan in the oven 30 minutes to infuse. Remove and leave the garlic to one side. Add the tomatoes to the pan, cut-side up, then sprinkle with the confectioner’s sugar and season with salt and pepper. Scatter the thyme over the top and roast 2½ hours until the tomatoes are dried and wrinkly.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> After the tomatoes have been cooking 1 hour, put the soaked cranberry beans in a saucepan and cover with plenty of cold water. Bring to a boil, then skim off any foam that rises to the surface. Add the carrot, shallot, parsley sprig and the peeled whole garlic clove. Turn the heat down to a simmer, cover the pan and simmer 30 minutes. Add the sausages to the pan, re-cover it and simmer 30 minutes longer, or until the beans are tender and the sausages cooked through.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Use a slotted spoon to transfer the sausages to a bowl, then cover with plastic wrap. Strain the beans, reserving the cooking liquid in a separate pan. Tip the beans into a bowl. Discard the garlic clove and parsley sprig, then cut the carrot into small dice and add to the beans. Return the cooking liquid to the heat, bring to a a boil and boil about 5 minutes until it reduces by half. Whisk in one-third of the French dressing.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Add the oven-dried tomatoes to the beans along with the remaining chopped garlic, chopped parsley and another one-third of the dressing and mix gently. Discard the skin from the sausage and cut the meat into thick slices. Serve the sausage on top of the beans and drizzle with the remaining dressing to serve.</p>
