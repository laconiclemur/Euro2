<h2 class="h2b">TOURTE DE BLETTES</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Swiss Chard Tart</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>A strange-sounding idea but one rooted deep in tradition. I first came across it in old Nice when I thought I’d just misunderstood what the waitress had told me. I was sent scuttling through my phrase book to little avail. I shouldn’t have bothered. It was and is delicious. The peach is a modern addition, which I think works well. Although afternoon tea is not really a niçois tradition, I think it is the perfect time for this tart</em>.</p>
<div class="hang0">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 6–8</span><br/>
500g (1lb 2oz) plain flour<br/>
200g (7oz) unsalted butter<br/>
150g (5½ oz) caster sugar<br/>
2 eggs, plus 2 egg yolks</p>
</div>
<div class="hang00">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FILLING</span><br/>
1 small bunch Swiss chard<br/>
50g (1¾ oz) Parmesan, freshly grated<br/>
2 eggs<br/>
100g (3½ oz) currants<br/>
100g (3½ oz) raisins<br/>
100g (3½ oz) pine nuts<br/>
150g (5½ oz) soft brown sugar<br/>
2 tbsp olive oil<br/>
1 large peach or apple</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Mix the flour with the butter and sugar by hand or in your food processor until it becomes sandy, then add the whole eggs and a little water to bind. Knead the mixture then separate it into two-thirds and one-third. Pat each into a flat circle and put in the fridge to ‘harden’ for about an hour.</p>
<p class="normal">During this time remove and discard any of the base stalks of the Swiss chard. Separate the remaining stalks and leaves, and slice both as finely as possible. Rinse thoroughly and dry very well between two tea towels. Mix with the rest of the filling ingredients except for the peach, and set aside.</p>
<p class="normala">Preheat your oven to 190°C/375°F/Gas 5.</p>
<p class="normala">Have ready a tart tin of about 20cm (8in) in diameter. Roll both pieces of pastry between sheets of floured clingfilm. The round which is to be the base needs to be a lot larger than the tin, and the round for the lid just slightly larger than the tin. You will have far too much pastry, which makes it easier (freeze any trimmings for another use). When the pastry is rolled, put it in the fridge for 10 minutes before you use it. Line the tin with the larger piece of pastry, then spoon your Swiss chard mixture inside. Halve the peach and remove the stone. Slice the flesh and fan it around the top of the mixture. Wet the sides of the pastry a little, roll the second piece of pastry around your rolling pin, and gently roll it over the top. Seal the edges well, then remove any excess with a small knife.</p>
<p class="normala">Mix the 2 egg yolks with 2 tablespoons water, strain and then glaze the top of the pastry. Bake for about 30 minutes in the preheated oven until it is golden brown. Once cooked, transfer it to a cooling rack.</p>
<p class="normal2"><span class="smallcaps">ON EGG WASHING</span></p>
<p class="normala">Using just the yolks, rather than the whole egg, achieves a perfect dark glaze. Adding a little water to this gets the texture right for a smooth glaze. The straining removes any bits of albumen which may be hanging about.</p>
<p class="normal2"><span class="smallcaps">ON SHORT PASTRY</span></p>
<p class="normala">If you let short pastry cool in the fridge once it has been rolled you will have a much easier time shaping and cutting it.</p>
<p class="normal2"><span class="smallcaps">ON TART TINS</span></p>
<p class="normala">The very best tart tin to have is one with no base – a ring, in effect – so that when your tart is cooked you just slide it off the sheet of silicone paper on the baking tray on to a rack and slip the ring off.</p>
