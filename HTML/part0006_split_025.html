			<p class="rec-intro">I remember being dragged out into the fields with my father and mother to collect snails after a heavy shower. We purged (fasted) the snails for several days and washed them in copious amounts of salted water. They then had to be boiled, removed from the shell, intestines trimmed off and finally bottled and preserved for later use. Thankfully you can now buy jars or cans of very good-quality precooked snails, with all the hard work already done – though I look back on those days with much fondness.</p>

			<p class="body">Pour in the Chartreuse, turn up the heat and boil until the pan is almost dry. Add the cream and simmer until the mixture has the consistency of a sauce. Season well and finish with a few drops of lemon juice and a little finely grated zest. Serve in little pots with a sprinkling of parsley.</p>
