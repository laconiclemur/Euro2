<p class="normal"><b>I love all the less expensive, and often forgotten, cuts of pork, beef or lamb. Here, I’m using Boston butt, from the hog’s shoulder, which isn’t so rare these days, but is best when it’s braised, rather than roasted. Ask your butcher to cut the pork into large cubes and to keep the fat on, because it will make the dish much more flavorsome and also keep it moist, which for me is essential. For the best texture, crush the cooked meat partially using a fork—you are not making a rillette so you don’t want it too smooth.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt">4 teaspoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 pound 5 ounces boneless, fatty Boston butt, cut into large cubes</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 small carrots, peeled and chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 shallots, chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 garlic cloves, unpeeled, lightly crushed</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup dry white wine</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 cups Chicken Stock (see <a href="007_9781848991583_Recipe1.html#pageid_16">page 16</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 Idaho potatoes, about 7 ounces each, peeled</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon chopped sage leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="acktxt">green salad, to serve</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Heat the oven to 275°F. Melt the butter with 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. When the butter is foaming, add the pork, carrots, shallots and garlic and cook 5 minutes, or until everything is just beginning to brown. Add the white wine and simmer, deglazing the pan by stirring to remove any caramelized bits stuck to the bottom, until the liquid reduces by two-thirds. Pour in the stock and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low, partially cover and cook 2 hours, stirring every 30 minutes, until the meat is very tender but not quite falling apart. The sauce should be thick enough to coat the back of the spoon.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> While the pork cooks, make a horizontal cut along the length of each potato, about one-quarter of the way down, to make a lid. Set its lid next to each potato. Using a teaspoon, scoop out the insides of the potatoes, leaving a ¼-inch shell. (You can discard the flesh or save it for another recipe.) Season the insides with salt and pepper and divide the remaining oil between them. Put the lids back on and tightly wrap in plastic wrap. Bring a large saucepan of water on to a simmer, with a steamer insert on top. Put the potatoes in the steamer, cover and cook over very low heat 1 to 1¼ hours until they are just tender. Turn off the heat, then leave the potatoes in the steamer to cook in the residual heat 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> When the meat is nearly ready, remove the plastic wrap from the potatoes, lift off the lids and turn the potatoes upside-down on a clean dish towel to absorb any condensation. Turn the potatoes over and put them in a roasting pan.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Remove the pork from the heat, spoon slighly less than ½ cup of the cooking juices into a bowl and leave to one side. Lightly crush the meat with a fork, stir in the sage and season with salt and pepper. Fill each potato with the mixture, taking care not to break them, cover with the potato lid, then spoon the reserved juices over the top. Put the potatoes in the oven 15 minutes, or until they are hot and bubbling. Serve with a green salad.</p>
