  <p class="chap-para">This dish from the Lombardy region of northern Italy was traditionally made on the feast of Saint Anthony on 17 January to mark the end of the pig slaughtering season. No part of the pig was ever wasted and the cheaper cuts, such as trotters, skin, ears, nose, ribs and tail, were used to make this stew – the better parts were for curing into hams and salami. This dish is still popular today and I have adapted it with more readily available cuts of pork. Serve with runny polenta (cornmeal), as they do in Lombardy, or mashed potatoes for a perfect winter warmer. The addition of Parmesan rind gives the stew an extra bit of flavour. When you finish a piece of Parmesan, don’t discard the rind; wrap it in clingfilm (plastic wrap) and store in the fridge to add to soups and stews.</p>
