<h5 class="h5"><a id="pageid_103"/><b>Pumpkin</b> <span class="smfont">and</span> <b>Goat Cheese Lasagne</b></h5>
<p class="normal"><b>This “lasagne” is made with very thin layers of pumpkin, rather than pasta, as you would traditionally expect. For me, goat cheese is perfect with pumpkin, while the addition of pumpkin seeds and a drizzle of pumpkin oil make this a delicate, light and surprisingly lovely meal. I have also suggested a tasty little salad that you might like make to serve with the lasagne.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt">4½-pound piece pumpkin, skin removed and seeded</p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons whole milk</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 cups whipping cream</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 rosemary sprig</p>
<p class="acktxt">a pinch freshly grated nutmeg</p>
<p class="acktxt">10 ounces soft goat cheese log, rind removed, crumbled</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 pinches toasted pumpkin seeds</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon toasted pumpkin seed oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">3½ ounces firm sheep’s milk cheese, such as Ossau Iraty, diced</p>
<p class="acktxta">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE GOATS CHEESE AND PUMPKIN SALAD</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">2½ ounces corn salad leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon toasted pumpkin seeds</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 ounces soft goat cheese log, rind removed, crumbled</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 teaspoon toasted pumpkin seed oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon Chardonnay vinegar or white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Cut a 5- x 3-inch rectangle, 2 inches thick, from the pumpkin, then cut it into twelve <img alt="image" src="images/1by16.jpg"/>-inch-thick slices, using a mandolin or a very sharp knife. Chop the remaining pumpkin into bite-size cubes (about 6¼ cups).</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Put the cubed pumpkin in a saucepan with the milk, half the cream, the rosemary sprig and the nutmeg and cook over very low heat 10 to 15 minutes until the pumpkin is just tender, but with a little resistance. Using a slotted spoon, lift out the pumpkin and leave it to one side. Reserve the milk mixture in the pan.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Meanwhile, bring a saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add the pumpkin slices, a few at a time, and cook 2 to 3 minutes until they are just tender and pliable, then use a slotted spoon to transfer them to a bowl of ice water and leave 1 minute. Lift them out and drain on paper towels, keeping the slices separate, then season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Return the saucepan containing the milk mixture to medium heat. Add the remaining cream and the goat cheese. Turn the heat down to low and cook, whisking continuously, until the cheese melts and the sauce thickens to a silky texture. Discard the rosemary sprig.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> Meanwhile, heat the oven to 350°F and grease a 8½- x 7-inch baking dish with the butter. Overlap 4 slices of the pumpkin on the bottom of the dish. Scatter with half the pumpkin cubes, then add half the toasted pumpkin seeds and pumpkin oil and finish with one-third of the sauce. Repeat with another 4 slices of pumpkin, then the rest of the pumpkin cubes, seeds and oil. Spread another one-third of the sauce over the top, then finish with the remaining pumpkin slices. Add the remaining sauce and sprinkle with the sheep’s milk cheese. Bake 20 minutes, or until golden and bubbling. Turn the oven up to maximum and continue cooking 5 to 8 minutes until golden brown. Leave to rest 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>6</b> Meanwhile, prepare the salad, if you like. Toss the corn salad, pumpkin seeds and crumbled cheese together in a bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the oils and vinegar and season with salt and pepper. Drizzle the salad with the dressing, toss and serve with the lasagne.</p>
