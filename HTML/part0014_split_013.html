  <p class="chap-para">Babà is a classic Neapolitan dessert which, according to legend, was introduced by the French and is usually made with rum. In my region, where lemons are plentiful, the pastry shops often make it with <em class="calibre4">limoncello</em> liqueur. For this recipe, I decided to give oranges a go, and they really work well. You need to make this at least one day before you intend to serve it because, once cooked, it needs to be ‘dried out’ overnight before being soaked in the syrup. This is the original large babà, made in a ring mould, rather than the small babàs sold in pastry shops.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 8–10</p>

  <p class="ing1">450g/1lb/scant 4 cups ‘00’ flour</p>

  <p class="ing1">50g/1¾oz/¼ cup caster (superfine) sugar</p>

  <p class="ing1">a pinch of salt</p>

  <p class="ing1">40g/1½oz fresh yeast, diluted in 2 tbsp lukewarm water</p>

  <p class="ing1">8 eggs</p>

  <p class="ing">150g/5½oz/generous ½ cup butter, softened, plus extra to grease</p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the syrup</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 large oranges</p>

  <p class="ing1">400g/14oz/2 cups granulated sugar</p>

  <p class="ing2">100ml/3½fl oz/scant ½ cup orange liqueur, or more if you prefer a stronger taste</p>

  <p class="para">Grease a 22cm/8½-inch fluted babà or savarin mould with butter.</p>

  <p class="para">Combine the flour, sugar, salt and yeast mixture in a large bowl. Whisk in the eggs and softened butter for about 10 minutes, until the mixture comes away from the sides of the bowl. Cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rise in a warm place for 30 minutes, until the mixture has doubled in size. Beat the mixture for a minute, then pour into the greased mould and leave to rise in a warm place for 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas mark 4.</p>

  <p class="para">Bake the babà for 40 minutes, until well risen and golden brown. Leave to cool slightly in the mould, then turn out onto a wire rack and leave to dry out overnight.</p>

  <p class="para">Meanwhile, make the syrup. Using a vegetable peeler, peel the zest of the oranges in strips, taking care not to remove any of the white pith; set aside a few pieces and cut into thinner strips. Put the sugar in a saucepan and add 1.5 litres/2¾ pints/1½ quarts water and the orange zest, stir well until the sugar has dissolved, bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer very gently for 1 hour. Strain through a fine sieve and leave to cool. Add the orange liqueur and set aside.</p>

  <p class="para">Put the syrup in a container large enough to hold the babà. Very carefully place the babà inside and, using a ladle, drizzle the syrup all over the cake. When well soaked, carefully remove the babà, with the help of a fish slice, and place on a serving plate. Decorate with the reserved orange zest and serve.</p>
