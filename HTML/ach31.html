<h3 class="h3b"><a id="page_60"/><a id="ach31"/>italian bread dumpling soup</h3>
<p class="author1"><span class="txit">zuppa di canederli</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This is a very traditional soup from the Veneto region of northern Italy, which is close to the Austrian border, and the influence on northern Italian cuisine is evident. This soup is very practical, relying principally on dry bread, and is often served as a pasta course. This dumpling dough (<span class="txit">canederli</span> in Italian) also may be rolled into a 3-inch-thick log, wrapped in a clean dish towel, and simmered for about 1 hour. When cooked through, it is then sliced and served with a meat-based pasta sauce, such as ragù.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups diced dry Italian white bread (about 4 ounces)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">6 cups chicken broth</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup all-purpose flour</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup thinly sliced, then finely chopped pancetta (about 2 ounces)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">3</sub> cup thinly sliced, then finely chopped hard salami (about 1 ounce)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 large egg, lightly beaten</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup milk</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Pinch of ground nutmeg</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> teaspoon kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Air-dry the bread cubes overnight, or place them on a baking sheet and bake in an oven preheated to 300° F, stirring occasionally, until dry but not brown, about 20 minutes. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Place the chicken broth in a medium-size saucepan set over medium-high heat. Cover with the lid askew and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Meanwhile, in a medium-size bowl, combine the bread with the flour, pancetta, salami, egg, milk, chives, parsley, nutmeg, and salt. Mix well, using your hands if necessary to evenly incorporate the ingredients. The dough should be moist and malleable. Scoop out rounded tablespoons of the dough and roll into balls.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_61"/><span class="red">4.</span> Add the dough to the simmering chicken broth. Cook until all the balls are floating on the surface of the broth and are cooked though, about 8 minutes. Do not stir.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> Remove the dumplings from the broth with a slotted spoon and distribute them equally among four soup bowls. Ladle the broth into the bowls and serve immediately.</p>
