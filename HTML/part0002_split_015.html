			<p class="rec-intro">This is a traditional way of using duck necks in southwest France and is usually served cold with a little salad or some radishes. Alternatively, Cumberland sauce, that great British accompaniment for cold cuts, also goes well. </p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 10 as a starter</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 duck necks</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">500g duck meat, cleaned of fat and sinew</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">120g pork back fat</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">350g cooked foie gras</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 tsp chopped thyme leaves</p>

			<p class="ing-nu">60g cooked truffle, chopped </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">pinch of ground coriander </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">250ml duck stock (see <a href="part0010_split_004.html#duck-stock" class="calibre4">here</a>)</p>

			<p class="body">The duck necks should be as long as possible and have no holes. Remove the neck bones, sinew and excess fat. Using butcher’s string, tie each neck at the thin end ready for stuffing. </p>
			<p class="body">Chop the meat, fat and foie gras into 1cm dice. Mince a third of this as finely as possible, then fold it into the rest of the meat. Add the thyme leaves, pistachios and truffle and season with the coriander, salt and pepper. Pour the duck stock into a small pan and reduce it to a sticky syrup, then fold it into the mixture. </p>
			<p class="body">Push the stuffing into the necks, making sure there are no air pockets, and tie the ends securely with butcher’s string. Take a pan that’s big enough for the duck necks to lie flat, add water and a pinch of salt. Heat the water to 70°C, then add the duck necks and poach them gently for 40 minutes. </p>
			<p class="body">Take the pan off the heat and leave the necks to cool a little, then remove them and refrigerate. They are best left to mature for 48 hours before slicing and serving, and they keep well for a couple of weeks in the fridge. </p>
