<p class="author1"><span class="txit">zeppole</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">My mother claims, “In all modesty, my mother’s <span class="txit">zeppole</span> were the best I’ve ever tasted. They were lighter than all others and not laden with oil.” My grandmother prepared these fritters for holidays and special occasions, such as Christmas Eve. Her family ate them plain, while the Tucci family dusted them with granulated sugar. Zeppole are good either way, and taste best if you eat them right after they’ve been fried. You can also fry them earlier in the day and reheat in the oven.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 medium-size all-purpose potatoes (about 1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">3</sub> pounds)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 package dry yeast</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup warm water</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 cups all-purpose flour</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Corn oil for frying</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Place the potatoes in a pot, cover with cold water, and bring to a boil. Cook the potatoes until tender when pierced with a knife, about 15 minutes. Drain, peel, and quarter. Season with salt before mashing until smooth with a potato masher or electric mixer. Transfer to a large bowl.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> In a measuring cup, dissolve the yeast in the warm water. Set aside for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Mix 1 cup of the flour into the mashed potatoes. Stir in the yeast mixture. Mix in 2 cups more of the flour. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface. Gradually knead in as much of the remaining cup of flour as necessary to form a soft, dry dough. Slice the dough in half to test the center. If it is still sticky, knead in some more flour.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Place the dough in a clean bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and then with a clean dish towel. Set aside in a warm place to rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_98"/><span class="red">5.</span> Line a baking sheet with two layers of paper towels and set aside. Fill a medium-size frying pan with corn oil to a depth of 1 inch. Warm the oil over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">6.</span> Gently deflate the risen dough. It will be sticky—lightly dust your fingers with flour. Scoop out a 2-tablespoon-size portion of the dough. Shape it with your fingers to create a doughnut shape. Place it in the oil. If the oil is hot enough, the dough will rise to the surface and bubble. Fry until golden on both sides, turning once, 3 to 5 minutes on each side. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and place on the paper-towel-lined baking sheet to drain before serving.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">7.</span> Continue frying the dough in batches of two zeppole at a time. Add more oil to the pan as necessary. Allow the oil to return to frying heat before adding more dough. Serve in small batches after allowing to cool slightly.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATION</span>:</span> Mixing 1 or 2 chopped anchovies with each zeppole creates a nice savory version of this recipe.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Gianni was at our house when we were testing this fried dough recipe for the book. He made a few additional serving suggestions: You may prepare a delectable sandwich by cutting the fried dough in half and filling it with a slice of prosciutto, salami, mortadella, or Asiago cheese.</p>
