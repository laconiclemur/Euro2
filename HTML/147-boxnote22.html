<p class="running_first">Perhaps the most classic and all-purpose piece of Spanish stovetop cookware, the round, flat cazuela is used to stew, simmer, braise, and prepare moist rice dishes. In Valencia, it is also used for preparing rice dishes in the oven. Traditional cazuelas are sturdy and made from glazed terra-cotta, though heavy coated aluminum and cast-iron versions have become popular in recent years.</p>
<p class="running_first">Terra-cotta cazuelas need to be “seasoned” before using the first time. Soak overnight in water and then allow to dry completely. Never place a cold cazuela (holding, say, leftovers) directly on the stovetop heat or it risks cracking. The same goes for a hot cazuela on a cold (say, marble) surface.</p>
<p class="running_first">In general, a cazuela that measures 12 to 13 inches/30 to 32 cm in diameter is ideal for serving four to six people. This is the correct size for the recipes in this book.</p>
<p class="running_first">Spanish terra-cotta cazuelas are easy to buy outside of Spain these days—<a href="261-source.html#page_345">see Sources, page 345</a>, for a few places to start looking.</p>
<p class="running_first">For excellent alternatives, look for anything that cookware shops classify as “low casseroles” or “buffet casseroles.” The best ones are heavy, and allow for slow cooking. I find that pots like Le Creuset’s “round casserole”—it is more like a Dutch oven—work well, too. A large sauté pan or deep skillet is also fine.</p>
<p class="running_first">Many cooks use small <em>cazuelitas</em>—usually around 5 or 6 inches/13 or 15 cm in diameter—to serve, or even prepare, certain tapas and individual desserts. They also make great dishes to serve olives, Spanish almonds, and other nibbles.</p>
