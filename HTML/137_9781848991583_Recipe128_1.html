<p class="normal"><b>This recipe is so French and holds great childhood memories for me. I must have picked strawberries in my garden hundreds of times, and every time with the same enthusiasm. I was always the first to answer when Mom said, “Who wants to go to pick some strawberries?” I was also often the last to come back, because I had been too busy eating them! We’d enjoy a big bowl with a slice of toasted brioche spread with lovely fresh farm butter—so good! But here is a new way to serve them with crème fraîche and freshly chopped tarragon.</b></p>
