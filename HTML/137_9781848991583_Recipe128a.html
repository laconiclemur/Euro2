<h5 class="h5"><b>Orange, Cardamom</b> <span class="smfont">and</span> <b>Thyme Salad</b></h5>
<p class="normal"><b>I love to make this refreshing salad with blood oranges when they are in season. Oranges combine so well with so many desserts, especially chocolate, as the soft, sweet acidity cuts through that rich texture. Try this with my Chocolate, Chili and Lemongrass Tart (see <a href="134_9781848991583_Recipe125.html#pageid_208">page 208</a>). The hint of thyme adds an elegant and unexpected touch.</b></p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">SERVES</span></b> 4</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 15 minutes, plus 30 minutes macerating and 30 minutes cooling</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 small blood oranges or ordinary oranges</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 cardamom pods, lightly crushed</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ teaspoon freshly picked thyme leaves</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Finely pare the orange zest, then peel and segment the oranges over a bowl to catch the juices. Put the cardamom into the juice and leave 30 minutes. Pat the orange segments dry on a clean dish towel.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Put the zest in a saucepan, cover with cold water and bring to a boil. Remove the pan from the heat, drain the zest and refresh under cold water, then drain again; repeat the process. Return the zest to the pan, add the sugar and 3 tablespoons water and stir to dissolve. Bring to a boil and cook 5 minutes, or until the zest is transparent, then leave to cool.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Strain the flavored juice into a small pan over medium heat and cook a few minutes until it reduces by half and is syrupy. Stir in the zest and syrup, then leave to cool. Toss with the orange segments in a bowl, then add the thyme leaves to serve.</p>
