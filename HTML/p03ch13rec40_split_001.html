<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">Chestnut trees and forests are found all over Spain, and chestnuts were a staple of the peasantry before the arrival of potatoes and corn from the Americas. In the time of the Bourbons, cooks in the homes of the aristocracy made</span> marrons glacés <span class="italic">and chestnut puddings. This one is splendid.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 10</span></p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE CARAMEL</span></p>
<p class="qun">½ cup sugar</p>
<p class="qun">3 tablespoons water</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE FLAN</span></p>
<p class="qun">7 ounces fresh peeled (see page 130), defrosted frozen, or vacuum-packed chestnuts</p>
<p class="qun">4½ cups whole milk</p>
<p class="qun">1 cup sugar</p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
<p class="qun">5 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">6 tablespoons Spanish brandy or Cognac</p>
<p class="qun1">7 large eggs</p>
<p class="recsum">For the caramel, put the sugar and water in a saucepan over medium heat. When the syrup begins to bubble and color, swirl the pan to spread the caramel evenly, then cook until it turns a deep amber, swirling the pan occasionally (watch it, as it can turn too dark very quickly). Immediately pour the caramel into a heatproof mold about 9 to 10 inches in diameter and at least 2½ inches high, moving and tilting the mold to coat the bottom and sides well. Do this very fast, because the caramel hardens quickly.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Cook the chestnuts in 2¼ cups of the milk in a pan over low heat for 10 minutes, until they soften. Drain and discard the milk. Put the remaining 2¼ cups milk, the sugar, and the vanilla in a pan and slowly bring to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Grind the chocolate as fine as possible in a food processor. Add the drained chestnuts and blend to a soft paste. Gradually add the warm milk and then the brandy.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Beat the eggs with a fork in a large bowl, then beat in the chestnut mixture. Pour into the caramel-coated mold. Put the mold in a large shallow baking pan and pour in enough boiling water to come about halfway up the sides of the mold. Bake in a preheated 325°F oven for 1 to 1¼ hours, or until the flan feels firm. Let cool, then chill in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours, covered with plastic wrap.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Just before serving, run a pointed knife around the edges of the flan, place a serving dish on top of the mold (the dish should be deep enough to collect the caramel sauce), and turn upside down. Lift off the mold.</p>
