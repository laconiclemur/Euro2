  <p class="chap-para">A perfect treat for breakfast or <em class="calibre4">merenda</em> (tea time) for the children. The ‘slowness’ of this recipe is in the proving, which you must do twice for at least 2 hours; this will ensure the lightness of the brioche. The mixture is quite sticky to work with, so don’t worry, this is how it should be and the results will be worth it. You can make the mixture by hand, but a mixer will be quicker. I prefer to use dark chocolate, giving the brioche a slightly bittersweet taste, but if you are making this for children, use a good-quality milk chocolate.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 8</p>

  <p class="ing1">250g/9oz/2 cups strong (bread) flour</p>

  <p class="ing1">4g (½ sachet) dried yeast</p>

  <p class="ing1">50g/1¾oz/¼ cup caster (superfine) sugar</p>

  <p class="ing1">a pinch of salt</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 tsp ground cinnamon</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 eggs, beaten</p>

  <p class="ing1">200g/7oz/generous ¾ cup butter, softened and cut into small chunks</p>

  <p class="ing1">85g/3oz dark or milk chocolate, broken into 8 pieces</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 egg yolk</p>

  <p class="ing2">2 tbsp milk</p>

  <p class="para">Line a 20cm/8-inch diameter round cake tin with greaseproof (waxed) paper.</p>

  <p class="para">Put the flour, yeast, sugar, salt, cinnamon and 4 eggs in a mixer and whizz for 10 minutes. With the mixer still on, gradually add the butter and continue to whizz for another 5 minutes. Switch the machine off, transfer the mixture into a bowl, cover with clingfilm (plastic wrap) and leave to rest in a warm place for 2 hours.</p>

  <p class="para">The mixture will be quite sticky; however, form it into 8 equal balls. Insert a piece of chocolate into the centre of each ball, making sure the chocolate is completely covered with dough. Place the balls in the prepared cake tin, cover with clingfilm and leave to rest for 2 hours.</p>

  <p class="para">Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas mark 4. Combine the egg yolk and milk and brush over the top of the brioche. Bake for about 25 minutes, until golden brown. Leave to cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then turn out and break off the pieces.</p>
