<p class="noindent">When you are obsessed with food, fresh ingredients are a must and you will go to absurd lengths to get them. As Gianni recounts, “When I am in Italy in the late summer, I drive an hour from my home to a village, Lamon, known for wonderful fresh and dried beans. Along the streets and roadsides old men sit beneath market umbrellas selling beans and potatoes on stands they construct from upturned vegetable crates. Between selecting beans at two or three different stands and talking with the old men, a simple task becomes an all-day excursion.”</p>
<p class="indentb">For this recipe, which Gianni created, he recommends cooking the beans separately from the vegetables so the beans do not become overcooked and muddy the crisp flavors of the other vegetables. If possible, use shelled fresh beans, both for their flavor and because they take less time to cook. However, dried beans can be used in this recipe and may be purchased anywhere at any time of year. Gianni favors cranberry beans (called <span class="txit">borlotti</span> in Italy), but pinto or white beans will do as well. This soup may be prepared several hours in advance. Combine and heat through just before serving.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups dried cranberry beans, or pinto beans or white beans such as cannellini</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">12 cups chicken broth or water</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 clove garlic, lightly crushed</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh sage leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup thinly sliced celery (about 1 stalk)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup thinly sliced onions</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 pound cremini mushrooms, cut into <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub>-inch-thick slices</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">3</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup canned whole plum tomatoes</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cups potato, cut into <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>-inch cubes</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_59"/><span class="red">1.</span> Rinse the beans, removing any stones or grit, and place them in a bowl or saucepan. Fill the pan with water to a level 2 inches above the beans, and allow them to soak for 6 to 8 hours. Drain and proceed with the recipe. (A quick method for soaking beans is to place them in a pot of cold water, cover the pot, bring the water to a boil, and allow the beans to boil for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the beans stand, covered, for 1 hour before draining and proceeding with the recipe.)</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Combine the beans, 8 cups of the broth, the garlic, and the sage in a large pot. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the beans are soft, about 50 minutes. Up to 1 cup of the remaining broth may be added to the beans, <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup at a time, to maintain a constant level during the cooking.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Meanwhile, in a wide sauté pan set over medium heat, cook the celery and onions in the olive oil until soft, about 7 minutes. Add the rosemary, parsley, and mushrooms, and cook, stirring to soften the mushrooms, about 10 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, crushing them with your hands or the back of a slotted spoon as you add them to the pan. Add the potato cubes and cover the vegetables with the remaining 3 to 4 cups chicken broth. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer until the potatoes are soft when pierced with a fork, about 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Stir the mushroom mixture into the beans, season with salt and pepper, warm through, and serve immediately.</p>
