<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">The Murcian meat pie is celebrated as an important part of the local culture, with regional festivals dedicated to it, and it is also famous in other parts of Spain. It is said to be of Arab origin (for me, the cinnamon is the clue). Bakeries and pastry shops make these pies with two different types of lard pastry: a short-crust base and a puff pastry top. The top is crafted in a curious way, with tightly coiled ribbons of thin dough, which come out of the oven as amazing crisp, golden, spiky pastry spirals. Some bakers add crumbled</span> morcilla <span class="italic">(blood sausage), some chopped chorizo; more rarely there is a touch of something sweet like raisins. The artistry did not work in the same glorious way with my store-bought puff pastry, so I made my second pie with a flat top. You can serve it hot or cold.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6 TO 8</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 pound store-bought pie dough</p>
<p class="qun">¾ pound store-bought puff pastry</p>
<p class="qun">1 egg yolk, lightly beaten with a drop of water</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE FILLING</span></p>
<p class="qun">1½ pounds ground veal (there should be a little fat)</p>
<p class="qun">1 garlic clove, crushed to a paste</p>
<p class="qun">Salt and pepper</p>
<p class="qun">1 teaspoon cinnamon</p>
<p class="qun">¼ pound sliced <span class="italic">jamón serrano</span> or prosciutto, finely chopped</p>
<p class="qun">2 ounces cooked chorizo, chopped</p>
<p class="qun1">4 hard-boiled eggs, cut into thin wedges</p>
<p class="recsum">Butter a 10-inch tart pan or mold. Roll out the pie dough on a floured surface with a floured rolling pin so that it is large enough to line the mold or pan. Trim the excess dough by cutting around the edges with a knife.</p>
<p class="recsum1">For the filling, put the veal in a bowl. Add the garlic, some salt and pepper, the cinnamon, and the <span class="italic">jamón</span> or prosciutto and mix well, working it with your hands into a soft paste. Spread the filling evenly in the dough. Sprinkle with the chopped chorizo, arrange the hard-boiled eggs on top, and dust lightly with salt.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Roll out the puff pastry dough on a floured surface with a floured rolling pin to a round about 10½ inches in diameter. Lift it up by rolling it onto the rolling pin, then unroll it over the filling. Trim the edges with a knife and press the edges of the top and bottom crusts together. Brush all over with the egg yolk, and cut a small steam hole in the middle with a pointed knife.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Bake for 50 to 60 minutes in a preheated 400°F oven; cover the pastry with foil after about 30 minutes, when the top is golden brown and the pastry puffed up.</p>
