<p class="normal"><b>Created in the late nineteenth century, both the name and origin of this dish are disputed, although everyone does agree a girl called Suzette was involved! In my new twist on this classic, we will make a syrup with grapefruit juice infused with rosemary, and you will see how different and delicious it is.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE CRÊPES</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">1¼ cups milk</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 rosemary sprigs</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 cup all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">a pinch salt</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 eggs</p>
<p class="acktxta">2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus extra for frying (optional)</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE SYRUP</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">7 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">grated zest of 1 and juice of 2 pink grapefruit (⅔ cup juice)</p>
<p class="acktxt">leaves from 1 small rosemary sprig, finely chopped</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> To begin the crepes, bring the milk to a boil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the rosemary sprigs, then remove the pan from the heat, cover with plastic wrap and leave to infuse 45 minutes, or until just cool. Discard the rosemary.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> While the milk infuses, make the syrup in a skillet over low heat. Add the sugar and cook slowly for a few minutes until it turns to a light golden caramel, then add the butter. When it is foaming, add the grapefruit zest and juice, mix well and bring to a simmer. Cook about 3 minutes until it forms a syrup, then remove the pan from the heat, toss in the chopped rosemary and leave to infuse in a warm place.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> To finish the crepes, put the flour, sugar, salt, eggs and ½ cup of the rosemary-infused milk in a bowl. Add the melted butter and beat, using an electric mixer, until smooth, then whisk in the remaining milk until smooth, runny and lump-free. Adding the milk gradually means there is not any need to rest the batter before cooking.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Heat a 6- to 7-inch nonstick crepe pan or skillet over medium heat. If you use a nonstick pan, you won’t have to add butter, although it does make flipping easier if you do. If you are not using a nonstick pan, add a little butter first to keep the crepe from sticking.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> Using a ladle, pour enough batter into the pan to cover the bottom thinly, swirling the pan around to spread the batter, then cook 1 to 1½ minutes until the underside is golden. Now comes the fun part: try to flip it over, or turn it with a metal spatula. Cook 1 to 2 minutes longer until the other side is golden brown. Remove the crepe from the pan and keep it warm, then repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the pan if necessary.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>6</b> Fold the warm crepes in half one at a time, then pick them up with tongs and dip them into the syrup, swirling them around to make sure the crepe is coated, then fold over into quarters and serve immediately. Repeat with the remaining crepes and syrup. If you’re really lucky the last one will be for you!</p>
