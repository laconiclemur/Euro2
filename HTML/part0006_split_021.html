			<p class="rec-intro">Venison is available almost all year round and it’s a great alternative to beef for a family roast. I think it’s best in the winter months and this rich pepper sauce is a classic accompaniment. You need to start this dish well before you want to eat it, as the meat has to marinate for two days. </p>

			<p class="body">To make the marinade, crush the juniper berries, peppercorns and bay leaves in a pestle and mortar and add the olive oil, wine and brandy. Using a larding needle, thread the strips of pork fat evenly through the venison. If you don’t have a needle, make cuts with a long thin knife and push the fat into them with your finger. Put the meat in a plastic bag with the marinade, seal and refrigerate for 2 days, turning and massaging it occasionally. </p>
			<p class="body">To make the sauce, warm the oil in a frying pan and cook the shallots until caramelised. Add the peppercorns and redcurrant jelly and stir until the jelly has melted, then pour in the vinegar and let it boil away. Pour in the wine and port and cook until the liquid is reduced by half. Add the stock and reduce by half again, then pass the sauce through a fine sieve into a clean pan. Season, place over a medium heat and whisk in 2 tablespoons of butter.</p>
			<p class="body">For the garnish, heat 2 tablespoons of the butter until foaming, then add the pears and cook them gently until golden and tender. Drain off a little of the butter, then add the honey to give the pears a gloss and shine. Finish with a squeeze of lemon juice and season with salt and pepper.</p>
			<p class="body">Preheat the oven to 200°C/Fan 180°C/Gas 6 and bake the shallots for 20 minutes, then leave to cool. Remove the skins and cut the shallots in half, then fry them in a non-stick pan with a tablespoon of butter until golden and caramelised. Season. Bring the cream to the boil, add the chestnuts, then blitz in a blender until smooth. Add the remaining 2 tablepoons of butter to add gloss to the purée. Season as necessary. </p>
			<p class="body">Take the meat out of the fridge at least an hour before cooking. Preheat the oven to 230°C/Fan 210°C/Gas 8. Drain the venison, place it in a roasting tin and rub the oil into the meat. Season it well and put it in oven. After 20 minutes, turn the heat down to 200°C/Fan 180°C/Gas 6 and continue to cook for 40 minutes for pink meat. Remove the venison and let it rest for at least 20 minutes before carving and serving with the hot sauce, garnished with the cooked pears, shallots and chestnut purée.</p>
