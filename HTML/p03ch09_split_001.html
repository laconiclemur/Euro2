<p class="summary"><span class="bi">Peasant farmers in Spain kept hens for their eggs—they ate chicken</span> only on festive and celebratory occasions. That is why Spanish chicken dishes are so special. Although there is now intensive farming, and chicken is very cheap, the memory of those times is still powerful. Turkey was brought back from what is now Mexico by the conquistadores and was adopted by the nobility as their grand dish for great occasions. In Andalusia and Catalonia, turkey is still the grand Christmas dish, with extraordinary stuffings.</p>
<p class="summary-ind">Spain is the European country with the greatest tradition of shooting game birds. There are partridge and woodcock, pheasant and quail, duck and pigeon. For centuries, hunting and shooting were noble sports reserved for the aristocracy (laws once made game the preserve of the landed elites), and noble codes of practice still govern the sport. Peasants were not allowed to shoot or even to take birds that had died accidentally, but of course there were always poachers. Now shooting is a national sport, and game cooking has wide appeal. During their season, game birds are on every restaurant menu. Every region has hunting preserves in national parks or on private wildlife estates. There are hunting and shooting clubs and associations, and organized driven-shooting (birds are “driven” over a waiting gun line; a team of “beaters” drives the birds by tapping sticks and using flags to encourage them to fly over the shooters) has become an industry. Some farmed birds are raised naturally in their wild environment—they are hatched in nurseries and very quickly allowed into the wilderness.</p>
<p class="summary-ind">Recipes for cooking game abound in old Spanish cookbooks and in collections compiled by monasteries centuries ago. Wild birds have a rich, strong flavor, but their meat is tough compared with that of farmed game. They have to be well hung and tenderized. The old aristocratic recipes advocated marinating game in wine and brandy and pot-roasting or stewing it, but innovative restaurants in Spain now serve tender, juicy roasted birds, their meat still slightly pink (sometimes almost raw), accompanied by a sauce. The peasant game dishes, which were once clandestine because the game would have been poached, are hearty soups and stews with beans and vegetables, and rabbit and hare dishes, which are still very popular.</p>
<p class="summary-ind">Now that game is on our own supermarket shelves and the prices compare favorably with that of free-range organic chicken, we should be inspired by Spain’s ways of cooking it. The season for partridge is from September 1 to February 1 and you can get squab and quail all year round; and all game birds can be bought frozen.</p>
