<p class="chapterSubtitle">{ <span class="bi-color">ajo blanco con uvas–andalusia</span> }</p>
</div>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">This splendid soup (</span>ajo blanco <span class="italic">means “white garlic”), also called</span> gazpacho blanco<span class="italic">, is widely popular. Proportions vary—some cooks use as much bread as almonds. The soup is usually served with peeled and seeded muscat grapes or, less commonly, with small melon balls. You can use any sweet grapes. I used to peel them, but I stopped doing that and found the result just as pleasing. You can make the soup hours ahead or even the day before.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">In Frailes, I helped Manolo (see page 173) make enough soup to fill a dozen super-size Coca-Cola bottles for a celebration of the Jaén Gastronomic Association. We made it with almonds picked from his trees, which we soaked overnight and then peeled (they popped out easily from the skin). We used the oil from his olives, which he presses in an old converted washing machine—the smallest oil press in Spain. At the feast in Valdepeñas de Jaén, our</span> ajo blanco <span class="italic">was served in small plastic glasses followed by charcuterie, a great paella, and pastries. A band of old men played flamenco and people got up and sang of the pain and the joys of those who worked on the land.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">9 ounces (about 2¼ cups) blanched whole almonds</p>
<p class="qun">3 ounces (about 3 slices) crustless white bread soaked in water for a few minutes, until soggy</p>
<p class="qun">3 garlic cloves, or to taste, crushed to a paste</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">2 drops—no more—almond extract (optional)</p>
<p class="qun">About 3 cups cold water</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">2 to 3 tablespoons sherry vinegar or white wine vinegar, to taste</p>
<p class="qun1">36 or more seedless white grapes</p>
<p class="recsum">Grind the almonds very fine in a food processor. Add the bread, garlic, and oil and blend well. Add the almond extract if you like. With the motor running, gradually pour in enough water to give the soup a light creamy consistency. Season to taste with salt and vinegar. Transfer to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and chill for at least 2 hours. To serve, ladle the soup into bowls, drizzle with oil, and drop 6 or more grapes into each.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATION</span></p>
<p class="summary1">Loli Flores of Seville gave me her recipe for an <span class="italic">ajo blanco de piñones,</span> made with pine nuts instead of almonds. Grind 8 ounces (1⅔ cups) pine nuts with 2 slices day-old white bread, crusts removed, and 2 crushed garlic cloves in a food processor. Add 6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, 2 to 3 tablespoons vinegar, salt to taste, and about 3 cups water and blend to a light creamy consistency. Serve chilled, garnished with muscat or other grapes.</p>
