<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">Manolo (see page 173) took me to Embutidos Luque in Fuensanta de Martos in Jaén, where they make artisanal hams and sausages. Hams and sausages hung from the ceiling like stalactites in a cave, and there were huge piles of salted pigs’ ears and feet in boxes. One of their new chorizos is made with olive oil instead of pork fat. We went on to the family restaurant Estrella, where three ladies, Loli Luque Peragón, Yolanda Luque Garrido, and Igna López Fernandez, cooked half a dozen local dishes for us. After we finished, we went to the kitchen, and they gave me the recipes. This is one of them. I made double the quantity in my paella pan for a family lunch in the garden. When I explained that the potatoes were called</span> a lo pobre, <span class="italic">meaning “of the poor,” my six-year-old granddaughter Nell said, “But we are not poor.”</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 pound waxy potatoes, peeled</p>
<p class="qun">1½ large onions, cut in half and sliced</p>
<p class="qun">¼ cup olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">6 large eggs</p>
<p class="qun1">2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley</p>
<p class="recsum">Cook the potatoes in boiling salted water for 15 to 25 minutes, until tender, then drain. Fry the onions in the oil, in a large covered skillet over low heat, stirring often, until they are soft and their juices have evaporated, so that the oil is sizzling. It can take 25 minutes.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Cut the potatoes into ⅓-inch-thick slices and add them to the onions. Cook, uncovered, over medium to high heat, turning the potatoes and onions with a spatula and adding salt to taste, until they are golden.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Beat the eggs lightly with a little salt. Pour over the potatoes and stir until they have set to a creamy consistency. Serve hot, sprinkled with the parsley.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATIONS</span></p>
<p class="bl-first">• Add 1 green bell pepper, cored, seeded, and cut into small pieces, with the onions.</p>
<p class="bl-mid">• Fry ½ pound cured chorizo, sliced, and about 8 chopped slices of bacon in a little oil in a large skillet, and add them to the potatoes before you pour in the eggs.</p>
<p class="bl-last">• Sprinkle 2 to 3 teaspoons wine vinegar over the potatoes before adding the eggs.</p>
