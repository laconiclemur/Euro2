  <h3 class="h3a">Lamb stew with beans</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">This rustic lamb stew is a perfect winter warmer and a complete meal in one pot. I really like to use dried beans, which need to be soaked overnight and cooked before being added to the stew. However, to save time, you could use canned beans and add them towards the end of the cooking time.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">150g/5½oz/¾ cup dried white kidney beans or cannellini beans, soaked in water overnight</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 onion, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">375g/13oz shoulder of lamb, cut into chunks</p>

  <p class="ing1">40g/1½oz pancetta, diced</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 carrot, diced</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 clove</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 bay leaf</p>

  <p class="ing1">100ml/3½fl oz/scant ½ cup dry white wine</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 tbsp canned chopped tomato</p>

  <p class="ing1">300ml/10fl oz/1¼ cups <a href="part0007_split_013.html#pg32" class="calibre1">vegetable stock</a> – or use a stock cube</p>

  <p class="ing-head">to serve</p>

  <p class="ing2">country bread, toasted and drizzled with extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="para">Drain the beans and put them in a large saucepan with plenty of cold water, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat, partially cover with a lid and simmer for 1½ hours, or until tender but not mushy. Drain the beans and set aside.</p>

  <p class="para">Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large saucepan, add the onion and sweat for about 3 minutes until softened. Add the lamb and brown all over. Add the pancetta, carrot, clove and bay leaf and stir-fry on a medium heat for 5 minutes. Pour in the wine and allow to evaporate. Add the tomato and cook for 3 minutes, then add the stock. Reduce the heat, cover with a lid and cook on a low heat for 2 hours.</p>

  <p class="para">Add the beans and cook for a further 15 minutes. Serve with slices of toasted country bread.</p>

    <p class="box-head">For a slow cooker</p>

    <p class="box-para">Heat the oil in a large deep frying pan, sweat the onion and brown the lamb as above. Add the pancetta, carrot, clove and bay leaf, then the wine, and evaporate as above. Add the tomato, 300ml/10fl oz/1¼ cups stock, salt and pepper. Bring to the boil, stirring, then transfer to a large or medium slow cooker pot, press the meat beneath the liquid, cover and cook on Low for 7–8 hours.</p>

    <p class="box-para">Drain 2 x 380g/13oz cartons cannellini beans (or use about 500g/1lb 2oz cooked dried beans), stir into the slow cooker pot with a little extra hot stock, if needed. Cover and cook on Low for 30 minutes. Stir before serving.</p>
