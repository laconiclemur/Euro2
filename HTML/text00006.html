<em>Beans, a Georgian staple</em>
</p>
<p class="para1">
<strong>The 1990s was a very difficult time in Georgia. It was a period of great unrest and civil war, which resulted in Georgia losing Abkhazia, a beautiful region situated on the coast of the Black Sea. My family had a beautiful holiday home there, where we spent every summer and enjoyed so many happy memories, but suddenly all Georgians were expelled from the region. During this time, Russia cut off all supplies to Georgia and we suddenly found ourselves living with no electricity, water or gas for most of the time. It felt like a return to the Stone Age, but we had to rally round and find new ways of living so that we could survive. We learned to cook on oil burners, and neighbours would gather in each other’s kitchens to learn these new skills and share their own. The shops were empty and basic goods were rationed. Families would start lining up for their ration of bread at 3–4 a.m. and the queues (lines) would snake their way round the streets, with people setting small fires to keep warm. Neighbours would take turns in the queues and despite all of the hardship, this was a time of great unity.</strong>
</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>My grandmother, who had fled from the house in Abkhazia to find refuge with us, would spend her days coming up with new and inventive ways of using the beans or</strong>
 <em>lobio</em>
 <strong>to keep us well nourished, but also trying to keep our appetites stimulated when we had to eat the same food day in and day out. Because of the stress of losing her home, my grandmother became very ill and developed Parkinson’s disease, but no matter how diminished she seemed, she was always her old self in the kitchen. For a few hours every day, food and its preparation seemed to bring her back to life.</strong>

<strong>Serves 4–6 as part of a</strong>
 <em>supra</em>
</p>
<p class="side">3 tbsp vegetable or sunflower oil</p>
<p class="side">4 onions, finely chopped</p>
<p class="side">1 kg/2 lb 3 oz button mushrooms, stalks removed and finely diced</p>
<p class="side">200 g/7 oz/scant 1¾ cups chopped walnuts</p>
<p class="side">1 tsp <em>Ajika</em>
 of your choice (Chilli Paste, see <a href="text00005.html#page_28">here</a>
 )</p>
<p class="side">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="side1">1 handful fresh coriander (cilantro), leaves chopped, to garnish</p>
<p class="para1">Place the oil in a large pan over a medium heat. Once hot, add the onions and cook, stirring continuously, until soft and just starting to turn golden, about 10 minutes. Add the mushrooms to the pan and continue to cook, stirring, until all of the water released from the mushrooms has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and set aside to cool.</p>
<p class="para1">Place the walnuts in a food processor and process to a very fine paste. The paste should be sticky and smooth, but not at all grainy (this can take up to 5 minutes). Place the walnut paste in a bowl, stir through the <em>Ajika</em>
 and season to taste.</p>
<p class="para1">When the mushroom and onion mixture has cooled to room temperature, pour over the walnut and <em>Ajika</em>
 mixture and stir to combine, ensuring that the mushrooms are well coated in the walnut paste.</p>
<p class="para">Place the mixture on a serving platter and scatter over fresh coriander (cilantro) to serve. This can also be made ahead and refrigerated until ready to serve.</p>
