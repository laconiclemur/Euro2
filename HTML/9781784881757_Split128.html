<h1 class="chapter1"><a id="page_223"/>CANNELLINI ALLA GIANCARLO</h1>
<h1 class="chapter">giancarlo’s cannellini beans</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>We often show people how to prepare this store cupboard side dish. It’s so simple but tastes amazing. Either cook the beans from scratch (see <a href="9781784881757_Split28.html#page_44">how to cook beans</a>) or open a couple of tins.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 6 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 garlic cloves, peeled and lightly crushed</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>5 sage leaves, or 2 sprigs of rosemary</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>500 g (1 lb 2 oz) cooked cannellini beans, drained (see <a href="9781784881757_Split28.html#page_44">how to cook beans</a>)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt and freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Heat the oil, garlic and herbs in a pan over a low heat for 3–5 minutes until you can smell the <i>aromi</i> (the flavours); take care they do not burn. Add the beans and some salt and pepper, and stir well. Cook for 5–10 minutes until the beans are heated through. If they start to dry out, add a little stock or hot water. Remove the herbs and garlic, and either leave the beans as they are or crush them briefly with a potato masher. Serve straight away with the oil from the pan.</p>
