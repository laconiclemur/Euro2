  <p class="noindent1"><span class="small">NOT MANY WOULD HAVE</span> thought I would end up a chef. When it came to baking and cooking at home, our kitchen was always ruled by my big brother, Peter. No, I always wanted to be a priest! Imagine a priest finishes each sermon by offering the congregation a new recipe for a Sunday roast with gravy, jellies, and homemade cucumber. Perhaps it still wouldn’t be such a stupid idea to combine cookery and the clergy. I never did become a priest, but I did work as a sexton for few years. I would stand in the doorway and greet all the parishioners before the sermon, and I made sure they rose up when they were supposed to and sat down when they were told to during the service. I was also in charge of the collection. It was a side gig that included some responsibility and I liked that. The fact that the congregation complained about my skirts being too short was something I ignored completely. I just wanted to look nice! For the most part, cooking was notable in my life largely for its absence. Well… except for a few valiant attempts to excel in this area. I remember one time I had decided to surprise my mom, dad, and my brother by baking some fresh bread. Off I went to the local supermarket and bought all of the ingredients I needed for the baking. But when I put the dough in a bowl to rise I realized something awful: damn it, I had forgotten the salt! Back in those days I had no idea that it was perfectly okay to add the salt afterward. Everything just went blank. <a id="page_259"/>Down the dough went into a plastic bag, and I dumped it all into a drawer filled with pajamas, t-shirts, and socks before rushing off to the store again to buy some more yeast and flour. I still had enough time to finish the bread before my mom and dad came home. And sure enough, before they walked in the door, the kitchen was clean and the coffee maker was bubbling with a fresh brew. Everything played out just as I had envisioned! I went to bed happy that night, Mom came in to say goodnight… that’s when I realized the dough was still in the drawer! I laughingly told her about the dough that had no salt, and until she opened that drawer up, all was quiet. But then, she yanked it open and out exploded a doughy mountain of pajamas, t-shirts, and socks—the entire mess spilling out over the side of the drawers and dripping onto the floor. Of course it did—it was leavening in a plastic bag all evening. Dough was everywhere! All Mom could do was laugh and laugh. It’s a hilarious memory we’ll be chuckling over for the rest of our lives.</p>

  <p class="indent">These days, we’ll always bake if we have the time and want to treat ourselves to something special. And of course we make the time to bake for Christmas and for parties. It all comes down to whether or not we feel like it and if we’re not too busy. I do, however, believe that the warm, cozy feeling of baking bread will soon disappear. If we bake in the future, it will probably be for other reasons than making the house feel like a home. These reasons may include saving money and <a id="page_260"/>choosing to make healthier, more nutritious bread so we can know exactly what is in it.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/259-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent">These days, there’s no reason for us to eat anything but delicious bread. In most supermarkets there are shelves of bread made from many varieties of high-quality flour to choose from. Not to mention sourdough, which is slowly gaining popularity among today’s consumers. If you have a sourdough starter in your fridge, you’ll just need to be sure to leave it with the neighbors whenever you’re going away for a few days so it won’t starve. I’ve never managed to keep a sourdough starter alive at home—I always forget to feed it. But with a few basic bread recipes, you’ll do just fine. And luckily for me and everyone else who’s too forgetful to make our own sourdough, you can buy incredible sourdough at most bakeries. Bottom line: the future looks great for bread baking. Here are some of my favorite bread and pizza recipes!</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/259-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_261"/><span class="bold">THINK LIKE TINA</span></p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/260-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">READ THE RECIPE CAREFULLY</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">If there’s ever a time to follow a recipe to the letter, it’s when it comes to baking. For example, it’s essential that you measure the correct amounts for the recipe. If you make a mistake with the measurements, it can completely ruin everything. For the ease of American bakers, some of the US measurements included with the recipes have been rounded slightly. For more precise baking, you may wish to follow the metric measurements.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">CHOOSE THE RIGHT KIND OF FLOUR</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">When you make bread—where you want gluten strands—you want to choose flour with a high level of protein in it, such as Manitoba flour. This will give you elastic and tasty bread. If you’re making a pie crust, you do not want gluten strands, which will make the crust sink into the pan. This is why you should use flour with a low protein level, such as regular wheat flour, when you make pie. You should do the same for short-crust pastry and pancakes. High protein levels would be ¼ oz (12 g) per 3½ oz (100 g) flour.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">COLD OR WARM WET INGREDIENTS ?</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">When you want speedy baking, use wet ingredients that are warm. If you have more time on your hands and want better results, you should use cold wet ingredients. Then let it rise slowly no matter what it says in the recipe.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/260-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">WHAT SHOULD DOUGH BE LIKE FOR IT TO BECOME A GREAT LOAF OF BREAD?</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">The dough should be stringy and rubbery and not too firm. You’ll achieve the best results by working the dough without salt for about 10–15 minutes. Then add the salt and work the dough quickly, but only for a few more minutes.</p>

  <p class="img"><a id="page_262"/><img alt="image" src="../Images/261-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">HEAT THE OVEN A LITTLE BIT HIGHER</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Heat the oven about 50ºF (10ºC) hotter than the recipe calls for. When you open the oven door to put in the bread, you actually let out quite a lot of heat. After 10 minutes you can reduce the heat to its suggested temperature.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">USE A THERMOMETER WHEN YOU BAKE</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Insert a thermometer into the bread, and when it shows 208ºF (98ºC), it is done.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">SEASON THE BREAD</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Substitute the water for the dough liquid with crushed tomatoes or white wine (half water and half wine). You can also add sour milk, yogurt, ricotta cheese, or milk. Or perhaps try some colorful juices, like carrot, red beet, or tomato juice. Beer is always tasty in dark bread. Some classic bread spices are fennel, cumin, anise, and ginger. Use ½ tsp dried spice per every 2 cups (500 ml) of dough liquid.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">LOVELY CRUSTS</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">It’s really delicious to glaze the top of fresh baked bread with coffee or syrup. The crust will absorb the flavor and will become doubly delicious. Store bread standing up, with the cut edge toward the cutting board to maintain the crispy crust, or keep it in a paper bag. Never store bread in plastic bags.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">BAKE WITH FRUIT</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Make sure to soak any dried fruit, such as raisins, figs, or any other fruits that can absorb the moisture of the bread before baking. You can soak them in rum, sugar water, or apple juice. In doing so, you prevent the fruit from drying out the bread during the baking. The same rule applies for baking pastries.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/261-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h2a"><a id="page_263"/>156. Spiced Bread with Butternut Squash Purée</p>

  <p class="noindentl">This bread has a little bit of sweetness to it, and it tastes great with aged cheese. Easy as 1-2-3 to bake; you just stir the dough, place it in a loaf pan, and drop the delicious concoction into the oven. It does take some time to bake, but it’s worth the wait. Go ahead and experiment with different spices. The bread is also delicious with herbs such as rosemary, thyme, or marjoram.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">2 LOAVES</span></p>

  <p class="noindentl">This incredibly fresh-tasting bread is made from a simple bread dough with lemon mixed in. Great for picnics and an absolute must for buffets and any other large gathering. It’s great for everything!</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">2 LOAVES</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ oz (12 g) active dry yeast</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2½ cups (600 ml) cold water</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3 lemons, zest</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">6 cups (1.4 liters) wheat flour</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tbsp salt</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1–2 tbsp polenta</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">FILLING 1: HAM, CHEESE, AND PEPPERS:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">15 slices aged cheddar</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">5 slices ham of any variety (optional)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3 whole pickled peppers, cut into pieces</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ cup (100 ml) chopped fresh tarragon and rosemary</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tbsp olive oil</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">FILLING 2: BLUE CHEESE, NUTS, AND RAISINS:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">5 <span class="italic">1</span><span class="italic">/3</span> oz (150 g) blue cheese</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">⅔ cup (150 ml) coarsely chopped mixed nuts (e.g., walnuts or almonds)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ cup (100 ml) raisins</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Preheat the oven to 450ºF (230ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Dissolve the yeast in a little bit of the cold water. Pour in the rest of the water and stir in the lemon zest and flour. Work the dough in a food processor or by hand for about 10–15 minutes. Add the salt and work the dough for another couple of minutes. Let the dough rise covered for 2 hours (or in the fridge overnight).</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Split the dough into halves and knead each half into a ball. Let them rest for 5 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Roll each dough ball out into a flat cake. Lay the aged cheese slices on top of one of the dough “cakes.” Layer the ham, peppers, and herbs on top of and drizzle with some olive oil. On top of the second “cake,” crumble the blue cheese and spread out the nuts and raisins on top.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   Roll them both up and pinch in the edges to prevent the cheese from leaking out during the baking. Place the rolls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Sprinkle some flour or polenta on top of each and let them rise for another 1 hour under a moist baking towel or plastic wrap.</p>

  <p class="nlist">6.   Put the baking sheet in the center of the oven and reduce the heat to 400ºF (200ºC). To make the crust extra crispy, throw 3–4 tbsp (50 ml) water onto the bottom of the oven and then close the oven door quickly. The steam from the water will make the bread crispy and delicious. Bake for about 35 minutes and let it rest and cool before serving.</p>

  <p class="h2a"><a id="page_269"/>158. Manitoba Baguettes</p>

  <p class="noindentl">In baker’s terminology, this dough is considered “weak” and should not be kneaded. The high protein level of the Manitoba flour makes the baguettes springy and fluffy.</p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">4 LARGE BAGUETTES</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 oz (25 g) active dry yeast</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">4 cups (1 liter) cold water</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 lbs (1 kg) Manitoba flour</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">⅔ cup (150 ml) sourdough starter from flour (1 jar)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1½ tbsp salt</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">½ lemon, zest</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">2 tbsp olive oil</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Dissolve the yeast in some of the cold water. Pour in the rest of the water, and add the flour and sourdough starter. Mix the dough in a food processor on normal speed for 10 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Add salt and lemon zest, and mix on the highest speed for 5–8 minutes or until the dough releases from the bowl on its own. Pour into a greased bowl and let rise covered for about 2 hours.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Preheat the oven to 475ºF (250ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Pour the dough out onto a floured surface. Divide the dough into four long, thin pieces with a spatula. Sprinkle flour on your hands and shape each piece of dough into baguettes. Place the baguettes on a baking sheet sprinkled with flour. Let the dough rest for 10–15 minutes on the baking sheet.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   Bake the baguettes for about 15 minutes until they are golden brown and crispy on top. Let them cool down under a baking towel.</p>

  <p class="h2a">159. Focaccia</p>

  <p class="noindentl">Do not for any reason add any extra flour to this recipe “just to be on the safe side.” The dough is meant to be runny, and the bread will turn out nice and firm nevertheless. I used some lovely cherry tomatoes here, but go ahead and try some pearl onions, roasted garlic, capers, or fresh rosemary. Beautiful focaccia makes a wonderful hostess gift, so skip the bottle of wine next time you’re invited to dinner.</p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">1 LOAF</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">7 oz (200 g) mixed tomatoes, in halves</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">approx. 3½ tbsp cored olives of your choice</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tbsp dried herbs (e.g., rosemary or thyme)</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">a few sprigs of fresh herbs</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tbsp coarse sea salt</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Dissolve the yeast in some of the cold water. Pour in the rest of the water and add the flour. Work the dough with a food processor or by hand for 15 minutes. Add salt and work the dough for another couple of minutes. Cover and let rise for 45 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and grease it with olive oil. Grease your fingers, and press out the dough onto the pan. Press tomatoes, olives, and dried herbs into the dough. Let rise for about 45 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Preheat the oven to 475ºF (250ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Drizzle olive oil onto the focaccia and top with fresh herbs and sea salt. Place the bread in the oven and reduce the heat to 425ºF (225ºC). Bake for about 20 minutes. Let cool.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   Cut the bread into pieces and serve, preferably with some quality cold cuts. Perfect for a buffet meal!</p>

  <p class="h2a"><a id="page_270"/>160. Grissini</p>

  <p class="noindentl">You can buy grissini ready-made in any grocery store. But I think the store-bought options are just too perfect. I think homemade grissini ought to be a little crooked in shape.</p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">APPROX. 24 GRISSINI</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 oz (25 g) active dry yeast</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Dissolve the yeast in the water. Stir in half of the flour, salt, and oil. Stir in the rest of the flour and mix the loose dough. Let the dough rise covered for about 20 minutes until doubled in size.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Divide the dough into two halves and roll them out to ¼–½ inch (½–1 cm) thickness. Use plenty of flour when rolling them, so the dough doesn’t stick. Glaze the dough with water and top with a sprinkling of salt and poppy seeds.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Cut the dough into ½ inch (1 cm) wide strips. Twist them and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Let them rise covered for about 10–15 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   Bake the grissini for about 20 minutes, until they are golden brown in color. If they’re not crispy enough, you can dry them out in the oven. Just turn off the heat and open the oven door, and they will dry quickly. Store in a cool, dry place.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold"><span class="small">A SIMPLE AND TASTY SNACK FOR COCKTAIL HOUR</span></span></p>

  <p class="noindentl"><span class="italic">Buy a jar of whipped horseradish and some slices of smoked ham. Spread the whip onto the ham slices and wrap them around the Grissini. It’s perfect for a cocktail hour. Or chop a bunch of herbs and roll the grissini in them before baking them in the oven.</span></p>

  <p class="noindentl">These scones should be served with lemon curd and clotted cream. Of course, if you’re in a hurry you can cheat and buy store-bought lemon curd and substitute mascarpone cheese for clotted cream.

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">CLOTTED CREAM:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1⅔ cups (400 ml) heavy cream</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">1 tbsp crème fraîche (or sour cream)</span></p>

  <p class="hang_1"><span class="small">LEMON CURD:</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">⅔ cup (150 ml) freshly squeezed lemon juice</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">3 lemons, zest</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">⅔ cup (150 ml) sugar</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">6 egg yolks</span></p>

  <p class="hanga"><span class="italic">5 tbsp + 1 tsp (75 g) butter, room temperature</span></p>

  <p class="han_l"><span class="small">DIRECTIONS:</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1.   Bring the heavy cream to a boil and let simmer slowly until reduced by half. Stir occasionally. When there’s about ¾ cup (200 ml) left in the pot, remove the pot from the stove. Stir in the crème fraîche (or sour cream). Pour the clotted cream into a bowl and let it cool in the fridge.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2.   Whisk the freshly squeezed lemon juice, lemon zest, sugar, and egg yolks together in a pot and bring to a boil while stirring constantly. Let simmer gently for a few minutes until the mixture has thickened. Remove the pot from the burner. Fold the butter into the mixture until the lemon curd is smooth and silky. Cool the lemon curd in the fridge.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3.   Preheat the oven to 425ºF (225ºC).</p>

  <p class="nlist">4.   Mix all the ingredients for the scones, preferably in a food processor. Dollop six pieces of dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and flatten the pieces with your flour-covered hands. With a sharp knife, score an x in each scone. Bake the scones for about 15 minutes, until they turn golden brown.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5.   Serve your freshly baked scones with lemon curd and clotted cream.</p>

  <p class="h2b"><a id="page_275"/><span class="italic">Pizza</span></p>

  <p class="noindentl">I like thin-crust pizzas—not the thick ones that are similar to focaccia. If you want to make a really delicious pizza, great quality ingredients are a must. Another must is to preheat the baking sheet in the oven; this way, the heat rises from the bottom as well. Three flavors are more than enough for a pizza! All of these toppings work just as well on focaccia bread or stuffed in lemon bread.</p>
