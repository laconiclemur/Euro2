    <p class="nonindent">One of the high points in <strong class="calibre13">Milan</strong> is the Brera Gallery, where I always make a point of seeking out Bramante’s <em class="calibre4">Men at Arms.</em> The frescoed figures are so real, each expression different, with light bouncing off wavy hair, lips curled in haughty smirks, and a faint glimmer in the eyes.</p>

    <p class="extract">The <strong class="calibre13">Navigli</strong> quarter is the bohemian side of Milan. Home to photographers, artists, antique shops, and outdoor markets, Navigli is surprising because of the waterways that weave around the old buildings.</p>

    <p class="extract">In <strong class="calibre13">Bergamo</strong>, in the upper city, walk under the Palazzo della Ragione to the Colleoni Chapel, burial place of the famous mercenary soldier Bartolomeo Colleoni. Decorated with intricate carving and colored marble, every nook and cranny is filled with detail to keep your eyes occupied for hours.</p>

    <p class="extract">Many people come to <strong class="calibre13">Mantova</strong> to view, in the Gonzaga Ducal Palace, the Camera degli Sposi, a gorgeous bedroom of newlyweds painted by Andrea Mantegna. The frescoes are breathtaking, rich in color, and filled with the details of Renaissance life. The highlight of Mantova for me is Palazzo Tè, which was the summer residence of the Gonzaga family, known as a pleasure palace for activities such as horseback riding, and also the place for lascivious behavior. The palazzo is the Mannerist masterpiece of Giulio Romano, well known also for his book on sexual positions, <em class="calibre4">I Modi.</em> The frescoes inside the palazzo cover a similar topic.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Castiglione Olona</strong> is a sleepy town on the Olona River. The Palazzo Branda is filled with wonderful frescoes by the early-Renaissance painter Masolino, who was called there to decorate the palace. You will probably be the only people visiting, and much attention will be shed on you by the caretaker. There is an outdoor market here the first Sunday of each month, where you can find old books, antique glass, silver, and other precious objects.</p>

    <p class="extract"><strong class="calibre13">Sirmione</strong> is one of the most romantic spots in Italy, best experienced when there is a low fog on Lake Garda that slowly consumes the peninsula. Originally a Roman settlement (visit the Grotto of Catullus—a great example of a private Roman edifice), the Castle of Sirmione is perfectly adorned with crenellation worthy of a movie set.</p>

    <p class="extract">The fabulous <strong class="calibre13">Certosa di Pavia</strong>, a monastery begun in the fourteenth century, has in its library an enormous number of ancient texts. The façade is so rich in marble sculpture and so blindingly white, it always reminds me of an overdone wedding cake. About five miles outside of town is one of the most charming bridges in Italy, the covered bridge over the Ticino River in Pavia. It connects the historical center of Pavia to the other riverbank, Borgo Ticino. Around the first Sunday in September, Pavia is home to a frog festival, held in outdoor gardens, during which frogs (from the rice fields) are served in every way imaginable.—T<span class="small1">ANYA</span></p>
