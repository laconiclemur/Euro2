<h5 class="h5"><b>Author Acknowledgments</b></h5>
<p class="ack">I would like to thank the following people:</p>
<p class="ack">My entire family, for their support, friendship, patience and love. The team at HHB, especially Heather Holden-Brown, for believing in me, for your valuable support and for setting up this second book. My publishers, Duncan, and to Grace – you are a star. And the rest of the gang at DBP – you are brilliant.</p>
<p class="ack">Janet Brinkworth, for working so hard to help me put the book together.</p>
<p class="ack">The management and my team at The Vineyard for allowing me the time I needed to work on the book and to do the photoshoot. In particular, Anthony Millon, my pastry chef, for giving me lots of tips on my dessert ideas to help make them happen. And to Greig Young for your help in The Vineyard kitchen when I was testing recipes. My supplier, Peter, at Aubrey Allen, for helping me with the gorgeous produce – thank you very much.</p>
<p class="ack">Also Wendy Hobson and Nicola Graimes for editing the recipes and trying to keep me on time (or not!) and for your everlasting patience. Manisha, Yuki and Aya – you are all very talented in what you do. It is always a privilege to work with you and I could not have done this book without you. You are the team!</p>
<p class="ack">And finally, Heston Blumenthal – your foreword is a joy to read, and thank you for being my friend. It is always appreciated.</p>
