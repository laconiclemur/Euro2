 CRAB SUMMER ROLLS</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_pink" id="nad0000806">
<em>Unlike spring rolls, which are wrapped in pastry and deep-fried, summer rolls are wrapped in rice paper and don’t need cooking, which makes them both easier and healthier. They are a feast for the eyes, not just the belly, since the translucent rice paper lets all the crunchy veg shine through, and the more colours you use, the better the rolls look – quite literally a rainbow on a plate. This makes all the difference. The trick to getting these spot on is to prepare everything at the start before assembling.</em>

<span class="pink">
<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Chop all the vegetables and lay them out ready to assemble.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000824">
<span class="pink">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Put the crabmeat in a bowl and mix in the lemon zest. Set aside.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000825">
<span class="pink">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Boil a full kettle of water. Pour some into a shallow bowl – deep enough to entirely dunk one wrapper. Let the water cool a little.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000826">
<span class="pink">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Have ready a chopping board and a plate for your finished rolls. Dunk a wrapper into the warm water, completely submerging it. As soon as you feel it soften, take out and lay it flat on the board.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000827">
<span class="pink">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Place a few coriander leaves at one end of the wrapper. This will be the top of the roll when you are finished, and it’s lovely to see the coriander leaves displayed. Now add a little bit of the onion, remembering that less is more. When laying out the vegetables, keep them within the shape of an 8cm rectangle – too big and you won’t be able to roll the wrapper up comfortably.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000828">
<span class="pink">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Add the mangetout, carrot, pepper and crabmeat, then season. Now fold in the two sides of the wrapper to create two straight edges. Turn over the bottom of the wrapper to completely conceal the crab and veg, then roll the whole thing up, making sure to tuck in the sides as you go, keeping the shape of the roll.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000829">
<span class="pink">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Place on a tray, then repeat with the rest of the wrappers and filling. If you are not serving your summer rolls straight away, leave them in the fridge, covered with damp kitchen paper.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000830">
<span class="pink">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 For the dipping sauce, mix together the lime juice and 1 tablespoon of sugar. Stir well until the sugar has dissolved. Add 1 tablespoon of fish sauce and mix. Taste, adding a little more sugar or fish sauce as needed. You want to balance the flavours so that no ingredient is more powerful than the others.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000831">
<span class="pink">
<strong>9.</strong>
</span>
 Mix in the ginger and as much chopped chilli as you like. Stir, taste and adjust the flavours if necessary.</p>
