  <h3 class="h3a">Cheese focaccia</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">This has to be one of the best focaccia around! It originates from Liguria and dates back to the Saracen raids in the ninth and tenth centuries, when locals fled the coastal areas to the safety of the mountains, where only basic ingredients such as flour, oil and cheese were available. Nowadays in Liguria this delicious cheese-filled focaccia is served warm as street food. Stracchino or crescenza, a soft cow’s milk cheese, is used for this recipe. If you can’t find it in your Italian deli, you can use Taleggio or, for a stronger flavour, dolcelatte. Make sure you stretch the dough as much as you can to get a really thin focaccia. Delicious served hot from the oven with a slice of mortadella.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">500g/1lb 2oz/4 cups strong (bread) flour</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 x 7g sachet of dried yeast</p>

  <p class="ing1">6g sea salt</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra to grease and brush</p>

  <p class="ing1">250ml/9fl oz/1 cup lukewarm water</p>

  <p class="ing1">250g/9oz stracchino cheese, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ing2">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="para">Mix the flour, yeast and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre, add the olive oil and gradually add the water, mixing well with your hands to form a dough. Knead on a lightly floured surface for 15 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rise in a warm place for 1 hour, until it has doubled in size.</p>

  <p class="para">Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas mark 7. Grease a 33 x 30cm/13 x 12-inch baking sheet with olive oil.</p>

  <p class="para">Divide the dough in two, making one piece a little bigger than the other. Take the larger piece and roll out into a roughly rectangular shape, then stretch by hand until it is about 3mm/⅛ inch thick. Line the greased baking sheet with the dough and pinch the edge to raise it to about 2cm/¾ inch high. Dot with pieces of cheese and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper.</p>

  <p class="para">Roll out the other piece of dough to the same thickness. Place over the cheese, pressing down with your fingertips and sealing the edges well. Brush olive oil all over the top and bake for 20 minutes, until golden.</p>

  <p class="para1">Remove from the oven and leave to rest for a couple of minutes, then slice and serve.</p>
