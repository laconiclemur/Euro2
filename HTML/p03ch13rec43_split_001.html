<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Toledo, the old capital of Visigothic Spain and the capital of La Mancha, is also the world capital of marzipan. It is known as the “City of Three Cultures” because Christians, Muslims, and Jews coexisted there for centuries. I was there with María Rosa Menocal, a medieval scholar who wrote</span> The Ornament of the World: How Muslims, Jews, and Christians Created a Culture of Tolerance in Medieval Spain. <span class="italic">She made me aware of the Mudéjar architecture and design in churches, palaces, and synagogues. A specialty of Toledo, the inlaying of gold, copper, and silver thread into metal, is called</span> damasquino, <span class="italic">referring to the city of Damascus in Syria.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Rosa Tovar (see page 285), who sent me this recipe, says there are two ways of making marzipan in Spain. This one, which is used in the two Castiles and in Andalusia, is her favorite. For the other one, common in Catalonia, a sugar syrup is boiled down, then ground almonds are added with a little orange blossom water and the paste is cooked and stirred until it comes away from the sides of the pan. My relatives who came from Aleppo in Syria made marzipan in the manner of Toledo, and those who came from Istanbul made it in the Catalan way.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Marzipan keeps for weeks. You can get your children to roll it into shapes. In Toledo, they shape the marzipan into</span> figuritas, <span class="italic">such as fish, snails, shells,</span> huesos de santos <span class="italic">(saints’ bones).</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">MAKES ABOUT 26 BALLS</span></p>
<p class="qun">2 cups (7 ounces) ground almonds</p>
<p class="qun">1½ cups confectioners’ sugar</p>
<p class="qun">3 drops almond extract</p>
<p class="qun">2 to 3 tablespoons water</p>
<p class="serve1"><span class="bold">FOR THE GLAZE</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 egg white</p>
<p class="qun1">1 tablespoon confectioners’ sugar</p>
<p class="recsum">Blend the almonds and sugar in a food processor. Add the almond extract (be careful not to add more, or the taste will be overpowering). Add the water a tablespoonful at a time and blend to a thick paste (I needed only 2 tablespoons); the oil from the almonds will hold the paste together. Blend to a smooth, soft paste.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Shape the paste into balls about 1¼ inches in diameter by rolling lumps between the palms of your hands until they are firm and compact. Lay them on a baking sheet and let stand in a cool, dry place for 12 to 24 hours.</p>
<p class="recsum1">For the glaze, beat the egg white with an electric mixer until firm, then add the sugar and beat until thick and shiny. Brush the marzipan balls with the glaze and put them under a preheated broiler for 1 minute, until the tops are lightly browned, or bake in a preheated 400°F oven for 2 minutes. Let cool.</p>
