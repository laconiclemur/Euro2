<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Being Finnish</a>
</h1>
<p class="pf">We were Finns and almost everybody else we knew was a <i>toiskielinen,</i>
 or a person of “another tongue.”</p>
<p>Our closest neighbor, a quarter mile away from where our driveway started, lived on the corner where we caught the school bus. It wasn’t a corner at all. It’s the dead end of what is now called Benson Road, named after the people who bought the farm from my parents in 1962.</p>
<p>Our neighbors were a combination of one hundred percent Norwegian and German (or Pennsylvania Dutch) and Mennonites. Instead of going to the Lutheran church that we attended, the neighbors went to the Bible Chapel in Floodwood—an amalgamation of various fundamental groups in the area. They often alluded to the fact that we were condemned to hell if we didn’t repent and be saved. This was an idea that puzzled me.</p>
<p>We thought they were nice people, but later we found out that the neighbor kids had been instructed not to associate with our family because we were heathens, and I suppose they thought our evil ways would rub off on them. Or something like that. It was a funny thing, but they never hesitated to ask for help when they needed it.</p>
<p>The mother of our closest neighbor family, the Mennonites, almost always wore a “huivi” wrapped around her head. Or, that’s what we Finns called the cotton scarf that she wrapped tightly and knotted just below her hairline on the back of her head. On very rare occasions, she would appear with her long, dark hair tightly rolled up on a rag to make a shiny, smooth rope around her head. It was the style, but they did not want to be too worldly and stylish.</p>
<p>Our neighbors lived a different way from our Finnish standards. Their house was cluttered and had a musty smell, and they allowed cats to run across the big round kitchen table.</p>
<p>I remember once when I was offered a slice of freshly baked bread. The cat had just been shooed off the table, and the bread placed down just where the cat had sat. I can’t remember if I was polite enough to eat that slice of bread, or if I had just remembered something I needed to do and took off quickly.</p>
<p>Most of the time we had to run the quarter mile to catch the school bus, but sometimes in the winter when the bus was late, usually due to bad weather, they would invite us into their house to stay warm. I never really liked it because their house smelled funny, and if they offered me something to eat, like a cookie, I couldn’t touch it. I could just picture a cat licking the cookie dough spoon.</p>
<p>For their summertime bathing, they had a big white bathtub outside under the willow trees that was enclosed in a tent. I don’t know what they did in the winter. Our family always bathed in our sauna on Saturday night, fall, winter, spring, or summer, and though my mother invited the neighbors to sauna, they never came.</p>
<p>“You can’t get clean in a bathtub,” my father used to say. “You’ve got to take a sauna and then scrub yourself all over!” You had to sweat and when you sweated, you could rub off white stuff from your skin. That’s when you were really clean.</p>
<p>“Sauna” was a ritual. We bathed every Saturday night and the night before any important holiday, like Christmas, or if important company came to visit. In the summertime, we had sauna almost every night during haymaking season, just to cool off and wash away bits of itchy dried hay that stuck to our sweaty skin.</p>
<p>The sauna was a separate building away from the house. It had two rooms: the first was the dual-purpose dressing room and laundry where my mother washed clothes on Mondays using a wringer washer. After churning everything in hot soapy water, she fed the clothes through the handwringer into galvanized rinse tubs. Then, after rinsing the clothes by hand, she would again feed them through the wringer, turning them into long, flat, twelve-inch-wide ribbons that had to be shaken out and hung on an outside clothesline to dry. In the winter, the wet laundry would freeze into stiff boards, and by evaporation got almost dry.</p>
<p>We brought the semidry laundry into the house, fired up the wood-burning stove, and placed sadirons on the top to heat up. Sadirons—or sad irons, the name coming from an Old English word meaning “solid”—were used in the days before we had electricity. They were thick slabs of cast iron, delta-shaped and with a handle, heated on top of the stove. These were also called flatirons. After we had electricity, we switched to electric irons.</p>
<p>In our sauna building there was a long, homemade bench in the dressing room that was also used for the laundry. The bench spanned the full length of the room, and that’s where we would sit to cool off after soaking in the belching steam that we created in the hot room, or steam room, of the sauna. The floor of the dressing room was always covered with clean handwoven rag rugs.</p>
<p>Those rugs were all woven by my aunt Martha, who had a loom. Martha used strips of fabric from old clothing. To make the colorful balls, we cut old clothing, sheets, and anything that had outworn its initial use into 1½-inch strips. We would wrap the strips into balls and when we had a basketful, we would transport them to Martha, who then wove them into rugs. It was always fun to try and recognize the patterns in the rugs that came from our old clothes.</p>
<p>The steam room of the sauna had a stove fashioned out of an oil barrel that had pipes through it and that circled into another oil barrel that was made to hold and heat water. The barrel stove was covered with rocks that would heat up from the wood fire. To fill the water barrel, we carried pails of water, pumped from the well near the house. As the water circulated in the pipe through the fire, it would heat up. This took a long time—at least three hours—so we had to have a good, hot fire going.</p>
<p>The steam room had a concrete floor with a drain that was covered with a wooden platform and shelves that we called “lavas” on three different levels. The top level was always the hottest, especially when you threw a ladleful of water onto the hot rocks. This phenomenon is called <i>löyly.</i>
 Because of the steam, only when kids were big enough were they allowed to climb to the top level. We would watch the temperature on the thermometer on the wall go down when the water we threw on the rocks burst into steam, making us feel hotter and hotter.</p>
<p>We all took turns taking our sauna baths. First, we’d bathe the “little kids,” and then the girls went in together and then the boys took their sauna together. We girls never went in with the boys, nor did women bathe with men. The only exception was that husbands and wives usually bathed together.</p>
<p>As we steamed, we’d rub ourselves with Jergen’s soap and wet washcloths. I loved the floral aroma of the soap, especially if it was a “new” bar, just unwrapped. We each had our own pan of water for bathing. Last of all, we would dump ladles of cold water over ourselves to cool and rinse ourselves. Then, we’d go into the dressing room to dry off and put on nightclothes, and run into the house to read the funny papers (the Sunday paper always arrived on Saturday in the mail in Floodwood). Then we’d drink bottles of orange, strawberry, or cream soda that Isä brought from town as our Saturday night treat.</p>

<p>I loved the “Saturday night” feeling because we had spent the day scrubbing the floors, baking bread or a cake, and sometimes some cookies. Saturday was the day to wash the bedsheets and the clean aroma from drying outside was delicious.</p>
<p>Sunday was the day of rest, although it was only once a month that we had worship services—at Uncle Frank’s house. But that is another story.</p>

<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Thin Finnish Pancakes (Lattyja)</a>
</p>
<p class="rpf">Sometimes we call these “flapjacks”—they are very thin pancakes that are quick to make and perfect for a quick breakfast or simple supper. For a dessert, they can be served with berries and whipped cream. Sometimes I use buttermilk in place of milk—that would make them “buttermilk pancakes.” The batter can be made the night before, then refrigerated. If it thickens beyond being pourable, just add more milk or buttermilk.</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpilf">2 eggs</p>
<p class="rpil">1 teaspoon sugar</p>
<p class="rpil">½ teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="rpil">1 cup milk or buttermilk</p>
<p class="rpil">2 tablespoons melted butter</p>
<p class="rpil">1 cup all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="rpill">Butter for the pan</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">In a medium-sized bowl, whisk the eggs, sugar, and salt together. Add the milk, butter, and flour and whisk until smooth. Cover and let stand for 1 hour before cooking the pancakes.</p>
<p class="rp">Heat a heavy skillet or a Scandinavian-style pancake pan, and brush with butter. Spoon the batter into the pan, using no more than 2 tablespoons of the mixture at a time. Cook on both sides until golden and serve hot.</p>
<p class="rpy">Makes about 20</p>
