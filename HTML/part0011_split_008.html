  <h3 class="h3a">Baked rice with peppers, aubergines and tomato</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">A light rice dish slowly baked in the oven together with summer vegetables. You can roast the peppers in advance: place in a hot oven until the skins blacken, remove from the oven and leave until cool; the skins will easily come off. You can also grill the aubergines in advance, either under a hot grill (broiler) or on a hot griddle pan. Once the vegetables are cool, put them in the fridge until required. The <em class="calibre4">timballo</em> can be eaten warm or enjoyed cold the next day.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">250g/9oz/1¼ cups arborio rice</p>

  <p class="ing1">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing1">400g/14oz aubergine (eggplant), thinly sliced, grilled (see above)</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 small yellow (bell) pepper, roasted and peeled (see above)</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 small red (bell) pepper, roasted and peeled (see above)</p>

  <p class="ing1">400g/14oz tomatoes: half roughly chopped, half thinly sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 garlic clove, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">small handful of parsley, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ing1">8 basil leaves, roughly torn</p>

  <p class="ing2">150g/5½oz mozzarella, roughly sliced</p>

  <p class="para">Preheat the oven to 170°C/325°F/gas mark 3. Bring a saucepan of lightly salted water to the boil and cook the rice for 8 minutes. Drain and leave to cool.</p>

  <p class="para">Lightly brush the grilled aubergine slices with olive oil and set aside.</p>

  <p class="para">Roughly chop the roasted peppers, place on a plate, sprinkle with salt and drizzle with olive oil.</p>

  <p class="para">Place the chopped tomatoes in a bowl and combine with the garlic, parsley, basil, a generous tablespoon of olive oil, some salt and pepper and leave to marinate for 10 minutes. Stir in the cold cooked rice.</p>

  <p class="para">Lightly grease an ovenproof dish with olive oil and line with the aubergines. Add half of the rice mixture, followed by the peppers, mozzarella and a few tomato slices, then the remaining rice mixture. Put the remaining tomato slices on top, drizzle with olive oil, cover with foil and bake for 50 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for another 5 minutes.</p>
