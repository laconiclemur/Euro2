 FENNEL, CAULIFLOWER &amp; CHEESE FRITTATA</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_blue" id="nad0002795">
<em>Although there is something quite heart-warming and special about a classic cauliflower cheese, I love nothing better than tampering with recipes, and since being introduced to the dish by a friend, I have tried so many different variations of it. My friend grew up in a traditional English home, a world away from the home I was brought up in, but we love nothing more than to share, exchange and fuse our recipes. The simple addition of fennel really elevates the flavour of the cauliflower and makes this already so versatile vegetable even more delicious.</em>

<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Place a 20cm frying pan on a medium to low heat. Add the fennel seeds and toast them lightly, moving them around every now and again. Make sure they don’t burn. You will know the seeds are ready when they begin to pop. This will only take a few minutes.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002806">
<span class="blue">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Once the seeds are toasted, place them in a pestle and mortar and grind them down.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002807">
<span class="blue">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Heat the grill to high. Put the pan back on the heat and add the oil. When it has heated up, add the spring onions and cauliflower and cook for 3 minutes, until the cauliflower has softened.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002808">
<span class="blue">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Now add the salt and the ground fennel seeds, and cook for a further minute.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002809">

<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Meanwhile crack the eggs into a bowl and lightly whisk. Add three-quarters of the cheese to the egg and set the remainder aside.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002810">
<span class="blue">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Add the egg/cheese mix to the pan and turn the heat up to high. Give it all a good mix, making sure the cauliflower is distributed. Turn the heat down to low to medium, cover and cook for 3–4 minutes, until almost set on top.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002811">
<span class="blue">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Take off the lid. Sprinkle with the extra cheese and place under a very hot grill for 1 minute, until the frittata is set on top and the cheese is golden and bubbling.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002812">

 You could use this as a replacement for cauliflower and cheese in your main meal, if you wanted. Give it a try.</p>
