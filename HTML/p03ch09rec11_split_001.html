<p class="summary"><span class="italic">The queen of the Spanish skies is the fast-flying red-legged partridge. She has always been the queen. Don Quixote relied on shooting one for a meal. When the season opens at the end of summer in Castile, hunters go out in small groups with their hired entourage—loaders who look after the guns, and beaters who thrash the bushes and flush out the birds shouting,</span> “Vamos! Vamos!” <span class="italic">In the past, when hunters brought the birds home, they were cooked and preserved in a vinegar marinade called</span> escabeche, <span class="italic">so that they could be kept and eaten over several months. These days, game butchers are there in the field with refrigerated vans to buy the birds from the hunt organizers.</span></p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Partridge is the item of choice in restaurants in Toledo during the hunting season. El Bohío in Illescas, on the road between Madrid and Toledo, opened just before the Spanish Civil War as a modest</span> meson <span class="italic">(inn) and became famous for its</span> perdiz. <span class="italic">The restaurant is still owned by the same family; but now Pepe Rodríguez Rey cooks modernized and sensational versions of the old dishes of La Mancha, and his brother Diego is the maître d’. This way of cooking partridge is one of the classics. Serve it with roasted or mashed potatoes (page 430 or page 281).</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4</span></p>
<p class="qun">4 small partridges</p>
<p class="qun">Salt</p>
<p class="qun">3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="qun">1 large onion, chopped</p>
<p class="qun">2 large carrots, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="qun">6 to 7 garlic cloves, sliced in half</p>
<p class="qun">1 cup dry white wine</p>
<p class="qun">1 cup water</p>
<p class="qun">3 bay leaves</p>
<p class="qun">A sprig of thyme</p>
<p class="qun1">12 black peppercorns</p>
<p class="recsum">Singe any remaining partridge feathers over a flame and pull off. Rinse the partridges and salt them lightly.</p>
<p class="summary">Heat the oil in a wide casserole over medium-high heat and turn the birds in it to brown them all over. Take them out, and sauté the onion, carrots, and garlic in the same oil over medium-low heat, stirring often, for about 10 minutes, until the onion is soft. Add the wine, water, bay leaves, thyme, a little salt, and the peppercorns, put in the partridges, and cook, covered, over low heat, turning them over at least once, as the sauce will not cover them entirely, for about 40 minutes, until when you pierce the thickest part of the thigh with a pointed knife, the meat is no longer pink.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATION</span></p>
<p class="summary1">Some cooks like to blend the sauce to a cream. Use a handheld immersion blender after removing the cooked birds.</p>
