<p class="image"><a id="page_94"/><a id="page_95"/><img alt="image" src="../images/05fig00.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent">I once kissed a fish.</p>
<p class="indent">It was in no way a romantic “I love you” kiss, nor a passionate “I want you” kiss, rather a quick, cautious kiss of the kind that is normally reserved for old aunts and remote French acquaintances. But these clarifications do not really make a difference, for it was a kiss. For a split second, my lips were in contact with the cold, wet skin of the fish—before I hastily retreated.</p>
<p class="indent">When I was a child, I loved the fairy tale of the fisherman who caught a talking flounder. As a trade-off for its release, he got three wishes. (As is so often the case with slightly moralizing fairy tales, he got greedy and ended up back where he started.) So when a shouting halibut landed in my boat, I was perplexed. It did not behave as fish should behave, for fish—I have always been told—are not supposed to make any sound. The shouts were low and hoarse, as if from a human trapped in a cave, and for a few seconds its eyes looked almost human. I held the hammer in my hands but <a id="page_98"/>I could not simply end its life without knowing for sure that it was not in fact something more than a fish. As my more cynical fishing companions were busy pulling in the rest of the net, I tried talking to the fish. There was no reply. That is when I did it: I gave it a quick kiss. The fish responded with another shout, sounding genuinely appalled, then it started flapping violently. When nothing else happened—it did not transform into a beautiful princess, nor did the shouting turn comprehensible—I whacked it on its head and returned to cleaning out the net.</p>
<p class="indent">I have always felt somewhat shameful of my, if not directly indecent then at least not quite seemly, conduct that day nearly fifteen years ago. It was only just lately that I found out that I am in good company, and that my behavior is at least in accordance with centuries of folk mythology. Almost all cultures have seen something magical in the halibut. From the American Indians of the Pacific Northwest to the nomadic peoples living in northern Norway thousands of years ago, the halibut has been regarded as a god-fish. It is even evident in the name: Halibut is derived from <em>Holy but,</em> “the holy flatfish.”</p>
<p class="indent">On the bare rock surface outside Alta in northern Norway, archaeologists have found six-thousand-year-old rock carvings showing fishermen pulling large halibut into small canoes. Next to the carvings of halibut, there are images with strongly erotic subjects, almost pornographic. It is not possible to know exactly what link these early Norsemen, of whom we know very little, made between the halibut and sexuality, but it is evident that hoisting a large halibut into a small canoe was seen as a feat of manhood.</p>
<p class="indent">Even today fishermen in northern Norway will tell you that in order to catch a halibut, you need to have a certain sexual aura, known as <em>hall</em>. <em>Hall</em> is something a fisherman can obtain by having intercourse with a woman the night before he goes fishing. “If it is a good woman, and the sex is satisfying to them both,” one fisherman told me bluntly, “then he will catch a big halibut the next day.” It is the story of aphrodisiac food turned on its head: While prosperous societies where food is plentiful create confidence-building myths about food’s ability to improve their sex lives, the ancient people of northern Norway, living at subsistence level near the margins of what is humanly possible, saw food as much more important than sex. They created another kind of confidence-building myth, one where the aim was to muster the courage to face the dangers of the sea, and in that way secure survival.</p>
<p class="indent">You do not have to be a believer in ancient mythology to see what is special about the halibut. Even the dry facts about the fish are enough to intrigue: A halibut, which can weigh as much as six hundred pounds, starts its life swimming upright like most other fishes, with one eye on each side of its head. When it has put childhood behind it, it lies down on one side, in the halibut’s case, the left side. Slowly but determinedly, the left eye moves over to the right side of the face. The upper side of the fish turns black, and the underside retains its shiny white skin. And as if that were not enough, the halibut has a peculiar air bladder, and when the fish is kept out of water, it sometimes gives off hoarse, insistent shouting sounds—which should not be mistaken for a cry for help or a longing for lip contact.</p>

<p class="image"><a id="page_101"/><img alt="image" src="../images/05fig03.jpg"/></p>
<div class="blue">
<p class="noindent"><small><strong>THIS IS A RECIPE I ALWAYS RETURN TO, A VERY SIMPLE AND TASTY WAY TO STEAM FISH. IT IS GREAT FOR ENTERTAINING, AS YOU CAN PREPARE EVERYTHING IN ADVANCE AND JUST REHEAT THE BUTTER AND COOK THE FISH <em>À LA MINUTE</em>. IT’S JUST AS GOOD SERVED COLD, AND JUST AS EASY TO MAKE FOR SIXTEEN AS FOR FOUR PEOPLE.</strong></small></p>
</div>
<p class="noindents">SERVES 4</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Four ½-pound halibut steaks</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fine sea salt</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup plus 2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup chopped mixed fresh herbs, such as thyme, tarragon, mint, sweet balm, and/or rosemary</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 bay leaves, preferably fresh, finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons dried or fresh marigold (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 garlic cloves, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh tarragon</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 to 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 pesticide-free marigolds for garnish (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Rinse the fish under cold running water and pat dry with paper towels.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Rub the halibut steaks on both sides with 2 teaspoons sea salt. Combine the 1 cup parsley, the chopped mixed herbs, four-fifths of the bay leaves, the marigolds, if using, and the garlic and rub onto both sides of the fish. Place the fish in a deep baking dish, cover, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 24 hours.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Preheat the oven to 400°F.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Pour the wine over the fish and cover the baking dish with foil. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until the fish is opaque throughout and comes away from the bone when tested with a knife.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Transfer the halibut to a platter and cover to keep warm. Pour the pan juices into a small saucepan and reduce over medium heat to about ¼ cup.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Meanwhile, in another small saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of the butter until it bubbles enthusiastically. Add the finely chopped rosemary, thyme, and the remaining bay leaves. Cook for 2 minutes. Add the rest of the butter and let it melt, then add the tarragon, the remaining 2 teaspoons parsley, and the lemon zest. Simmer for 3 to 4 minutes; do not boil. Add the lemon juice, the reduced marinade, and salt and pepper to taste. Strain the sauce and discard the herbs.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Brush off the herbs from the fish. Place a halibut steak on each plate, and place a marigold, if using, on the side. Pour a little rosemary-lemon butter over each halibut steak and serve.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><strong><small>VARIATION:</small></strong> When increasing the quantity of fish, you do not need to increase the amount of wine and herbs accordingly. Use enough herbs to cover the fish and enough wine to cover the bottom of the pan. Bake until the fish is opaque throughout and comes away from the bone when tested with a knife. If you are cooking a large halibut, you should use an instant-read thermometer; the fish is done when the interior temperature has reached 125°F.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindent">When I made this dish on <em>New Scandinavian Cooking,</em> I baked a twenty-pound halibut in the sand, using the same cooking technique used by our ancestors many centuries ago and by New Englanders for their clambakes. While I’ve adapted the recipe for a home kitchen, the ingredients are the same, and the results very similar. Use a good wine, one you enjoy drinking yourself.</p>

</div>
<p class="noindents">SERVES 4</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>One 1½-pound halibut steak</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fine sea salt</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ vanilla bean, split lengthwise in half</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup dry white wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 large egg yolks</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 pounds white or green asparagus, trimmed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Preheat the oven to 400°F.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Rinse the fish under cold running water and pat dry with paper towels.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Place the fish in a small baking dish and rub with sea salt. Scrape out the small black seeds from the vanilla bean with the back of a knife and rub them over the fish. Cut the scraped bean into small pieces and place them on top of and underneath the fish. Pour over the white wine, cover tightly with aluminum foil, and bake for 20 to 30 minutes, until the fish is opaque throughout and the interior temperature reaches about 125°F on an instant-read thermometer.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and lemon juice. Whisk in the melted butter and return the mixture to the pan, whisking constantly over low heat until thickens. Remove the sauce from the heat and whisk for 2 minutes. Set aside in a warm spot.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Cook the asparagus in a large pot of generously salted water until tender but still firm, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain, season with pepper, and cover to keep warm.</p>
<p class="noindentt">When the halibut is done, transfer it to a platter and cover to keep warm. Pour the pan juices into a small saucepan and reduce to ¼ cup.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Cut the halibut into 4 pieces and place on plates. Pour the marinade over the fish, add the asparagus, top with a little hollandaise, and serve.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_105"/>BUYING FISH</h3>
<p class="image"><a id="page_104"/><img alt="image" src="../images/05fig05.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Whether I am in Norway or in the States, I always try to make time to buy my fish at a proper fish market. The best way to ensure that the fish you buy is fresh is by looking and touching—fresh fish should smell pleasantly salty and sweet, not fishy; the eyes should be clear; and the gills should have a healthy red or pink color and not be slimy. However, since inspecting the fish up close is not often encouraged, the second best is to ask questions: Where is the fish from? When was it caught? Has it been frozen? If the person selling the fish cannot answer these questions, the likelihood is that you would not have liked the answers anyway, and if you buy the fish, you should make sure to clean it properly and cook it until well done, not rare.</p>
<p class="indent">If a recipe calls for raw or only semi-cooked fish, ask your fishmonger for sushi-quality fish.</p>
<p class="indent">If you do not have a good fish market where you live, the best alternative is often to buy frozen fish (see <a class="nounder" href="source.html#page_294">Mail-Order Sources</a>). High-quality frozen fish can be very good, but it needs to be defrosted very slowly in the refrigerator. Slow thawing can take up to twenty-four hours, but it is more gentle to the flesh.</p>
<p class="indent">You may from time to time find that your fish market has a variety of fish but not the specific fish mentioned in your recipe—in which case it will usually be fine to substitute another, related fish.</p>
<p class="indent">White lean fish can usually be replaced by other white lean fish, and fatty fish with other fatty fish. The result will not always be the same as intended, but better than if you used the fish called for but of inferior quality.</p>
<p class="indent">Here are a few fish that are interchangeable in most recipes:</p>
<p class="indent">Haddock and turbot.</p>
<p class="indent">Cod, pollock, haddock, and scrod.</p>
<p class="indent">Salmon, rainbow trout, and Arctic char.</p>
<p class="indent">Mackerel does not have any close relatives that can easily be used as replacements, but recipes calling for mackerel are normally good made with other small fatty fish, such as river trout.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Crispy Mackerel with Chanterelles</h3>
<div class="blue">
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_106"/><small><strong>MACKEREL AND CHANTERELLES ARE TWO OF THE BEST THINGS OF LATE SUMMER, AND THE TWO GO VERY WELL TOGETHER. SEASONING FATTY FISH WITH CURRY POWDER IS QUITE COMMON IN NORWAY, AND EVEN MY CONSERVATIVE GRANDMOTHER, NOT NORMALLY A SPICE ENTHUSIAST, USES IT WHEN FRYING TROUT OR MACKEREL.</strong></small></p>
</div>
<p class="noindents">SERVES 4</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Four 1-pound mackerel, cleaned</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fine sea salt</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ lemon, cut into thin slices</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup chopped fresh chives</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup all-purpose flour</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon curry powder</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 tablespoons unsalted butter</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound chanterelles, trimmed and cleaned, or 1 pound button mushrooms, trimmed and cleaned, plus 1 ounce wild mushrooms</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 garlic cloves, crushed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon red wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Rub the mackerel with 1 tablespoon salt. Fill the cavities with the lemon and two-thirds of the chives. In a large bowl, combine the flour and curry powder; season with salt and pepper. Dredge the mackerel in the flour mixture so they are lightly coated.</p>
<p class="noindentt">In a large cast-iron or other heavy skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat until melted and light brown. Add the fish and cook, turning once, for 6 to 7 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue cooking for approximately 8 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through. To test for doneness, insert a metal skewer into the flesh; if it comes out warm, the fish is done.</p>
<p class="noindentt">While the fish is cooking, heat the remaining 4 tablespoons butter in a separate large skillet over medium heat. Add the chanterelles, garlic, and thyme and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the red wine vinegar, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook for 4 to 5 more minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. Remove from the heat. Just before serving, add the remaining chives to the mushrooms.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Place 1 mackerel on each plate, put the chanterelles next to the fish, and serve.</p>

<p class="noindentt">Heat the vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the fish, turning twice, for 5 to 6 minutes, until the bacon is turning crisp and brown and has rendered some of its fat.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Transfer the fish to a baking dish, reserving the fat in the skillet. Bake the fish for 15 to 20 minutes until opaque.</p>

<p class="noindent">Monkfish is undoubtedly the ugliest fish in the sea, and in Norway it was until recently considered inedible—I know people who, in the 1960s, were ahead of their time and were able to get free monkfish every day.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Neither fishermen nor most customers had the courage to deal with a monster like the monkfish, so they never found out that beneath the frightening, slimy gray surface there is a wonderful and tasty white flesh. Nowadays, however, monkfish is held in high regard, and it is one of the most expensive fish in the market.</p>
