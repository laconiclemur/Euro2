<h2 class="h2-a">The Provençal Pantry</h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="smallcaps">A PROVENÇAL KITCHEN</span>, like any other, has to have a well-stocked pantry. I always refer to the recipes here as my stand-bys. Anyone who comes to the school at Le Baou d’Infer will be bombarded with ideas for things that will keep and enhance not just the odd dinner party but everyday cooking, too. To state the obvious, one should always have a few bags of good dry pasta, a box of risotto rice, some dried wild mushrooms, peppers and chillies. On the liquid side, there should be a bottle of good olive oil, maybe also some flavoured with chilli or lemon zest, and bottles of balsamic, red and white wine vinegar, as well as some wine and Cognac.</p>
<p class="normala">With a jar of <em>pistou</em> handy you have the potential to transform a massive range of dishes with very little effort. Almost any savoury preparation goes with <em>pistou</em>. Sardines or mackerel can be grilled and generously brushed with pistou right at the end of their cooking time. Grilled or baked aubergines can be drenched in olive oil, cooked to a soft creaminess and spread with some chopped tomatoes mixed with <em>pistou</em>. And after pan-frying lamb cutlets, just add a few spoonfuls of water to the pan to deglaze the wonderful roasting juices and stir in a spoonful of <em>pistou. Pistou</em> keeps well in the fridge, as do <em>anchoïade</em> and tapenade. These two can be spread on croûtons as a canapé, mixed with goat’s cheese or mozzarella. They also make great informal starters as dips with fresh young vegetables.</p>
<p class="normala">In the freezer, a bag full of herb breadcrumbs, made with half parsley and a little savory or thyme and half bread, can perk up a variety of dishes. You can take a handful at a time and have a crispy coating for a piece of monkfish or cod, or a topping for the famous <em>tomates Provençales</em>. These are just tomatoes, well seasoned, grilled until they begin to burst, and topped with these fragrant crumbs before being grilled again until golden. I never use fresh bread for the crumbs, but dry any leftovers and keep them in an airtight box. Also from the freezer a concentrated cube of home-made chicken stock can be quickly turned into a soothing chicken broth. If a sauce you are making needs some beefing up, a little of this frozen stock will do wonders.</p>
<p class="normala">Both Dijon mustard and balsamic, white wine or red wine vinaigrettes can be made in large quantities. They keep for months stored away from the light in a jar with a tight-fitting lid. The tight-fitting lid is also necessary so you can give them a good shake before use. If you don’t have to make these each time, a wonderfully dressed salad, either on its own or with some roasted or finely sliced raw vegetables (particularly if you have a little mixture of herbs to add) is a doddle, making a delightful, simple and fresh meal.</p>
<p class="normala">Dried orange peel, as you will notice throughout the recipes, is a much loved flavouring in Provence. I’ve only started using it in a tomato sauce over the last couple of years, and along with a little cayenne, it lifts the sauce to another level. It also gives an unmistakable scent to Provençal stews and daubes, from chicken and beef to wild boar, as well as adding a delicately fruity and sweet touch to bouillabaisse. Try grinding up a little with some black pepper, salt flakes and dried thyme, savory or rosemary: this makes a magical seasoning for a fillet of sea bream or a slice of lamb once it is carved.</p>
<p class="normala">Although you obviously need to make it all at some stage, the idea of having a well-stocked pantry is to eat well all the time. Instead of making a little when you need something, make a lot at one time and store it in your pantry, fridge or freezer. So then, when time is limited, the food you cook doesn’t need to have any less flavour, but is put together from and enhanced by a selection of favourite and flavoursome preparations. I’ve even added a wine, some jams and some pâtés…</p>
