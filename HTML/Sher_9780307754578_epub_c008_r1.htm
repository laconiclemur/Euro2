  <p class="nonindent">The German cuisine includes some excellent poultry specialties, most of which came to the country by way of eastern Europe. For some reason which I have not been able to fathom, chicken is not featured very much on the menus of German restaurants, although it is very popular in homes. Less expensive restaurants rarely have more than a chicken broth and perhaps roast or broiled chicken on the menu and often not even the latter. Nevertheless there are some delicious recipes for broilers (Brathühnchen or Brathühner), pullets or young hens (Poularde), fowls and young stewing chickens (Suppenhühner) and capons (Kapaune).</p>

  <p class="indent">Turkey (Truthahn or Truthuhn and also called Puter or Indianer) is increasing in popularity but is far less common than it is here. Goose (Gans) is to the German table what turkey is to ours: the large bird served on the most festive occasions. It is always featured at Christmas and also on November II, Martinmas, the day that honors St. Martin, the patron of drinking and jovial meetings. Smoked goose breast, which is purchased at sausage shops and from delicatessens, is one of the most highly prized delicacies in Germany and is available here in all German neighborhoods.</p>

  <p class="indent">I doubt that any country has a better or wider variety of recipes for duck (Ente or Mastente, the latter meaning a large, especially well-fed duck). I doubt also that any country produces more flavorful ducks <a id="page221"></a>than does Germany and they are much leaner and meatier than ours.</p>

  <p class="indent">In general Germans prefer to braise poultry rather than to roast it. Roasting may produce a crisper skin, but braising results in far more tender and flavorful meat. This is true of duck and goose and most especially of turkey. To braise poultry, prepare it as you would for roasting, stuffed or unstuffed. It may be braised whole, or quartered, though the former is more impressive when you serve it. Melt butter or some other cooking fat in a covered roasting pan and place the bird in the pan on top of the stove. Turn bird carefully as each side becomes a deep yellow color. Do not brown it and do not pierce the skin with a fork when turning. When bird is all seared, place it on a bed of root vegetables and onions, or simply onions alone, add a cup or two of hot stock or water, cover the pan tightly and place it in a moderate oven. Allow 20 to 25 minutes’ cooking time for each pound of meat. Bird should be basted frequently and turned during roasting. The pan can be uncovered for the last 20 minutes of cooking time so that the breast will brown. If you have always thought that turkey was too dry, you’ll find this method of cooking it a revelation.</p>

  <p class="indent">The Germans have devised some wonderful stuffings for poultry and have borrowed others from the countries that surround them, and you’ll also find they have equally ingenious recipes for giblets.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">This is one of the best dishes I have ever eaten in Germany, or anywhere else for that matter. It is a relatively expensive item on the menus of the more elegant restaurants. I’ve never had this dish better prepared than it was at the Hotel Eisenhut in the romantic, walled, medieval village of Rothenburg on the Tauber.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">4 TO 6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>5-pound stewing chicken, preferably a young fowl</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 medium onion</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 carrot, scraped</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ knob celery root (celeriac), peeled and cubed, or 2 stalks of celery with tops</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 small parsley root (petrouchka), scraped</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 or 3 sprigs parsley 5 or 6 peppercorns</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 very small bay leaf</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ teaspoon salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>water or chicken broth to cover, about 1 to 1½ quarts</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 tablespoons flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 egg yolks</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¼ cup heavy sweet cream</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>white wine or lemon juice</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 cups cooked rice</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page222"></a>Wash chicken and cut in quarters or halves. Put in a 3-quart soup kettle or a pot that is tall and narrow so that it will not take too much water to cover the chicken. Add onion, carrot, celery root or celery, parsley root, parsley, peppercorns, bay leaf and salt and cover with water or chicken broth. Bring to a boil and simmer slowly but steadily, uncovered, about 10 minutes. Skim foam off as it rises to surface. When foam no longer appears, cover pot, reduce heat and simmer very gently about 1¼ to 1½ hours, or until largest pieces of chicken are tender and begin to come away from bone. Remove chicken and strain soup through a fine sieve, discarding vegetables. Return 3 or 4 cups soup to pot. Skim fat from surface of soup and keep hot over low flame. Melt butter in a saucepan and when hot and bubbling, blend in flour. Sauté over low heat, stirring constantly until mixture is bright yellow. Do not let it turn brown. Gradually pour in 1 cup hot chicken broth, stirring over very low heat until sauce is smooth and thickened. Stir thickened sauce into rest of stock. Simmer about 10 minutes. Salt to taste. Beat egg yolks with cream and remove sauce from heat. Gradually stir in egg-yolk-cream mixture. Add a few dashes of white wine or, preferably, fresh lemon juice to taste.</p>

  <p class="indent">Remove skin from chicken and cut meat from bones in large, thick slices and chunks. Put chicken into sauce and heat a few minutes, but do not let sauce boil or egg will coagulate. Turn cooked rice onto a heated serving platter. Arrange chicken pieces on top of it, and cover with sauce. You may serve extra sauce in a heated gravy boat.</p>

  <p class="indent">Sliced mushroom caps that have been stewed 7 or 8 minutes in a little butter can be added to sauce the last few minutes of cooking time. A tablespoon drained capers and/or a tablespoon minced parsley is often stirred into sauce before serving and sometimes a dab of anchovy paste is blended in as well.</p>

  <p class="indent">The famed Berlin Fricassee is unquestionably the most elaborate and beautiful of all. It includes diced cooked calves’ tongue, diced cooked sweetbreads, tiny dumplings of veal or pike (see Meat Dumplings, or Fish Dumplings), as well as cooked crayfish tails for which shrimp can be substituted, mushrooms both wild and cultivated, and little golden crescents of puff pastry.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>5-pound roasting chicken</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¼ lemon</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 recipe, Curry Rice butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>cup chicken broth</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 to 3 tablespoons sweet cream</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page223"></a>Wash chicken well, pat dry with paper toweling and rub inside with cut lemon. Prepare rice, cooking until almost done. Stuff chicken with cooked rice, and truss. Rub with softened butter, sprinkle with a little salt and place breast up on rack of small open roasting pan. Pour 1 cup chicken broth into pan. Roast in 350° oven, allowing 20 minutes for each pound of chicken. It should be done in about 1½ hours, or when chicken’s legs can move easily in their sockets. Remove chicken to heated platter, bring pan juices to a boil and stir in 2 or 3 tablespoons cream. Heat a minute or two but do not boil again.</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_5"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>MUNICH GRILLED CHICKEN (Münchner Wiesenhendl)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">Rotisserie-grilled chicken is as popular in Germany as it is everywhere else in the world these days, but in Munich it is even more of a feature than in other large cities. Every few blocks one finds a little shop that grills these chickens and sells them for take-out orders, or serves them on the premises with some potato salad, cucumber salad, pickles and such accompaniments. Münchner Wiesenhendl is the food specialty served during the October Beer Festival and the city’s fairgrounds are fragrant with the scent of the buttered chickens roasting on their spits. The chickens are served split, one to a portion, with crusty rye rolls and new beer.</p>

  <p class="indent"><em>For each serving:</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1-pound broiler, cleaned but left whole</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>6 or 7 sprigs of parsley, preferably the Italian type</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>melted butter</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Rinse broiler inside and out and pat dry with paper towel. Sprinkle inside with salt and stuff with parsley. It is not necessary to close vent, but it’s a good idea to tie legs in place. Brush with melted butter and broil on rotisserie. Baste with butter as broiler is cooking so that it browns evenly and does not become, dry. Broil slowly. Split in half to serve. If you do not have a rotisserie, you can roast a broiler, following same directions. Set oven at 375°, baste broiler frequently with butter and cook 45 minutes to 1 hour.</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_6"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<a id="page224"></a><em>CORNISH HENS, STUBENKÜKEN STYLE</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">One of Hamburg’s greatest specialties is Stubenküken, tiny chickens raised indoors. They are cooked lightly stuffed, then braised in butter with a little wine and stock. The stuffings vary with the cooks, but for special holidays the most elegant is of ground pork, raisins and apples, moistened with good, aged madeira. Since you cannot find real Stubenküken here, substitute Cornish hens, preferably not frozen. The new Purdue Cornish chickens are perfect.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 fresh Cornish chickens or frozen Rock Cornish hens</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>lemon</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ pound ground lean pork</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 cup diced, peeled cooking apple</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons raisins</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 to 3 tablespoons gold madeira</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 strips diced bacon</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 cup well-seasoned chicken stock</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">If birds are frozen, thaw completely. If fresh, clean and singe. Rub inside with cut lemon. Pat dry, inside and out, and rub with salt and pepper. Sauté ground pork in 2 tablespoons butter, until meat begins to brown. Toss with apple, raisins and enough wine to moisten mixture slightly. Stuff hens and truss. Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a heavy Dutch oven or braising pot and sauté diced bacon until it begins to turn brown. Do this slowly so that butter does not burn as bacon is frying. Brown hens on all sides, slowly, turning frequently. When hens are golden brown on all sides, arrange them breasts up in the pot, and add 1 cup hot, well-seasoned chicken stock. Cover pot and simmer slowly but steadily 30 to 40 minutes, or until done. Baste several times during cooking, and if more moisture is needed, add additional hot stock. Remove hens to heated platter, skim excess fat from pan juices and check for seasoning, adding a spoonful or two of madeira if necessary. Spoon sauce over hens when serving.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. The Curry Rice also makes an excellent stuffing.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. For a slightly stronger flavor, sauté ½ small onion, minced, along with bacon and butter. A clove of garlic can be added with stock.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. Squabs can be used instead of Cornish hens, but their meat is considerably darker than authentic Stubenküken and more strongly flavored.</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_7"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<a id="page225"></a><em>VIENNESE FRIED CHICKEN (Wiener Backhuhn oder Backhendl)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">Fried chicken the Viennese way is finished in the oven, where it is baked for a few minutes so that it emerges with a crisp, dry breading. It is a standard favorite throughout Germany.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">2 TO 4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 frying chickens, cut in serving pieces</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>lemon juice</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 eggs, well beaten with a little water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>breadcrumbs</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>lard or vegetable shortening</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>melted butter</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Chicken pieces may be skinned or left as they are. Flatten breast quarters so they will fry evenly. Sprinkle all pieces with lemon juice and let stand at room temperature 1 hour. Pat dry with paper towels. Sprinkle with a little salt and dredge well with flour. Dip into beaten egg until all sides are well coated. Dredge thoroughly with breadcrumbs. Let stand at room temperature with breading 20 minutes before frying them.</p>

  <p class="indent">Heat lard in large skillet. Melted fat should be about 2” deep. Sauté, turning once so that pieces become golden brown on both sides. Once chicken is brown, lower heat and fry 8 to 10 minutes on each side. Total frying time should be about 25 minutes. Arrange chicken in open baking pan. Pour a little melted butter over each piece and bake in 350° oven 10 to 15 minutes, or until breading is very dry and crusty.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATION</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">South German Fried Chicken (Wiener Backhendl, auf süddeutsche Art): Fry chickens in same way but sprinkle with a little ginger, as well as salt and pepper, before breading, and mix breadcrumbs, half-and-half, with grated Parmesan cheese. Finished chicken should be served covered with Mushroom Cream Sauce.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Now a regular part of the national cuisine, this paprika-flavored chicken dish came to Germany via Hungary and Austria.</p>

  <p class="right"><a id="page226"></a><span class="small">4 TO 6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 chickens, broilers or fryers</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 large onion, minced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon sweet paprika</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 cups chicken broth</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 cup sour cream</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Cut chickens into serving pieces and dry thoroughly with a paper towel. Sprinkle lightly on all sides with salt. Heat butter in a large, deep skillet that has a cover. When butter is hot and bubbling, add onion and sauté slowly until very soft but just pale yellow in color. Onions should “melt” and must not brown or they will ruin delicate flavor of sauce. If they do brown, throw them out and start over. Add chicken pieces and sauté slowly, turning frequently so they become bright yellow on all sides. Do not let them brown. Sprinkle with paprika and stir through onions and chicken until all pieces are coated. Sauté 3 or 4 minutes more. Add broth, bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat and simmer until chicken is done, about 30 to 35 minutes. Check during cooking to see if more stock is needed in pan. When chicken is done, remove to a heated platter. Blend flour into sour cream and stir into sauce until smoothly thickened. Return chicken to pan, bring sauce to boil and reduce to slow simmer 5 to 10 minutes. Check for seasoning and serve with cooked noodles or Spätzle.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. A light tomato flavor is a very pleasant addition to sauce. Use 1 cup tomato juice and 1 cup chicken stock, instead of 2 cups chicken stock.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. There is a very good, slightly sharper version of this dish also commonly used in Germany. It is made with bacon fat instead of butter and 1 teaspoon vinegar is added to chicken just after the paprika and before liquid is poured in. Water is used for cooking liquid instead of broth or stock.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. To make Squabs in Paprika-Sour Cream Sauce, birds should be split and then cooked the same way as chicken. They will be done in about 25 minutes.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_9"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>SQUABS, GAME STYLE (Tauben, auf Wildbret Art)</em></h3>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 squabs</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons white vinegar</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 cups water</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and pepper</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><a id="page227"></a><em>2 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 onion, sliced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 carrot, scraped and sliced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 leek, washed and sliced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¼ knob celery root (celeriac), peeled and diced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 stalks celery with tops, sliced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 parsley rooty scraped and sliced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>piece of lemon rind</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons flour</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Clean squabs and rinse inside and out. Mix vinegar with water, bring to a boil, cool and pour over squabs. Marinate from 2 hours to 2 days. Unless you like them very sharply flavored, 6 or 8 hours should be enough. Place in refrigerator while they marinate. Remove squabs from marinade and pat dry with paper toweling. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Melt butter in a 3-quart Dutch oven or casserole and sauté squabs a few minutes until golden yellow on all sides. Remove squabs and add vegetables. Sauté about 5 minutes. Place squabs on bed of vegetables, add lemon rind and 1 cup of the marinade. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat and simmer about 45 minutes, or until squabs are done. Add liquid if necessary. Remove squabs to heated platter, drain off gravy and reserve. Leave vegetables in pot, sprinkle with flour and sauté until flour browns. Pour gravy back into pot slowly, stirring as you do so. Let this boil up and simmer so gravy thickens and becomes smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper and a little vinegar, if needed, to be sufficiently piquant. Strain sauce, heat again and serve over squabs.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Since both these birds are fat and should emerge from oven with a crisp skin and as lean as possible, they are handled in much the same way. Be sure that all pin feathers have been removed and that birds have been singed if necessary. Remove as much fat as possible from inside of goose or duck, especially the heavy fat that is usually found at openings. Rinse well inside and out. If you like, rub inside of bird with a cut lemon or rinse with a little brandy or white wine. Rub inside with salt and pepper and stuff.</p>

  <p class="indent">Truss bird, tying legs and wings firmly in place. Tie extra piece of light cord around middle of bird to facilitate turning. Pierce skin around legs and wings with tines of a fork, to allow fat to drain. Place bird breast down, on a rack, in a large open roasting pan. Pour over it 1 cup boiling water. Place in middle of oven heated to 425° and turn thermostat down to 350° as soon as bird is in. Baste frequently with pan juices, skim off fat as it collects in pan and prick skin several times during roasting. For last 20 minutes of cooking time, turn bird over on its back and remove rack from pan. Baste with melted fat that has been skimmed from the pan, so that breast will brown evenly.</p>

  <p class="indent">To serve duck, cut into quarters. Legs and wings can be cut off if you prefer or quarters can be served intact. Usually a quarter is an adequate serving.</p>

  <p class="indent">When buying a goose for roasting, do not select one over 10 pounds. <a id="page230"></a>Geese larger than that tend to be old and tough and are better for braising. There is a saying in Germany that a goose is a peculiar bird—too much for two people and too little for three. Anyone who has cooked a very fat goose will understand this at once. You may start out with what seems to be an enormous bird and find it almost hollow when you cut into it for serving. A 10-pound goose will serve four people adequately; if you’re lucky and skillful at carving, you can stretch it to serve six.</p>

  <p class="indent">When serving goose to your own family, or on any occasion where informality is acceptable, I would suggest you simply quarter and de-joint it. If you are serving it to guests and want to be a little more elegant, carve off the wings and legs and cut the breast meat into 1”-to 2“-wide crosswise slices, so that each slice is edged by a strip of crisp skin.</p>

  <p class="indent">Do not prepare a goose for guests until you have roasted one or two for practice. It is one of the most flavorful members of the poultry family, and it is worth a little extra effort to learn to cook it perfectly.</p>

  <p class="indent">Any of the recipes for duck in this chapter can also apply to goose, but since the latter is a larger bird, it requires longer cooking. Double the amount of other ingredients in these recipes when you prepare goose instead of the duck that is called for.</p>

If you are using oven broiler, split duck in half, broil and then cut into serving pieces. While duck is broiling, cook vegetables. Heat olive oil in 2- to 3-quart oven proof casserole. Add balance of ingredients, stir together and sauté slowly about 10 minutes, or until vegetables have all softened. Place pieces of duck on top of vegetable mixture, cover casserole and bake in 375° oven about 15 minutes.</p>
