<p class="summary">Paella has a strong emotional charge in Spain. It is a Sunday dish, and its preparation is a social affair that takes place in the open air out in the countryside or in the garden. According to my friend Alicia, cooking paella has become a man’s job, one that does not bring their virility into question—on the contrary, it is a way of showing off their skill.</p>
<p class="summary"><span class="italic">Paella valenciana</span> is the iconic food of Valencia, which became the first emblematic national dish of Spain. What was simply <span class="italic">arroz a la valenciana</span> became known, as it spread around Spain, as <span class="italic">paella valenciana</span>, after the large shallow double-handled pan with a slightly convex base that is used to cook it (<span class="italic">paella</span> means “skillet” in the Valencian-Catalan language). The first paella was born in the rice fields around the Albufera lagoon. It was a communal meal, what the laborers cooked for themselves over a wood fire. They put in what they had at hand: eels, snails, green beans, fresh butter beans, and whatever vegetables were in season, and sometimes chicken or rabbit. Eventually every village in Valencia and neighboring Murcia added all kinds of meats, birds, fish, shellfish, and vegetables to their paellas. With the beginning of mass tourism, paella was adopted by seaside resorts and city restaurants, where it was transformed into gargantuan, baroque dishes with a huge number of ingredients that usually did not taste as good as they looked.</p>
<p class="summary">The fashion now in Valencia and also in Madrid is to use a very thin layer of rice in paellas, ideally, they say, only the thickness of three grains and certainly no thicker than one finger (<span class="italic">un ditet</span>) or one centimeter (a scant half-inch). That is why you need a very wide pan. Paella pans come in many sizes, some large enough to feed a hundred people at a festival. You can cook a paella for two to three people in a large 12-inch skillet, but otherwise you will need a paella pan (see page 120). For four to five people, you would need a 16-inch pan, measured across the top; for six to eight people, an 18- to 20-inch pan. However, you could choose to have a thicker layer of rice, as is common in the north of Catalonia, where it can be up to 1½ inches thick.</p>
<p class="summary">There are two passionately held ways to cook paella. One is to start by frying a <span class="italic">sofrito</span> of onion, garlic, and tomatoes, and any bits of pepper, meat, or seafood, then stir in the rice and coat it with the reduced oily sauce before adding the flavorful stock. The other is to pour in the stock when the <span class="italic">sofrito</span> is cooked and to bring it to a boil before adding the rice. It is perfectly fine, and often better, to cook some of the meat or seafood for a paella separately and then put them on top of the rice to heat through at the end, but it is important not to crowd the pan with too many ingredients (I am afraid I am often guilty of that—my friends expect lots of seafood). It is the rice that is all-important, because it is the rice that carries the flavors of the stock and the <span class="italic">sofrito</span>, and it should not be covered up and hidden.</p>
<p class="summary">Important advice from Lourdes is to always have some boiling-hot stock or water at hand in case you need to add more liquid. Often, at the end of cooking a paella, the rice at the top is a bit hard while it is well cooked underneath. Her tip, in that case, is to cover the finished dish with a damp cloth while it rests for 5 to 10 minutes. The rice needs to cook for 18 to 20 minutes; the grains should be dry and separate when done, and the bottom should have a caramelized crust, called <span class="italic">socarrat</span>.</p>
<p class="summary">Count Ybarra, from whom I learned much about Spanish cooking (see page 412), also had some tips. The stock should never come up higher than the level of the rivets for the handles in the pan, and it should be boiling hot when it is added in. Start over high heat, he said, and then, as soon as tiny “crab holes” appear, lower the heat. If you are cooking a large paella on your domestic stovetop, turn two (or more) burners on, and move the pan around so that the rice cooks evenly and all the way to the edges. In Spain, when a paella is cooked outdoors, a wide, built-in charcoal grill or a special large gas ring with several concentric circles joined to a butane cylinder, which gives the desired spread-out heat, is used. When you hear crackly noises, it means that the famously desirable <span class="italic">soccarat</span> is forming. Use medium-grain Spanish or paella rice. If it is not available, use a risotto rice such as Arborio or Carnaroli. Most people in Spain add a pinch of yellow coloring (see page 453) instead of or in addition to saffron threads to give the rice a bright yellow color. Try the two.</p>
