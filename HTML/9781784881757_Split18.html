<p class="tx2"><b>Tuscany is a land of hunters who love to go out at weekends into the woods and shoot game. Roast game birds are notorious for being dry, but we find this way to cook them results in tender flesh and a tasty stock to boot. Other types of bird such as partridge can also be cooked in this way.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">MAKES APPROX. 1.5 LITRES (3 PINTS 3 FL OZ/6½ CUPS)</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 pheasant (with giblets if you have them)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 white onion, roughly chopped, or large handful of onion peelings</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 carrot, roughly chopped, or the same weight in peelings</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 celery stalk (plus leaves if you have them), roughly chopped</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>8 juniper berries, roughly crushed</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>6 black peppercorns</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>5 parsley stalks (optional)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>3 sprigs of thyme</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 bay leaf</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>200 ml (7 fl oz/generous ¾ cup) white wine</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>3 litres (102 fl oz/12¾ cups) hot water</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Heat the oil in a large stock pot over a medium heat. Add the pheasant, onion, carrot and celery, then fry, turning the pheasant until it is browned on all sides. Add the spices and herbs and stir. Pour in the wine and let it bubble over a medium heat for around 10 minutes, until it has evaporated. Add the hot water and let the pheasant simmer over a low heat for 1–1½ hours until the meat is tender and falls off the bone. Regularly skim the stock with a slotted spoon to remove any foam. When the meat is tender, remove the bird from the stock and put it on a board to cool for 10 minutes. Once cool enough to handle, pick the meat from the bones and use it for the risotto on <a href="9781784881757_Split69.html#page_112">pheasant &amp; leek risotto</a> or the soup on <a href="9781784881757_Split85.html#page_144">pheasant soup</a>, or eat it warm with the salsa verde on <a href="9781784881757_Split75.html#page_123">toasted bread with green sauce</a>. Put the bones back into the pot and cook over a low heat for a further 1½ hours.</p>
<p class="tx">Remove from the heat and strain the stock into a large jug or bowl. I like to use the carrot and celery in a soup or sauce – they seem too good to throw away. The stock can be used straight away or it will keep for up to 4 days in an airtight container in the fridge. Alternatively, freeze for up to 3 months.</p>
