<h1 class="chapter_title" id="h24"><span class="red"><span class="bold">AUTUMN</span></span></h1>
</div>
</div>
<div class="nonindent" id="div4"><span class="dropcaps2line">I</span>t was our first real fall here in Médoc and we were excited about the prospect of finding cèpes. We had bought porcini mushrooms in markets in Paris, at the cost of an arm and a leg, and the thought of foraging for our own in the nearby woods sounded charming and adventurous.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div5">A few mornings later, I set out to look for the mushrooms with a basket large enough to carry at least a dozen big ones, only to come home hours later with an empty basket. My husband took the dogs for long walks in the rain and he, too, came up short. Then one day he proudly brought home a very big, soggy mushroom and placed it on the dining table. The whole family huddled around. It looked ugly and wet, not like the beautiful cèpes of my dreams, but perhaps we could still cook it? Nobody really seemed to want that, but we didn’t want to admit that it was no good either. Later that evening, a worm crawled out of the mushroom, and seconds later the cèpe flew out the window; I wasn’t going to cook anything with worms in it.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div6">In November, when we celebrated my daughter’s birthday, one of her friends’ mothers was boasting about the countless kilos of cèpes she had found in October. She asked if we had frozen ours. It was tempting to say yes, but the truth prevailed and I said that where we lived there simply hadn’t been any this year. She seemed surprised, and when they were leaving, she took a little walk in the garden and almost immediately returned with a mush <a id="page152"/>room. We laughed hard—it was embarrassing but mostly funny. I did, however, decide that this would not happen again.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div7">The next fall, I kept my eyes and ears open. A hushed conversation at the greengrocer’s marked the start of the season for me. The merchant and a customer were talking in subdued voices. “So did you find any?” he asked. “Just a couple small ones,” said the customer, adding, “I heard that Madame X found bags’ worth this weekend.” The merchant peered at him seriously, then looked in my direction, sensing I was in on the conversation, and said, “That’s normal, she’s a mushroom witch.”</div>
<div class="indent" id="div8">When I left the store, I had one thing on my mind—I too would become a witch of the forest. I was so determined to succeed that I ventured into parts of the woods I had never been before, stung myself on countless plants, got lost, and even got a bit scared, but my commitment never wavered.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div9">One morning I set out as usual, but this time I did not return empty-handed. I found my first real cèpe, so beautiful and pure, partially covered by moist, decaying leaves. It seemed a shame to cook it, so I decided to slice it thin and serve it raw as a carpaccio, with a little olive oil, for lunch. Later that day I returned to the forest and that time came home with close to a dozen. It was as if the floodgates had opened, and suddenly there were cèpes everywhere. My conjuring powers even extended to my family, who also started finding cèpes all around.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div10">At first the cèpes graced our big kitchen table, taking their place in the ever-changing still life next to the figs and pumpkins. But after a while, even our appetites could no longer keep up with our hunting prowess and the mushrooms started finding their way straight from forest to freezer. Although I always feel it’s something of a shame to treat them that way, in winter, when I bring them back to life, the flavor they add to my sauces and soups returns me to the forest.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div11">Cooking is always a pleasure for me, but my favorite culinary time of the year has to be autumn. The produce is richer, grander than at any other time. On a cool, dark night, I’ll sometimes be standing by the stove, candlelight flickering in the room, beautiful food laid out all around me, pumpkins, mushrooms, nuts. I might be cooking something with cèpes or snails, calves’ liver, or even pears drenched in red wine, adding herbs and broths, simmering and stirring. At times like those, making dinner feels like something akin to sorcery and I sense a deep connection to everyone who has cooked mysterious and delicious food in their little cabins in the forest.</div>
<div class="indent" id="div12">Autumn really is the season of the witch.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div46">In autumn and winter, we always have lots of pumpkins in the house, and even if we are all stocked up, I often can’t resist bringing more home from the market. I also often receive them as gifts, so you can imagine the mountain of pumpkins that piles up in October. I roast them, make a mash out of them, use them in salads. The most popular pumpkin dish I make is this soup; it’s a firm favorite with the kids. I try my best to cook healthy food for my family, and serving this soup always makes me feel like a good mom.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div68">This is a typical Médocain soup, perfect after a long, hard day’s work in the vineyards during harvest season. I was invited one day to a friend’s château, and this wholesome soup was bubbling away in a huge cast-iron pot in his kitchen. <span class="italic">Soupe des vendanges</span> started in the vineyard kitchens, and it was traditionally filled with enough meat to feed an entire village. It is eaten with copious amounts of bread, and the meat is served separately, with cornichons, mustard, and a tomato. Every winemaking family has its own recipe, each full of vegetables; the key is to braise the meat as long as possible, rendering it <span class="italic">moelleux,</span> soft and tender. A nice glass of red wine, a crisp baguette, and this comforting soup is a good way to welcome autumn.</div>

<div class="textbox_nonindent" id="div96">Some of my favorite moments in the kitchen include assembling herbs into an aromatic bouquet, tying them together with string, and then dropping them into whatever broth or stew they are meant to enhance. If garlic and wine are the tastes of France, then a bouquet garni must be its perfume; it’s a staple in any French kitchen. The assortment of herbs must, as far as I am concerned, always include a bay leaf or two and plenty of thyme; sometimes I add a sprig of sage or rosemary, a bit of parsley for freshness, or oregano if I have it. It’s traditional to wrap everything in a piece of leek green, but truthfully I only do this when I have one handy. When the bouquet garni has given all its aroma to a soup or a sauce, it can be easily fished out and discarded.</div>

As soon as the season starts, I am off in the wee hours, dressed in combat clothing, ready for an adventure in the forest. You have to follow your intuition, have a good sense of smell, and look for clues. The mushrooms are often found near oak trees, although you can’t always count on that. Nothing beats the feeling of coming back home, covered in earth, ferns, and scratches, with a basket filled with cèpes, which would cost a small fortune in Paris. That said, since everyone does not live in Médoc, this recipe can be made with any fresh mushrooms, preferably wild.</div>

But here in Bordeaux, they love, for obvious reasons, to add wine to everything and then call it “à la Bordelaise.” I’m lucky enough to have some snail farmers, the Pions, as friends and neighbors, and while she loves them the Burgundy way, he’s more of a Bordelaise guy. They were generous enough to share their recipe with me some years ago and it’s something we love to have in autumn when there is an abundance of snails. While it’s in many ways a fairly traditional ragoût, with ham, sausage, tomatoes, and wine, the snails give it a very different kind of meaty flavor. I always make lots of extra sauce and freeze it, then serve it over pasta when the mood strikes me.</div>

<div class="textbox_nonindent" id="div141">Wine exists for two reasons: to drink and to cook with (well, and to drink while you cook with it). I was going to say that the first reason is the most important one and then I changed my mind. Twice. The whole practice of browning meat in a pan and then deglazing the tasty bits would be so much less tasty without wine. The sauces I like the most have wine in them; it deepens the flavor of any dish.</div>
<div class="textbox_indent" id="div142">There is no reason to cook with expensive wine; a simple but drinkable bottle will usually do. Bear in mind, though, that a bad one might spoil your cooking. I tend to cook with wine that costs around 4 to 5 euros a bottle.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div170">I am a real foie gras fan and always have been. When I was growing up in Hong Kong, it was the food that perhaps most reminded me of France. We’d have it from time to time in French restaurants there and all the time at my grandmother’s house in Moissac. And whenever we were invited to houses of my mother’s childhood friends, inevitably they would serve their own homemade <span class="italic">terrine de foie gras;</span> in the Sud-Ouest, everybody has geese.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent" id="div171">In Médoc, I like to serve foie gras with figs on toast when we have guests. It’s so easy to make and, may I say it, economical there. In Paris, my local charcuterie made a dreamy <span class="italic">foie gras maison</span> with Armagnac in it, so I add some to mine, too. An elegant way of serving foie gras is on <span class="italic">pain d’epice</span> (spice bread) with a glass of Sauternes; while I like it that way, my favorite way to eat it is on toasted Poilâne sourdough bread, sprinkled with salt and pepper, with well-chilled Champagne.</div>

<div class="method_step" id="div181">Line a work surface with parchment paper. Gently separate the 2 lobes of the foie gras. Using the tip of a sharp paring knife, remove any veins and nerves along with greenish or bloody bits.

<div class="method_step" id="div182">Split the foie gras lobes and season on all sides with the remaining 1 tablespoon of salt and the pepper. Sprinkle the Armagnac all over. Layer the foie gras into a 3½ × 15½-inch/9 × 14-cm ceramic terrine mold, pressing on the foie gras with the back of a spoon so there is no trapped air. Cover with the terrine lid.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div183">Put the terrine mold in a small roasting pan and fill the roasting pan with enough boiling water to reach halfway up the side of the terrine mold. Bake for 45 minutes. Take the foie gras out of the oven, remove from the water, and let cool for 5 hours.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div184">Remove the excess fat from the top of the foie gras, spooning it into a small bowl, then refrigerate. When the fat has slightly hardened, scoop just enough of it over the foie gras to seal the terrine. Refrigerate, covered, for at least 24 hours before serving. (You can keep the foie gras in the refrigerator for at least 10 days.)</div>

We gather in the house and have a glass of wine, then carry tables, baskets filled with food, and chairs out into the woods. Someone hangs the lanterns, someone else sets up the fire, and it begins.

The winemakers have their own stash, <span class="italic">bien sûr,</span> but the rest of us can buy the branches anywhere—even at gas stations or small delis. In fact, they are so attractive, we always have a few stacks lying around the garden and in the house, just to look at them. And when we use them to grill for our guests, they always say the same thing: “You can really taste the difference.” Some locals claim to be able to taste the difference between meat grilled over vines and that cooked over Cabernet or Merlot branches. Let’s just say I’m not there yet.</div>

<div class="method_step" id="div247">Slice the breasts off the squab. Season the breasts and livers with salt and pepper.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div248">In a large sauté pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over high heat.

Add the squab carcasses to the pan and brown, turning, for about 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to the cutting board.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div249">Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in the same pan over medium heat. Cook the onion, shallots, and garlic until lightly golden and soft, 5 to 6 minutes. Season lightly with salt and pepper and transfer to a large plate to cool.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div250">Heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil in the same pan over medium heat. Cook the cabbage and carrot until almost tender, a few minutes. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a second plate to cool.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div251">Remove any pieces of meat fit for use from the squab carcasses, shred the meat coarsely, and set aside (it’s easier to remove the meat when the squab is slightly cooked). Discard the carcasses. Chop the livers.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div252">Add the cooled onion mixture to the bowl with the meat mixture and mix gently.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div253">Preheat the oven to 400°F/200°C.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div254"><a id="page176"/>Divide the dough in half. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out each piece of dough ¼ inch/0.5 cm thick in diameter. You want a slightly larger base (about 12 inches/30 cm in diameter) and a slightly smaller top layer (about 9 inches/23 cm in diameter). Line a 9-inch/23-cm pie dish with one circle of dough. Trim the overhang to ¾ inch/2 cm.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div255">Add half of the sausage mixture to the pie shell, followed by a layer of half of the cabbage mixture. Arrange the squab breasts on top, skin-side up.

<div class="method_step" id="div256">To make an egg wash, whisk the remaining egg with the cream. Brush the edges of the dough with the egg wash. Cover with the second circle of dough and seal by pressing firmly on the rim of the dish with your thumbs. Cut off the excess dough, reroll, and cut out 5 to 7 leaves to decorate the pie. Press gently into the crust. With the back of your knife, press the dough lightly all around the edges to make a border. Pierce a hole in the center of the pie (I use a chopstick) to make a steam vent. Brush the pie with the remaining egg wash.</div>

<div class="textbox_nonindent" id="div261">A man and his wife are standing in front of the butcher counter, discussing what to cook for Easter. Lamb, of course, but a shoulder or a leg? The butcher thinks a leg is best; the wife is more comfortable with a shoulder. The husband doesn’t want to contradict his wife, but maybe the butcher knows best? He is, after all, the butcher. They take so much time you’d think they were buying a car or a computer. And then, when they reach a decision and you start edging hopefully toward the counter, your own order practically spilling from your lips, they start discussing another meal, something even more complicated. Then you realize you’ll be there for a while.</div>
<div class="textbox_indent" id="div262">Buying meat is serious business in France and, all inconvenience aside, that’s probably how it should be. We are, after all, talking about meat, something that used to be a live animal. I like to know where my meat comes from; I like to know that the animal was well treated. And so I don’t mind waiting.</div>
<div class="textbox_indent" id="div263">A good butcher, like Monsieur Manenti, knows not only how to buy and cut good meat, but also how to handle people. He listens attentively, yet has his own strong opinion. There is a right way to do things, and he knows it. He can be consulted about various recipes, and while he may not be the most creative cook, he can tell you exactly how long a certain cut of pork should be cooked. Once I threw a dinner party and served <a class="hlink" href="Thor_9780804185608_epub_c04_r1.htm#ind625a">Hong Shao Pork</a>. It was a great success, and when I visited my butcher some days later and told him how happy I was with his meat, he had a smile on his face. My guests, all of them his clients, had visited his shop after the dinner and had praised the meal. He was part of that success and was rightfully basking in the praise.</div>

Small, round, almost translucent, and utterly fabulous, they may be the best grapes in the world. Whenever I would see them in August and September at the market in Paris, I’d feel happy and a bit proud; sometimes I would even tell the vendors, “These are my grandmother’s grapes.” The Sud-Ouest region in general is the heartland of foie gras and the home of all things duck. While I don’t have <span class="italic">foie gras poêlée</span> very often, when I do, I want to do it right. And that means with Chasselas grapes and figs.

<div class="headnote" id="div286">A big juicy entrecôte, or rib-eye steak, seasoned with just salt and pepper and cooked over high heat until crusty and juicy, has always had a special place in my heart. Frankly, I didn’t think it could be improved on—that is, until I moved to Médoc. As you may be well aware of at this point, the people of Bordeaux love adding shallots to everything. Here they work wonders and really complement the flavor of the meat. Add a bit of bone marrow, and you are in meat heaven. It’s fine to cook this entrecôte on a regular grill, but if you want the full Bordelaise effect, I recommend adding dried grapevines to the fire so that a hint of Cabernet or Merlot finds its way into your steak. Having this dish without a glass of red wine is a crime!</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div301">Ratatouille with lamb is a classic French pairing. Of course, ratatouille doesn’t have to be paired with anything at all—except perhaps a fried egg, some good bread, and a glass of rosé. But for a big festive meal, ratatouille is only too happy to share the stage with slices of juicy lamb.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent" id="div302">For a long time, I made ratatouille in the simplest, most old-fashioned way, and if I wanted a change, I simply made a <a class="hlink" href="Thor_9780804185608_epub_c02_r1.htm#ind766a">vegetable tian</a>. That was until I met Gilles de Marcellius, the charming caretaker of Château Ormes de Pez, and added his way of making ratatouille (and roasting lamb) to my repertoire. Although the ingredients are the same, his refined approach leads to a very different outcome; the vegetables retain a bit of texture and crunch (which is why I call this crouquant) instead of practically dissolving into each other. These days it’s my preferred version. Meeting interesting new people is one of the best things in life, and when they give you good recipes, you remember them forever.</div>

I think it’s best to say that it is a dish I would happily welcome at my table anytime. I can’t think of a meal that would not be improved if served alongside Lyonnaise potatoes. Frankly, as I am writing this, I realize I can’t serve dinner tonight without these. That’s how good they are.</div>

Drain in a colander and rinse under cool running water. Let cool for a few minutes, then slice the potatoes into ⅛-inch/3- to 4-mm-thick slices.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div394">In a large sauté pan, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter. Add about one-quarter of the potatoes and fry, seasoning them with salt and pepper, until golden, about 6 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Continue frying the potatoes, adding more butter each time (you should use about 8 tablespoons/120 g in total), until all of them are cooked.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div395">Meanwhile, in another sauté pan, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons/30 g butter over medium heat. Cook the onions until golden, about 5 minutes.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div396">Return all of the potatoes to the pan, add the onions, and mix gently. Cook for 5 more minutes for the flavors to combine.</div>
<div class="method_step" id="div397">Transfer the potatoes and onions to a large baking dish. Bake until gently sizzling, about 10 minutes.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div401">I’m as fond as anyone of a simple steak frites dinner. Sometimes I make a Béarnaise sauce, but sometimes, especially if the wine is good, it’s enough to serve the steak with just a spoonful of Dijon mustard. I always have some greens to go with it, steamed haricots verts or spinach or just a simple salad. Sometimes I have a small steak and lots of spinach. That’s when my husband thinks I’ve read some article and I’m suddenly on a diet. But that would never happen. It’s just that sometimes French fries are … well, not exactly what I am looking for, and then I need an alternative. If it’s pumpkin season, this gratin is one of the best. Steak pairs really well with roasted squash, and this gratin version makes the duo even more satisfying.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div431">Meringues are my absolute favorite dessert, fun to make and a joy to eat. I’m even prepared to go out on a limb and declare that I’ve gotten very good at making them. I’ve gained what I would call meringue confidence. I like my meringues to be slightly soft in the middle, which is the Italian way, and when I eat them, I like to close my eyes and imagine myself wearing a flowery dress and sitting on the stone steps of a beautiful old Italian church.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent" id="div432">When I first made these meringues, I wasn’t going to add any more goodies. But then my sweet tooth and penchant for cream got the better of me, and so while these are good enough on their own, a dollop of cream and a thick chocolate sauce render them simply divine. It’s best to avoid making meringues on rainy days, as the humidity may leave them limp and unattractive.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div524">When I think of my favorite desserts, it seems to me that a lot of them come from Normandy and Brittany, two regions famous for cream and butter, apples, and cider. A great dessert doesn’t need to be overly sugary or sweet, too dressed up or fancy: sometimes just the right amount of flour, eggs, and butter (lots of it), mixed together in a certain way, can lead to magical things. The town of Calvados in Normandy is famous for its apple brandy (they also have a town called Camembert; you may have heard of it), and I always have a bottle at home. It’s great as an after-dinner drink and works wonders in this recipe.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent" id="div525">This rustic dessert is my ticket to Normandy, conjuring up its traditional houses with straw rooftops, windy beaches, black-and-white cows, and apple trees. They say that Normandy has the worst weather in France, but for me it’s truly a beautiful place, one I am just as fond of as the south.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div557">One ingredient I can’t live without is orange flower water.

What I do remember for sure was a packet of <span class="italic">merveilles,</span> little fritters, sold by an elderly woman in the corner of the square. They were so good, on the crunchy side, and perfumed with the delicate scent of orange blossoms. I put orange flower water in madeleines, waffles, desserts—wherever I can (I even dab some behind my children’s ears sometimes)—because the scent brings me back to my childhood.</div>

<div class="method_step" id="div579">We all have our mortal fears: mine is running out of butter. The refrigerator is a bank of sorts, and I don’t feel relaxed unless I have at least two packs of unsalted butter in my savings account. Plus one salty one. Even then I am fidgety—I need more security. More than for cooking, though, I think this has to do with baking. Just the thought of being able, without advance notice or preparation, to bake a cake puts me at ease. The butter in my refrigerator and the eggs in my pantry are part of my investment in future good meals.</div>

<div class="method_step" id="div603">I love having pears on my kitchen table; they age gracefully, the full colors come out, and they never taste better than just before they go bad. I usually try to catch them just at that moment and put them in a cake or tart or simply have them with some nuts, cheese, and a glass of wine. It won’t surprise you that here in Bordeaux they like to drench pears in wine, which makes them very tasty and breathtakingly beautiful. If I were a painter, this is the dish I would paint first. Then I would eat it. (Actually, because I’m such an impatient gourmet, I would probably eat the pears first and then paint them from memory.)</div>
