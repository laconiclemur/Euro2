<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 10 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 1 minute</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 large beefsteak tomatoes, thinly sliced</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 red onion, very thinly sliced</p>
<p class="acktxt">3½oz baby capers in a jar</p>
<p class="acktxt">⅔ cup vegetable oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon sherry vinegar</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 small handful basil leaves, torn</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Put the tomatoes and red onion on a serving plate and season with salt and pepper. Open the jar of capers, strain off 2 tablespoons of the liquid and leave to one side. Take out half the capers and pat them dry very carefully on paper towels.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Put the vegetable oil in a small saucepan over medium heat until just shimmering. Be careful not to overheat the oil—it must not be smoking but needs to be hot enough to fry the capers. Carefully add the dry capers to the hot oil and fry 30 seconds, or until they are nice and crisp. Again, make sure you don’t leave them frying for too long, because they just need to be crisp. Drain the capers on paper towels.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> To make the dressing, whisk together the reserved caper liquid, the extra virgin olive oil and sherry vinegar, then pour it over the tomatoes. Scatter the deep-fried capers over the top, then finish with freshly torn basil leaves.</p>
