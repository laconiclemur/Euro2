<h1 class="chapter_title" id="h1">From Iberia to España</h1>
<h2 class="chapter_subtitle" id="h2">A Glimpse into Spain’s Past and Its Regions</h2>
<p class="nonindent" id="p1"><span class="dropcaps2line">F</span>OR THOUSANDS OF YEARS, the Iberian Peninsula has been the object of desire for many civilizations, all of which have left a permanent imprint on its culture and countryside. The earliest settlers of Spain include the Iberians, the Celts, and prehistoric groups who may be the ancestors of the present-day Basques. But let me start with the Phoenicians, whose traces are still highly visible more than three thousand years later. To cite just a trio of examples of their legacy, they established two major European trading cities in the south, Málaga and Cádiz, still vital today, and they introduced the olive tree, which blankets much of our contemporary landscape. Six hundred years later, the Phoenicians were followed by the Greeks, who ruled Spain, or Iberia as they called it, until their defeat by the Romans.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p2">New rulers, new name: our land became known as Hispania and remained under Roman rule for almost five centuries. In addition to bringing their language, the Romans built roads, bridges, and aqueducts; introduced wheat and the systematic cultivation of the olive; taught us to preserve foods in salt; and established wine making. With the decline of the Roman Empire, Spain became a feudal system of small kingdoms under the control of the Visigoths and Vandals, Germanic tribes who migrated south to expand their territories. During their violent and bloody reign, livestock farming was developed.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p3">Heading north from Africa, armies of Arabs and Berbers, whom the western Europeans called Moors, crossed the Strait of Gibraltar into Spain in 711 AD, where they remained for almost eight hundred years. Spain’s vast south—called Vandalus in the time of the Vandals, and changed to Andalus because the Arabic alphabet lacks an equivalent to the letter V—became a Muslim stronghold. Not only did the Moors bring cultural advances in scholarship, science, architecture, and other disciplines, but they also reintroduced the works of the ancient Greeks, which had been lost to Europeans. Fascinated with water, they developed irrigation systems and planted citrus and almond trees in eastern and southern Spain and on the Balearic Islands. They also introduced such everyday staples as rice, sugarcane, figs, apples, pomegranates, mint, cilantro, saffron, cumin, and cinnamon.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p4">A good-sized Jewish population was already resident at the time of the Muslim invasion, having begun emigrating to Hispania primarily during the reign of Hadrian (117–138 AD). The Jews enjoyed recognition for their industrious character and intelligence, but when they suffered the first anti-Semitic legislation in Spain under the Visigoth rule of King Sisebut, they quickly turned their support to the Moors. The Jews already in Hispania and those arriving from Africa with the Moors played an important role in administration, letters, and science. Jewish and Moorish cultures flourished in Spain: their <a id="page2"/>wise men, including doctors, mathematicians, architects, scientists, and philosophers, greatly enriched the contemporary society.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p5">For centuries, Christians, Jews, and Muslims lived together harmoniously on the Iberian Peninsula, which should serve as an example for the tolerance and compatible coexistence needed today. However, that harmony would end with the expulsion of the Jews in 1492, and the establishment of the Inquisition soon after, an atrocious period forever incised into Spanish history. Pacts made with the Moors of Granada, the last Muslim kingdom in Spain, were broken at the same time, and the Moors were forced to leave or to convert to Christianity. Many basic culinary preferences seen today in some areas, such as the choice of lard over olive oil and pork over lamb, are echoes of the persecution of Jews and Muslims during this time.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p6">These vile actions were initiated during the reign of King Fernando and Queen Isabel, whose marriage in 1469 led to the unification of the peninsula’s two largest kingdoms, Aragón and Castile, in 1479, a union that helped define today’s Spain. The Catholic Kings, as they were known, sought not only to unite their kingdoms, but also to reconquer lands still under Muslim rule, as their treatment of the Moors of Granada illustrates. With the kingdoms united, the monarchs were able to turn their attention to the larger adventures that lay ahead in the Age of Exploration. It was under their rule that <span class="italic">la Pinta</span>, <span class="italic">la Niña</span>, and <span class="italic">la Santa María</span> set sail with Christopher Columbus at the helm.</p>
<div class="fullpageimage_flow" id="div1"><img alt="" src="images/Barr_9781607746157_epub_009_r1.jpg"/></div>
<p class="caption" id="p7"><span class="italic">Moorish arches in Zaragoza, Aragón</span></p>
<p class="indent" id="p8">While Spain’s national treasury was undeniably enriched with New World gold and silver, its culinary stores were equally enriched with the introduction of crops then unknown to the Old World—crops that would eventually change the cooking habits not only of Spain but of the whole of Europe. What would it have <a id="page3"/>been like to cook without potatoes, peppers, corn, tomatoes, or—just imagine—chocolate? The Spaniards, in turn, introduced many Old World crops and livestock to the New World, including wheat, barley, sugarcane, wine, bananas, citrus fruits, cows, sheep, pigs, and chickens.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p9">These were golden times for Spain. It was the center of Europe, serving as the gateway to the newly conquered lands in the Americas. The grandson of the Catholic Kings, Carlos I, ruled the sprawling Habsburg empire and became Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. With the seat of the Habsburgs now in Spain, food traditions traveled back and forth all over Europe, affecting the eating habits of the entire continent. In the mid-eighteenth century, the Habsburgs gave way to the Bourbons, who introduced French styles to the Spanish court and upper classes. Naturally, this had its influence on the culinary habits as well, just as the long Spanish rule of Naples and Sicily can still be seen today in many Sicilian dishes. But the French-Spanish exchange went both ways: it has been said that the biggest loot taken during the French rule of Spain was the collection of recipes belonging to the Hieronymite monks in Alcántara. (As is often the case with neighbors, we are in constant rivalry with the French.)</p>
<p class="indent" id="p10">In modern times, Spain’s rich and diverse heritage was threatened by the Spanish Civil War (1936–39) and its aftermath, the dictatorial rule of Francisco Franco. In addition to the repression of regional autonomy that followed the National Movement victory, postwar Spain was plagued by an economic depression that lasted into the 1950s. Even people who were well-off were deprived of legal access to such everyday goods as coffee, sugar, and tobacco, and black markets flourished to satisfy the demand. People (usually women) living near the borders even left the country to buy products unavailable at home: in southern Andalusia, they crossed to Tangiers or Ceuta in Africa, and in the north, to France. During this period of scarcity, Spanish cooking became more austere. The dishes based on fresh and stale bread or dried beans popular today, such as various soups and stews, were often the sole means of sustenance during that time of shortages.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p11">After nearly forty years of dictatorship, when Franco died in 1975, Spain moved toward democracy and the nation underwent decentralization. In 1979, the former fifty-six provinces, previously ruled with an iron fist from Madrid, were grouped into seventeen autonomous communities, each with its own parliamentary government. Some of them were made up of many provinces, others of just one. For example, the largest of them, Andalusia, included seven original provinces, whereas Murcia, Madrid, Asturias, Cantabria, and La Rioja were each formed from a single former province.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p12">Once Franco’s repressive government was removed, Spain began its race to catch up with more developed countries on the continent. Communities across the country began to reaffirm their cultural and regional distinctions and traditions, sparking a cultural renaissance in Spain that continues today.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p13">During the 1960s and 1970s in France, a group of chefs led by Paul Bocuse, the Troisgros brothers, and Michel Guérard, among others, started the nouvelle cuisine movement, which emphasized fresh, clean flavors in cooking. Their innovations inspired new Spanish chefs emerging from the period of austerity. Luis Irízar, regarded as the father of Basque <span class="italic">nueva cocina</span>, joined the stream in the early 1970s, and many others soon followed, among them Juan Mari Arzak. Still on top of the wave today, Arzak, along with his Basque countryman Martin Berasategui and two Catalan chefs, Ferran Adrià and Santi Santamaría, has been awarded three stars in the Michelin Guide, and he continues to awaken and inspire new generations of chefs. In fact, the race to excellence has been joined by so many talented chefs from every corner of the country that today Spain can proudly claim that its top restaurants are among the best in the world.</p>
<p class="center" id="p14"><img alt="" src="images/Barr_9781607746157_epub_L02_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="nonindent" id="p15">Spain is composed of a spectacular variety of landscapes, from high sierra to miles of coastline to river valleys rich in fruit orchards, vegetable gardens, olive groves, and oak forests. Rather than looking at the regions strictly according to their present political and administrative boundaries, I find it more appropriate in some cases to group them by the shared climate, geography, and natural resources that have shaped and continue to shape their <a id="page4"/>cuisines. For example, although Asturias and Cantabria are separate autonomous communities, I have put them together because the fish of their shorelines and rivers, their meat and dairy industries, their crops and foods, and their recipes have much in common. So, in this manner, following bean stews rather than political boundaries, let us begin our journey though the culinary regions of Spain.</p>
<h2 class="headerA" id="c01-sect1"><span class="red"><a class="hlink" id="ind40a"/>Andalusia</span></h2>
<p class="nonindent" id="p16">Bordered by the Atlantic and the Mediterranean in the south, Portugal in the west, Extremadura and Castile in the north, and Murcia in the east, Andalusia is Spain’s largest autonomous community. It comprises seven provinces with diverse landscapes: there are <span class="italic">dehesas</span>, or large extensions of oak woods and meadows, where the brave bull and the <span class="italic">pata negra</span> (the famed <span class="italic">ibérico</span> pig) live; the Sierra Nevada, a mountain range with snow-covered peaks in the winter only an hour away from the beaches of Málaga; the Sierra de Grazalema, which records the country’s highest annual rainfall, just a few miles from summer resorts with hardly any rain; and everywhere oceans of olive trees.</p>
<div class="fullpageimage_flow" id="div2"><img alt="" src="images/Barr_9781607746157_epub_010_r1.jpg"/></div>
<p class="caption" id="p17"><span class="italic">A black-footed pig on a farm outside Ronda</span></p>
<p class="indent" id="p18">In 756, under Abd ar-Rahman I, Córdoba was established as an emirate aligned with, but independent from, Damascus, which until then had been the center of power of the Islamic world. The Moorish occupation of Andalusia lasted for nearly eight hundred years and left a legacy still visible today. Not only can you see vestiges of those remarkable times in the beautiful palaces and mosques and in the central patios and fountain courtyards in many country homes, but you are also constantly reminded of Arabic influences at the table, even if you only hear the names of local dishes: <span class="italic">alfajores</span>, <span class="italic">alboronia</span>, <span class="italic">alcachofa</span>, <span class="italic">almendra</span>, <span class="italic">albóndiga</span>, and <span class="italic">berenjena</span>, among others. Whether you are eating at home or dining out, sugar-dusted deep-fried churros, <span class="italic">ajo blanco</span> (almond gazpacho), fried fish, pastries such as <span class="italic">pestiños</span> (fried twisted dough brushed with honey), <span class="italic">cabello de <a id="page5"/>ángel</span> (pumpkin preserve), and any number of sweets and savories seasoned with cumin, saffron, or anise reveal the strong Arabic presence in the culinary customs of the region.</p>
<div class="fullpageimage_flow" id="div3"><img alt="" src="images/Barr_9781607746157_epub_011_r1.jpg"/></div>
<p class="caption" id="p19"><span class="italic">Morning view from author’s home outside Ronda, Andalusia</span></p>
<p class="indent" id="p20">The fascination that this region provoked in the many civilizations that conquered it is still present. Andalusia attracts tourists from around the world, and although today they don’t come to conquer, many can’t resist settling here for good. Its extensive repertory of traditional foods, a product of its varied physiognomy and rich mix of cultural influences, is one reason why. In its fertile river valleys, of which the Guadalquivir (“big river” in Arabic) is the largest, dishes like the original gazpacho, <span class="italic">ajo blanco</span>, were invented. An abundance of almonds must have been the inspiration for this delightful cold soup, which combines the nuts with bread, garlic, olive oil, vinegar, and water. (The better-known tomato gazpacho appeared much later, after the discovery of the Americas and the slow acceptance of the New World tomato.) These same valleys supply a wealth of vegetables, including artichokes and <span class="italic">alcauciles</span> (wild artichokes), eggplants, endives, <span class="italic">cidra</span> (a fibrous pumpkin), green beans, fava beans, potatoes, and tomatoes. Most of these vegetables, with the exception of those introduced from the Americas, were first cultivated here by the Moors. Strawberries, or <span class="italic">fresas</span>, came from the New World and are extensively produced in areas of Huelva and Almería, the region’s westernmost and easternmost provinces, respectively; together they constitute the largest supplier of strawberries for the rest of Europe. Along the coast, warm-weather fruits, such as kiwifruits, pineapples, avocados, and mangoes, have found a perfect habitat.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p21">Along Andalusia’s northeastern border, the Sierra Morena, the mountain chain that separates the region from the plains of La Mancha, is covered in holm oaks and maquis of laurel, broom, and thyme. A hunter’s paradise, the rugged land sustains a cuisine of fowl and game <a id="page6"/>dishes, such as <span class="italic">carne de monte</span>, venison stew, and <span class="italic">perdiz escabechada</span>, partridge cooked in vinegar and wine.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p22">Andalusia’s olive trees, which flourish on the rolling hills that lie between the mountains and the flatlands, are responsible for some of the best olive oils in the world and account for 75 percent of the country’s total production. Not surprisingly, this sizable, top-quality olive oil manufactory falls under the country’s rigorous Denominación de Origen (DO) program, a system of quality control that stipulates a product’s origin, production method, specific attributes, and other standards. Andalusia is home to eight different DOs for olive oil, including Priego de Córdoba and Baena in Córdoba Province; Sierra de Cazorla, Sierra de Segura, and Sierra Mágina in Jaén Province; Montes de Granada and Poniente de Granada in the province of the same name; and finally, Sierra de Cádiz in Cádiz and Sevilla provinces—a number no other region can match. Made from many olive varieties, these oils offer an ample spectrum of flavors, and when you drive along the roads that border the olive groves and olive mills, the air is filled with the intense aroma of the oil. <span class="italic">Almazara</span>, Spanish for “olive mill,” is derived from the Arabic <span class="italic">al-ma’sara</span>, which means “press,” another reminder of the centuries of Moorish influence in this part of Spain. Even the Spanish word for oil, <span class="italic">aceite</span>, which refers to any kind of edible oil, whether from olives, almonds, peanuts, soy, or otherwise, is derived from the Arabic <span class="italic">a-zeit</span>, which means “juice of olive,” reflecting the exclusive use of olives for their oil.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p23">The oak woodlands of western Andalusia offer the perfect habitat for the <span class="italic">pata negra</span> (literally “black hoof,” the <span class="italic">ibérico</span> pig), which is made into the unique cured ham of Spain known as <span class="italic">jamón ibérico</span>. The Sierra de Huelva produces some of the best in the country. The <span class="italic">pata negra</span> also is the source of other delightful cured meats, such as <span class="italic">lomo embuchado</span> (also known as <span class="italic">caña de lomo</span>), which is made from the loin and rubbed with <span class="italic">pimentón</span>, salt, and garlic and then air cured, and <span class="italic">morcón</span>, a large, air-cured sausage made from lean pork cuts chopped and mixed with fat and seasoned with <span class="italic">pimentón</span>. The latter is also a specialty of neighboring Extremadura.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p24">Every bar in Andalusia (and most bars in the rest of Spain) offers platters of cold cuts that include these or other similar cured meats. They make a perfect tapa and are often served as a first course. At the other end of the region, in the eastern mountain ranges of Granada, <span class="italic">jamón de Trevélez</span>, another excellent ham, is produced. It is cured for at least fourteen months at altitudes over four thousand feet, and because the pig used in the production of this magnificent ham is a white-coated Landrace, Duroc-Jersey, or Large White, and not the dark-coated <span class="italic">pata negra</span>, the ham is known as <span class="italic">jamón serrano</span>, rather than <span class="italic">jamón ibérico</span>.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p25">The Mediterranean bathes the coast of Andalusia to the sun-bleached town of Tarifa, the most southern point on the European continent. Further west, the waters belong to the Atlantic. Exceptional local fish and shellfish are available in markets and restaurants. Little fish, including anchovies, <span class="italic">chopitos</span>, and <span class="italic">chanquetes</span>, are deep-fried, following the Arabic custom. Indeed, Andalusian cooks are masters of deep-frying, and they cook larger fish, such as marinated <span class="italic">cazón</span> (a member of the shark family), in the same way. These waters are also fished for <span class="italic">urta</span>, a special local red-skinned fish that is usually baked; <span class="italic">carabineros</span>, deep red jumbo prawns of exquisite and intense flavor; <span class="italic">gamba blanca</span>, the white shrimp of Huelva, and <span class="italic">langostinos</span>, prawns from Sanlúcar de Barrameda, both of which are primarily grilled; and <span class="italic">atún</span> (tuna), which has been caught in this strait since Roman times.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p26">The unique <span class="italic">mojama</span>, a dry-cured tuna loin, is produced and celebrated in the fishing villages of Cádiz and Huelva. The only additives in this air-dried delicacy are salt, the sun, and a coastal breeze, exactly as Romans and Moors cured tuna centuries ago. Once the flesh is aged and firm and has turned a deep brownish red, the <span class="italic">mojama</span> is cut crosswise into paper-thin slices and served alone or on a slice of bread drizzled with olive oil. The fishing village of Barbate in Cádiz produces one of the best versions of this traditional preparation.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p27">Andalusian cheeses are made primarily from the milk of sheep and goats, with the only cow’s milk cheese produced in the northwestern corner, near the border with Extremadura. Queso Rey from Ronda, a beautiful and <a id="page7"/>ancient city surrounded by several mountain ranges, is one of the region’s best cheeses. Sheep and goat herding is widespread around Ronda, and the cheeses produced there vary from fresh to medium cured. The same is true for the other cheeses in the region, with the exception of Pedroches cheese from Córdoba, which is medium cured to cured.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p28">Finally, Andalusia is celebrated for its sweet wines from Montilla, Moriles, and Málaga; the world famous sherries from Jerez de la Frontera and Sanlúcar; and the wines from Condado de Huelva, each with their respective DO. But there are also promising new wines being produced in areas such as Ronda, where a group of progressive winemakers are practicing biologic viticulture. The high daytime temperatures combined with considerable overnight drops typical of high altitudes, and plenty of sunshine especially toward harvesttime, make this area ideal for vineyards.</p>

<p class="caption" id="p29"><span class="italic">Tiles inside the Alcázar, Sevilla, Andalusia</span></p>
<h2 class="headerA" id="c01-sect2"><span class="red">La Ribera del Ebro: <a class="hlink" id="ind68a"/>Aragón, <a class="hlink" id="ind982a"/>La Rioja, and <a class="hlink" id="ind783a"/>Navarra</span></h2>
<p class="nonindent" id="p30">If the Nile is Egypt’s gift from heaven, the Ebro is heaven’s gift to La Rioja, Navarra, and Aragón. The Ebro—its name is derived from the Latin <span class="italic">Iberus</span>—is the longest and one of the most important rivers on the Iberian Peninsula. Descending from its spring in the Cantabrian Mountains, the Ebro first crosses La Rioja, where it receives the tributary Río Oja, which lends its name to the region. Then it enters Navarra and shares its waters with both regions, serving as their border until it reaches Castejón, where it turns into a true Navarran river for about a hundred miles. Thanks to its tributaries, the Ebro doubles its water volume in this area where, as the popular saying goes, “Ega, Arga, y Aragón hacen al Ebro varón” (“The Ega, Arga, and Aragón rivers make the Ebro a man”). Be it male or female, the Ebro enters Aragón as a considerable waterway. It then travels another two hundred miles before crossing the border into Catalonia with almost the same volume of water it will have when it joins the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p31"><a id="page8"/>La Ribera del Ebro—the Ebro River valley—is a magnificent, fertile vegetable garden and fruit orchard, supplying the ingredients that constitute the pillars of the local cuisines. Artichokes and white asparagus from Navarra; cauliflower from La Rioja; snow peas from Aragón; and cardoon, borage, leeks, lentils, and Swiss chard, among others, common to all, are everyday ingredients for home cooks and restaurant chefs across the region. Peppers are used extensively in all three areas: <span class="italic">a la riojana</span>, which usually indicates the addition of peppers to any given dish, is almost identical to the <span class="italic">chilindrones</span> preparation in Navarra and Aragón. The renowned Pimientos del Piquillo de Lodosa are grown in Navarra, their quality guaranteed by DO guidelines. But peppers don’t understand borders or laws, and those growing on the other side of the Ebro in La Rioja are also superb, even if slightly larger and lesser known outside the area. Sometimes <span class="italic">piquillo</span> peppers are stuffed, other times they are simply sautéed with olive oil and garlic, but no matter how they are prepared, they are excellent.</p>
<div class="fullpageimage_flow" id="div5"><img alt="" src="images/Barr_9781607746157_epub_013_r1.jpg"/></div>
<p class="caption" id="p32"><span class="italic">The Ebro River flowing past the Basílica de Nuestra Señora del Pilar, Zaragoza, Aragón</span></p>
<p class="indent" id="p33">However, La Ribera del Ebro isn’t the only important common influence on the region’s culinary traditions. La Rioja and Navarra border the Basque Country, which supplies both with excellent fish from the Bay of Biscay, so it is no surprise to find considerable Basque influence in their cooking, and vice versa. Aragón and Navarra border the Pyrenees, and the mountains, rich in game and freshwater fish, have shaped their cuisines in similar ways. <span class="italic">Trucha</span> (trout) and <span class="italic">cangrejo de río</span> (crayfish) are often prepared in the same manner in both areas, the crayfish served in a spicy sauce, with or without tomato (the better known crayfish are from La Rioja), the trout wrapped in cured ham and baked. Throughout the mountainous areas, you’ll find <span class="italic">migas</span>, or bread crumbs, cooked for breakfast. Residents in all three areas enjoy both roasted or stewed lamb (the lamb from La Rioja is <a id="page9"/>usually the smallest), especially <span class="italic">chuletitas al sarmiento</span>, baby lamb chops cooked over a fire of vine cuttings, and a simple dessert of <span class="italic">peras al vino tinto de Rioja</span>, peaches cooked in wine.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p34">El Camino de Santiago, or the Pilgrim’s Trail to Santiago, figures prominently in the common history of the region. Among its mandatory stops where it crosses the Pyrenees are Jaca in Aragón, Leyre and Pamplona in Navarra, and Logroño in La Rioja. A main itinerary for countless pilgrims, the region flourished in the Middle Ages due to the constant influx of cultures. Today, it still has a cosmopolitan feel and remains the primary route for travelers crossing from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p35">Although these areas share many similarities, each also has its local specialties. Chorizos from La Rioja are an essential part of the ubiquitous <span class="italic">patatas a la riojana</span>, a potato and chorizo stew. The delicate <span class="italic">jamón serrano</span> from Teruel, Aragón’s southernmost province, made from common white-coated pigs (usually Landrace or Duroc-Jersey), is memorable, as is the magnificent olive oil produced close by, between the provinces of Teruel and Zaragoza.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p36">Navarra’s contribution to the regional cheese platter is considerable, including Roncal, which is made from the milk of two sheep breeds, Lacha and Rasa, and Idiazábal, a firm, creamy white sheep’s milk cheese ripened in mountain caves (though most of the production of the latter takes place in the neighboring Basque Country). Camerano is a delicious fresh goat’s milk cheese from southern La Rioja. The cheeses of Aragón are mainly fresh and made from goat’s or sheep’s milk, or a combination, with the exception of Calanda and Tronchón, which can be medium cured or cured and have an intense flavor and firm texture. Cow’s milk cheeses are restricted primarily to the Pyrenean province of Huesca, where Benasque and Ansó-Hecho are made, the latter a mix of cow’s milk and sheep’s milk.</p>

<p class="caption" id="p37"><span class="italic">Looking down a pedestrian street to the Basílica de Nuestra Señora del Pilar</span></p>
<p class="indent" id="p38">Locals regularly enjoy their cheeses with wine, so it is fortuitous that wine is also one of the strengths of the <a id="page10"/>region. La Rioja is home to some of the country’s oldest wineries and continues to be one of Spain’s leading wine-producing areas. The wine region known as Rioja doesn’t quite coincide with the administrative one; rather, it is divided into three sectors: Rioja Alavesa, which, as its name indicates, stretches into the Basque province of Álava; Rioja Alta, on the north bank of the Ebro; and Rioja Baja, on the southern shore. Navarra produces great red and white wines, too, and the region’s rosés are considered among the best in the world. It is also the source of <span class="italic">pacharán</span> (<span class="italic">patxarán</span> in Basque), a delicious anise liqueur unique to the area made of <span class="italic">endrinas</span> (sloe berries). Aragón has recently made great strides in the production of high-quality wines. Most noteworthy is the newer but excellent wine from the Somontano DO, grown in an enclave at the foothills of the Pyrenees.</p>

<h2 class="headerA" id="c01-sect3"><span class="red">Asturias and <a class="hlink" id="ind278a"/>Cantabria</span></h2>
<p class="nonindent" id="p40">Neighboring Asturias and Cantabria share the center of the Cantabrian Mountains, which extend from the western end of the Pyrenees, along the coast of the Bay of Biscay, and down to Portugal. Together they form the middle of so-called Green Spain, which includes Galicia to the west and the Basque Country to the east. The Cantabrian Mountains, crowned by the stunning limestone Picos de Europa in Asturias, harbor a number of protected indigenous species, including many birds, among them the large, dark-plumed <span class="italic">urogallo</span>, or mountain rooster; wild goats; and bears. The region is ribboned with rivers descending from the mountains, fishing villages, and good pastureland. Here, the meadows shimmer bright green, sandy beaches alternate with rocky coastline, and fishing boats bring in some of the country’s best seafood from the Bay of Biscay. Despite its incredible beauty, this area is still largely rural and does not see many tourists.</p>

<p class="indent" id="p42">Asturias and Cantabria are well known for their seafood. <span class="italic">Percebes</span> (gooseneck barnacles), <span class="italic">mejillones</span> (mussels), <span class="italic">almejas</span> (clams), <span class="italic">caracolillos</span> (snails), and <span class="italic">navajas</span> (razor clams) are among the delicious mollusks found in these cold waters. Prices range from astronomical for gooseneck barnacles to modest for snails. Crustaceans are equally fresh and varied: <span class="italic">langosta</span> (spiny lobster), <span class="italic">bogavante</span> (lobster), <span class="italic">cigala</span> (langoustine, not to be confused with <span class="italic">langostino</span>, which is a prawn), and <span class="italic">nécora</span> (hard-shell crab, known as <span class="italic">andarica</span> in Asturias). <span class="italic">Erizos de mar</span> (sea urchins) are eaten raw directly from of the shell with a little lemon or broiled with a creamy sauce. Although becoming more scarce, <span class="italic">angulas</span> (baby eels) are still caught at the mouths of local rivers. Sautéed with olive oil, a little garlic, and a pinch of hot pepper, they are one of the region’s great delicacies.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p43">Fresh <span class="italic">anchoas</span> (anchovies) and <span class="italic">sardinas</span> (sardines) are abundant here and of exceptional quality. That bounty is what drew a group of Italian anchovy merchants to Laredo and Santoña toward the end of the nineteenth century. They launched a canning industry, which soon flourished, and today it turns out some of the finest canned anchovies and <span class="italic">ventresca de bonito o atún</span> (belly of two types of tuna) in the world. A common summertime sight is fresh sardines grilling in the open air in the fishing villages or on the beach.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p44">In both Asturias and Cantabria, <span class="italic">salmón</span> (salmon) and <span class="italic">lubina</span> (bass, also known as <span class="italic">perca</span>) are often poached or baked with <span class="italic">sidra</span> (cider). Monkfish, which Asturians call <span class="italic">pixín</span>, is cooked in sauces or rubbed with <span class="italic">pimentón</span>—the flavorful smoked Spanish paprika—and steamed, giving it the appearance of lobster tails. <span class="italic">Rodaballo</span> (turbot) is grilled to enhance its natural taste, and tuna is prepared in many different ways. <span class="italic">Atún en rollito</span> (or <span class="italic">en rollo</span>), a dish unique to Asturias, features rolls of shredded tuna mixed with dry-cured ham and cooked in an onion and carrot sauce.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p45">Of course, the specialties of the area extend far beyond <a id="page12"/>seafood. Further inland, legumes of the best quality are grown, most notably <span class="italic">fabes asturianes,</span> the Asturian white beans of remarkable tenderness and size. The signature dish of Asturias is <span class="italic">fabada asturiana</span>, a stew of these beans with smoked chorizo and <span class="italic">morcilla</span> (blood sausage). In another dish unique to the area, <span class="italic">fabes con almejas</span>, the beans are combined with clams. The chickpeas grown in Liébana, at the skirt of the majestic Picos de Europa, are of extraordinary quality and are acclaimed across the country. Cantabrians combine these small local legumes with cabbage, meats, and sausages for their famed <span class="italic">cocido lebaniego</span>, while they use white beans for their similar <span class="italic">cocido montañes</span>, which marries them with pork ribs, sausages, cabbage, turnips, and potatoes.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p46">The region’s temperate maritime climate and regular and abundant rainfall creates verdant pastureland ideal for raising cattle. Both Cantabria and Asturias are known for their excellent meat and dairy products. Sirloin or filet mignon with Cabrales, the area’s celebrated blue-veined cheese, or with another local cheese is a common dinner-plate pairing.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p47">Asturias is one of Spain’s principal cheese-producing regions, turning out more than twenty-five types. The most famous are Cabrales and Afuega’l Pitu, to which <span class="italic">pimentón</span> is sometimes added. Because most of the cheeses are crafted by small family operations, Cantabrians produce fewer, though no less excellent, varieties than their Asturian neighbors. Exceptional cheeses of the area include two made from cow’s milk, the blue Picos de Europa and the creamy Queso de Cantabria, and two mixed-milk cheeses, the blue Picón and the delightful smoked Ahumado de Aliva.</p>

<p class="indent" id="p50"><a id="page13"/>Cantabria is also known for its <span class="italic">sobaos</span> (sponge cakes) and <span class="italic">quesadas</span> (cheese cake), which are commercially produced and sold across Spain. The “official” Asturian dessert is <span class="italic">arroz con leche</span>, a luscious creamy rice pudding, often with a crisp caramelized sugar topping. Rice is not commonly used in the region except for this dessert and sometimes when cooked with clams in Cantabria.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p51">The local climate is not ideal for wine making, but it is perfectly suited for apple orchards, so the area makes up for any lack of noteworthy wines with its excellent <a class="hlink" href="Barr_9781607746157_epub_c09_r1.htm#box6">cider production</a>. <span class="italic">Sidra natural</span>, or “natural cider,” made without the addition of carbonic bubbles, is drunk by nearly everyone, and there are many <span class="italic">chigres</span>, or “cider bars,” which serve this drink almost exclusively. It is also used in cooking, adding a special regional flavor to many of the area’s dishes. The few grapes grown here are used to produce Orujo, a spirit made from pomace. The best comes from Potes in Cantabria.</p>
<h2 class="headerA" id="c01-sect4"><span class="red"><a class="hlink" id="ind125a"/>Balearic Islands</span></h2>
<p class="nonindent" id="p52">The Balearic archipelago, which lies off the eastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula in the Mediterranean Sea, is composed of two eastern main islands, Majorca and Minorca, and the smaller Cabrera, and two smaller western islands, Ibiza and Formentera, together known as the Pitiusas. The presence of <span class="italic">talayots</span>, stone structures that date to the third millennium BC, are evidence that this wildly beautiful archipelago has been inhabited since ancient times.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p53">The islands’ strategic location attracted conquerors throughout the centuries, from the Carthaginians, Romans, and Vandals to the Byzantines and Moors. In the thirteenth century, the crown of Aragón took control of the archipelago. Catalonia, part of the kingdom at that time, exercised considerable influence over the Balearics, and even today a dialect of Catalan is still spoken on the islands.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p54">Driving out of Palma, Majorca’s capital, you will enter a landscape cluttered with windmills. Water is scarce, but olive trees are abundant and some are believed to be more than a thousand years old. The Tramuntana mountain range, which runs from the northeast toward the southwest of the island, stops the mostly northern winds of the same name. It is not a compact, massive range but one broken by gorges and valleys, creating a shape similar to that of three rolling waves. North of the mountains, the villages are quieter than those in the south, and the coast is lined with rugged cliffs. Deía, a beautiful village on the north shore, is home to many writers and artists. Southern Majorca, less mountainous and with a more temperate climate, has become a major tourist destination.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p55">Smaller and flatter than Majorca, Minorca also has two principal sides: The north is darker, with ground rich in slate and a turbulent sea. The south is mellow, green, and luscious, with lonely, sandy beaches. Cows graze on meadows, and the dairy industry is sizable. Mahón, the capital, a natural port, was important to the British Navy during the eighteenth century. Britain occupied Minorca in 1708, and the Peace of Utrecht legitimized their presence in 1713. With the exception of a short period of French domination, Minorca was essentially under British control until 1782, although the Spanish did not regain full control until 1802. The other islands have remained under Spanish rule since the expulsion of the Moors.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p56">Third in size, Ibiza is closest to the mainland, just a short ride away by ferry. One of Spain’s fashionable vacation resorts, it is the gathering place of le beau monde and has an intense nightlife. Formentera—the jewel of the Balearic crown in my opinion—is just a stone’s throw away. About three miles long and lined with sandy beaches, it is small and flat and, thanks to strict zoning laws, remains in a glorious state of natural beauty and tranquility.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p57">It would be hard to find a better example of a Mediterranean diet than the cooking from the Balearics. Already during the first century AD, Roman historiographer Pliny praised the excellence of Majorcan olive oil and wines. During the sixteenth century, olive oil production became one of the main income sources for the island, surpassed only by wheat and oats, and most of the farms had their own <span class="italic">almazaras</span>, or olive oil mills. The main varieties grown today are Empeltre, Arbequina, and Picual, and the oil is protected by the Denominación de Origen Aceite de Mallorca.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p58"><a id="page14"/>Although olive oil is used for most cooking on Majorca, <span class="italic">manteca</span> (lard), or <span class="italic">saim</span> in the local dialect, is used to make bread pies, pastries, and especially <span class="italic">ensaimadas</span>, the famous pastry coils of the Balearics. It is typical to see visitors in the Palma airport carrying the telltale cardboard boxes that conceal these iconic pastries. <span class="italic">Cocas</span>, or crusty bread pies topped with various ingredients, are also common. Catalan cooks make similar pies, but they are usually square or rectangular in the Balearics and oval in Catalonia. <span class="italic">Cocarrois</span> and empanadas are savory turnovers filled with vegetables or meats, while <span class="italic">robiols</span> and <span class="italic">crespels</span> are sweet. One bread preparation that does feature the celebrated local olive oil is <span class="italic">pa amb oli</span> (similar to the Catalan <span class="italic">pa amb tomàquet</span>), which appears on every dinner table. Toasted bread is rubbed with tomato, usually <span class="italic">tomàquets de ramellet</span> (small, highly aromatic tomatoes), and sprinkled with olive oil—or the reverse, tomatoes are sprinkled with olive oil and rubbed with bread. The experts still don’t agree!</p>
<p class="indent" id="p59">Not surprisingly, fish and shellfish are frequent menu items. <span class="italic">Mero</span> (grouper) cooked <span class="italic">a la mallorquina</span> (covered with many chopped vegetables and baked), is popular, as are <span class="italic">calamares</span> (squid) and <span class="italic">raya</span> (skate). Visitors to Minorca should not miss the chance to try the local spiny lobster, which has a distinctive bluish cast and is usually served in the tomatoey stew known as <span class="italic">caldereta de langosta</span>. The use of fennel, otherwise rare in the rest of Spain, is typical in these dishes.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p60">The <span class="italic">porc negre</span>, or “black pig” (not to be confused with the <span class="italic">pata negra</span> of <span class="italic">jamón ibérico</span> fame), has lived on the islands for almost seven thousand years. It plays an important role in the life of the locals, many of whom consider it inconceivable to let a day pass without eating <span class="italic">sobrasada</span>, the islands’ signature sausage made from this tasty pork. The humid sea air that makes curing hams in the manner of the mainland impossible helps create the soft texture that distinguishes this intense, semicured, spreadable sausage. It appears in countless ways in everyday cooking, including as a topping for bread and <span class="italic">cocas</span>, in sauces, and in fillings.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p61">Desserts on the islands rely mainly on almonds. Among them are <span class="italic">gató d’ametlla</span>, a rich cake made primarily with almonds, sugar, and eggs, and almond ice cream. Ibiza has a delightful dessert called <span class="italic">flaó</span>, a blend of aniseed, mint, and fresh cheese, and the local apricots, pomegranates, and figs are superb.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p62">The British can be credited with initiating two of Minorca’s best-known products, the magnificent Queso de Mahón and the highly praised Xoriguer gin. They encouraged the Minorcans to raise cows and make cheese, and Queso de Mahón, a pure cow’s milk cheese available both semicured and cured, is the delicious result. The British established the first gin distillery in Mahón, and today the spirit continues to be made in the traditional fashion, in copper stills (introduced by the Moors) heated by wood fires. The British also figure in the story of mayonnaise, known as <span class="italic">salsa mahonesa</span>, after the island’s capital. The Minorcans insist that is was created by one of their own and sent off to Paris by the French when they took Minorca from the British in the 1750s.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p63">Wines are produced on Majorca and regulated by the Binissalem and Plà i Llevant DOs. The allowed grapes are the native Manto Negro and Callet for red wines and Moll for whites. In both DOs, the use of the native Manto Negro, a large, dark grape that yields a big, bold wine, results in wines ideal for maturing in oak. The local white wines are less distinguished and represent only a small part of overall production. Majorcans also manufacture, in limited amounts, Palo de Mallorca, a celebrated digestive made from cinchona bark, brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg.</p>
<h2 class="headerA" id="c01-sect5"><span class="red"><a class="hlink" id="ind149a"/>Basque Country</span></h2>
<p class="nonindent" id="p64">Basque Country, called Euskadi in the Basque language, is the easternmost region of Green Spain. Bordering France in the foothills of the western Pyrenees, it runs westward along the Bay of Biscay, with Cantabria to the west and Navarra and La Rioja to the south.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p65">When the Romans arrived, they found people—probably descendants of tribes of the Cro-Magnon era and promptly named the Vascones by the invaders—inhabiting the broad stretch between the western Pyrenees, the Cantabrian Mountains, and the Ebro River. The northern <a id="page15"/>limit, the Bay of Biscay, proved to be more of an opportunity than a limitation, serving as a gateway to the world. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the mostly nomadic Vascones probably united to fight the incursions of Visigoths. Toward the beginning of the seventh century, they were considered a political unit, the duchy of the Vascones, under Frankish suzerainty. In 778, they defeated Charlemagne at Roncesvalles, inspiring the epic <span class="italic">Chanson de Roland</span> and creating the kingdom of Pamplona, later called Navarre. Portions of that land were subsequently annexed to the Castilian crown, and different kingdoms, battles, and alliances shaped what is now known as the Basque Country.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p66">In this context, it is necessary to clarify two terms. Euskadi, or Basque Country, refers to today’s political unit, or the autonomous community within Spain that includes the three provinces of Álava, Guipúzcoa, and Vizcaya. Euskal Herria, also translated as Basque Country, refers to the broader, historical territory, predating the creation of the ancient kingdom of Navarre, which includes today’s Euskadi, some areas from the autonomous community of Navarra, and the French Basque provinces on the other side of the Pyrenees.</p>

<p class="caption" id="p67"><span class="italic">Frank Gehry’s Guggenheim Museum, a building that revitalized Bilbao and is now its symbol</span></p>
<p class="indent" id="p68">I come from the Basque Country. When I cross the pass of Orduña in the Cantabrians to descend to my hometown, Bilbao, my heart starts to beat faster. I get carried away by the sight of the green mountains and valleys and the <span class="italic">caseríos</span> (farmhouses), and by the thought of once again being home with my family and friends. My heart fills with happiness when I anticipate the culinary wonders that my mother, Marichu, will have ready for me.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p69">We Basques live for cooking and eating. I am biased, I know, but I have not found a similar level of passion anywhere I have traveled. I am often asked to describe Basque cuisine, and my standard answer is that it is <a id="page16"/>deeply felt, honors tradition, and respects the natural flavors of the ingredients. These qualities are on display in the significant number of dishes that are distinctively Basque. The international acclaim achieved by the new Basque cuisine movement led by Juan Mari Arzak is only the most recent example of how Basque cookery has influenced the tables of the rest of Spain and beyond.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p70">Basque fishermen have been sailing the northern Atlantic since the eleventh century. While following the whale, which at that time was the most treasured catch, they encountered banks of cod off the coasts of Terranova (Newfoundland) in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. On nearby islands, some settlements still carry Basque names, and salt cod, or <span class="italic">bacalao</span>, is a hallmark of Basque cuisine. Some historians believe that Basques landed in America before the arrival of Columbus, but while explorers and discoverers proudly proclaim their findings, fishermen never disclose the source of their catch.</p>
<div class="fullpageimage_flow" id="fig32"><img alt="" src="images/Barr_9781607746157_epub_020_r1.jpg"/></div>
<p class="caption" id="p71"><span class="italic">Turbot on an outdoor grill in Getaria, Basque Country</span></p>
<p class="indent" id="p72">The sea has always provided nourishment for the Basques. Squid, preferably the small ones called <span class="italic">txipirones</span>, are cooked in an onion sauce with their ink, to produce <span class="italic">txipirones en su tinta</span>. The deep black of the sauce initially evokes curiosity and sometimes aversion in the uninitiated, but after the first bite, reservations dissolve in the velvety texture of the squid and sublime taste of the sauce. Though more and more scarce, <span class="italic">merluza</span> (hake), or <span class="italic">lebatza</span> in Basque, from the Bay of Biscay knows no paragon (with all due respect to its austral relative from the southern seas). The darker-skinned Basque hake has firm, delicious flesh. Cooks typically panfry the medallions from the upper body and either roast the tail in one piece or cut it crosswise into “steaks” for <span class="italic">merluza en salsa verde</span>, the classic green sauce preparation.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p73"><span class="italic">Marmitako</span>, the potato and tuna stew originally prepared by fishermen on their boats, has become a standard offering in many restaurants. The tuna belly, called <span class="italic">ventresca</span> (or <span class="italic">ijada</span> in Basque), is extremely juicy, flakes beautifully, and is <a id="page17"/>the best tuna for salads. It is usually roasted in the oven with just a little garlic and a splash of olive oil. At my family’s summerhouse in Mundaka, we preserved the extra tuna in olive oil, and we were always happy during the winter to have done so. The gooseneck barnacles my brothers risked their skins to catch on the nearby rocky shore; baby eels from Aguinaga in neighboring Guipúzcoa Province; the turbot from Getaria; <span class="italic">mojojones</span> (the Basque name for mussels, as opposed to <span class="italic">mejillones</span>, as they are known in the rest of the country); and anchovies—all of these and many more bring fond memories of my first tastes as a child of the culinary traditions of my country.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p74"><span class="italic">Bacalao</span>, or salt cod, is a staple of the Basque kitchen. Basques are masters of the art of turning a stale and salty fish into something sumptuous, especially when prepared <span class="italic">pil-pil</span> style, in an emulsion of the cod’s gelatin and olive oil. Other cod preparations, such as <span class="italic">a la vizcaína</span>, <span class="italic">Club Ranero</span>, and <span class="italic">ajoarriero</span>, the latter a loan from neighboring Navarra, are also popular.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p75"><span class="italic">A la vizcaína</span>, or Biscayne style, describes a dish cooked in <span class="italic">salsa vizcaína</span>, a dried-pepper sauce. The dried peppers, called <span class="italic">choriceros</span> because of their importance in the production of chorizo sausages, are harvested at the end of the summer when ripe and hung from the facades of farmhouses to dry. The area surrounding Gernika is famous for these sweet and delicate peppers. Those not destined for drying are harvested while still green, fried with olive oil, and served as an accompaniment to meats and fish, and sometimes alone as a first course. Delicious red beans also come from Gernika, although those from Tolosa are better known. Both are equally tender and buttery and usually cooked with sausages in a stew, supplanting the chickpea stews so popular in other areas of Spain.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p76">All of these dishes are staples of <span class="italic">txokos</span>, the gastronomic societies of Basque Country. These culinary havens are the dominion of men, as their rules restrict women from joining, though some societies make exceptions and allow us in once a month or sometimes once a year. Their purpose is to give members a place to show off their culinary techniques and creations and to have a good time cooking, eating, and drinking. These traditional societies have made significant contributions to the annals of Basque cooking, and some dishes that originated in <span class="italic">txokos</span>, such as <span class="italic">marmitako</span> made with salmon instead of tuna or various foie gras and duck breast dishes, have become classics.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p77">Equally traditional is barhopping before lunch or dinner, which is essentially a regional sport. Bar counters display numerous <span class="italic">pintxos</span>, the equivalent to tapas in other areas of the country. Making the rounds consists of popping in and out of several bars, usually the same ones every day, grabbing a <span class="italic">pintxo</span> and drinking a <span class="italic">txikito</span> (a small glass of wine) in each one. It is a way to meet friends and acquaintances without arranging a specific date, before heading home for a proper meal.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p78">Cheeses are among the typical <span class="italic">pintxos</span> found in the region’s many bars, with Idiazábal, produced in Navarra as well, the most highly regarded. The sheep’s milk cheese holds such importance for the Basques that a contest to judge the best artisanal Idiazábal cheeses is held every September in the town of Ordizia, in Guipúzcoa Province. In September 1999, I was one of twenty jurors at the annual contest. We tried more than seventy different cheeses, and a portion of the winner was auctioned that day for five thousand dollars. I was in heaven trying all of those buttery-textured, strong-flavored, nutty-tasting cheeses.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p79">Rioja Alavesa, one of the three subregions of the <a class="hlink" href="Barr_9781607746157_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-sect2">La Rioja wine-producing area</a>, is in the Basque province of Álava, and the wines from there are much lighter and fruitier than the wines from the other two sectors. Txakolí is a distinct wine made from grapes—Ondarribi Beltza for the reds, Ondarribi Zuri for the whites—cultivated in the provinces of Vizcaya and Guipúzcoa (Bizkaiko Txakolina and Getariako Txakolina DOs). Generally young, light, and fresh tasting, it is available everywhere in Basque Country, but especially in coastal areas, where it is a perfect match for seafood. Its effervescence makes it comparable to young whites from Penedès and Rías Baixas. Cider has long been drunk in Basque Country as well, but the wine drinking, perhaps because of the proximity to the Rioja region, is of greater cultural importance.</p>

<h2 class="headerA" id="c01-sect6"><a id="page18"/><span class="red">The <a class="hlink" id="ind265a"/>Canary Islands</span></h2>
<p class="nonindent" id="p81">Situated in the Atlantic Ocean seventy miles from the Saharan shore and more than six hundred miles south of continental Spain, the Canaries are a group of islets and seven main islands: Lanzarote, Fuerteventura, Grand Canary, Tenerife, Gomera, La Palma, and Hierro. Much like the islands of Hawaii, the Canaries were formed by volcanic eruptions from the seabed. The highest volcano, at about twelve thousand feet, is Pico de Teide, Spain’s tallest peak. Among the islands’ main attractions are their many spectacular views: the endless sandy beaches of Fuerteventura; the lunarlike landscapes carved by riverbeds of lava rock on Lanzarote; the lush <span class="italic">barrancos</span> (deep canyons) on La Palma, Tenerife, and Gomera; and the immense <span class="italic">calderas</span> (craters) of Las Cañadas on Tenerife.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p82">The climate on the islands is benign, with ever-present trade winds, mild temperatures year-round, and plenty of sunshine. Each island has become a tourist destination for northern Europeans seeking an escape from hard winters to the land of eternal springtime.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p83">The Canary Islands drew transients in the past as well, playing an important role in the Age of Exploration. Christopher Columbus landed in Las Palmas in 1492, on the first leg of the trip that would lead him to the New World, and subsequent expeditions stopped on the islands to replenish supplies. On return trips to Spain, the ships stopped here, and so the islanders were the first to receive and admire the findings from the New World. This explains why many culinary traditions common in the Canaries echo those in the Caribbean and other places in the Americas, such as dishes prepared with bananas, much as they are in Cuba; <span class="italic">sancocho</span>, a salted fish and potato dish also popular in Puerto Rico; and the use of cilantro, which is rare in the rest of Spain.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p84"><span class="italic">Gofio</span>, an ancient food rich in calories and fiber, has long been an important source of nourishment for rural residents of the islands. Sandy-colored toasted flour—<a id="page19"/>originally made from roasted wheat but now more often from roasted corn, barley, chickpeas, or various roots—is mixed with liquid and added to soups or stews as a thickener at the end of cooking, or it is mixed with water, hand pressed into small balls, and served as a starch accompaniment to main courses. Today, with the abundance of alternative sources of starch, <span class="italic">gofio</span> is not as widely eaten as in the past.</p>
<div class="fullpageimage_flow" id="div12"><img alt="" src="images/Barr_9781607746157_epub_022_r1.jpg"/></div>
<p class="caption" id="p85"><span class="italic">The small fishing bay of San Ginés in Arrecife, Lanzarote</span></p>
<p class="indent" id="p86">The islanders are also famous for their <span class="italic">mojos</span> (sauces or dips), which come in many variations, and while they bear the same name, they are completely different from the <span class="italic">mojos</span> of Latin America. Canarian <span class="italic">mojos</span> are made with olive oil, vinegar, garlic, red (dried and crushed) or green peppers, parsley, cilantro, and other ingredients, depending on the dish they are to accompany. They are ubiquitous side dishes for dipping <span class="italic">papas arrugadas</span> (wrinkled potatoes), fish, or meats, with red <span class="italic">mojos</span> usually paired with meats and potatoes and green ones with fish.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p87">The potatoes that we consume today in Europe and in the United States bear little resemblance to those originally carried from South America to the Canaries by the conquistadors. Several of the latter varieties are still grown here today, including the <span class="italic">papa negra</span>, or “black potato,” which is not found elsewhere in Europe. It has almost-black skin and yellow flesh with an intense and delicious flavor. The other crops of the islands are rich in variety but small in production, with the exception of tomatoes and bananas. The plum-shaped Canary tomato, once a vital part of the economy, is still valued for its flavor and aroma. Lettuce, cucumbers, beans, peas, Swiss chard, leeks, spinach, chayote, and many more vegetables are available almost year-round, and <span class="italic">berros</span> (watercress) is especially popular on the islands, unlike in continental Spain. The small Canary banana, <span class="italic">plátano canario</span>, is prized for its soft texture and sweet flavor. Bananas were first planted on the islands by the Portuguese, who brought <a id="page20"/>them from Guinea, and from here they were introduced to the Americas. Many other fruits—oranges, figs, avocados, mangoes, papayas, pineapples, and dates—flourish in the subtropical climate as well.</p>

<p class="indent" id="p89">Surrounded by the relatively cool eastern Atlantic, the coral-free and mostly rocky and sandy fishing grounds offer numerous types of fish, which the islanders cook in just as many ways. <span class="italic">Vieja</span>, a type of parrot fish, is delicious baked or boiled. <span class="italic">Pargo</span> and <span class="italic">besugo</span>, similar to bream and snapper, are grilled and served with <span class="italic">mojos</span> and <span class="italic">papas arrugadas</span>. <span class="italic">Cherne</span> (grouper), which is often salted and used in <span class="italic">sancocho</span>, is probably the most celebrated fish, although it is quite expensive. More ordinary catch are made into everyday dishes, such as <span class="italic">sardinas en escabeche</span> (marinated sardines), <span class="italic">caballa con mojo</span> (mackerel with red <span class="italic">mojo</span>), and <span class="italic">atún escabechado</span> (marinated tuna).</p>
<p class="indent" id="p90">The same geography that has made fish a central element of the local table has also defined cheese production. Because there is neither room for large cattle herds nor conditions for their grazing, small farmers have plenty of goats and sheep, which require less maintenance and can more easily scale the steep slopes of the green valleys. The result is a healthy production of goat’s and sheep’s milk cheeses, the most acclaimed of which are the fresh, aged, or smoked goat cheeses of La Palma, such as Queso Palmero. For the same reasons, local meats consist mainly of <span class="italic">cabrito</span> (baby goat), <span class="italic">cordero</span> (lamb), and <span class="italic">conejo</span> (rabbit). The kids and lambs are milk-fed and then slaughtered when they are less than three weeks old.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p91">In the early days, the distinctive terrain of the islands also supported the cultivation of sugarcane, a crop that was taken from the Canaries to the New World near the <a id="page22"/>beginning of colonization. The Spanish authorities soon realized that sugarcane, and hence rum, production overseas was more cost effective, so they didn’t promote the industry in the islands. On Grand Canary and La Palma, sugarcane is still grown and harvested as it has been for centuries, though its production is small. Canarians also produce a local rum, Ron Arehucas, that is delicious, albeit little known outside the islands.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p92">Grapes have fared much better than sugarcane. They were planted on the islands by the Spaniards before the discovery of the Americas. The environment was not perfect, and some adaptation was necessary to marry the vines to the local climate and soil. But the islanders were intent on making viticulture work, so they would able to export wine to the Americas later. For example, Lanzarote, the most volcanic of the islands, has little rain and constant temperatures. To grow vines in these conditions, a special process is required: each vine is nestled in a hole in the lava ash and protected by a semicircular stone wall that shields it from wind erosion. Against all odds, the wines obtained are excellent. The landscape is breathtaking: the black of the lava ash, the reds and browns of the minerals, and the intense green of the vine leaves create a picture of incredible beauty.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p93">Lanzarote is one of eleven DOs in the islands, with Tenerife boasting five of them, and only Fuerteventura without a single one. Although production is small and the wines are mostly consumed locally, the constantly improved quality of some of them has attracted outside attention, primarily from the many visitors who come seeking the sun. The predominant grapes include Güal, Listán Blanco, Malvasía, Marmajuelo, Moscatel, and imported Pedro Ximénez for white wines, and Listán Negro, Tintilla, Negramoll, and Moscatel Negro for reds, as well as an increasing number of such imported grapes as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah, and Tempranillo. The wines made from local grapes are typically fruity, spicy, and mellow in the case of the whites, and intensely colored, fruity, low in tannins, and with light balsamic accents in the case of the reds. The reds, because of low acidity and lack of tannins, are best consumed while they are still young. Some excellent muscatel dessert wines are also bottled on the islands.</p>

<h2 class="headerA" id="c01-sect7"><span class="red">The Castiles and Madrid</span></h2>
<p class="nonindent" id="p95">Castile, or “land of castles,” is the largest natural region on Spain’s wide central plateau, known as la Meseta Castellana. The plateau nearly coincides with the autonomous communities of Castilla–La Mancha, Castilla y León, and Madrid, making up the country’s largest geographic region. Although the Castiles are split administratively, they form a cultural unity, with Madrid at the center.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p96">Old Castile, the area north of Madrid known today as Castilla y León, was the first territory recovered from the Moors during the Middle Ages; more than ten thousand castles and fortresses testify to the long military campaigns that successfully pushed them to the south. The area south of Madrid, today’s Castilla–La Mancha, was recovered from the Moors in the mid-thirteenth century; hence, its designation as New Castile. The two Castiles were united soon after, and with the kingdom’s power situated here, the area developed into the geographic and political heart of Spain. Until recently, Castilian was designated the country’s only official language.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p97">Except for the western border with Portugal, mountain ranges frame the plateau on all sides. To access northern, eastern, or southern Spain, you must first cross mountain passes and only then descend to the coast. The plateau, frequently bleak and arid, has an average altitude of about twenty-five hundred feet and experiences temperatures ranging from bitterly cold in the winter to fiercely hot in the summer. Rain is scarce, and snow is common in the winter only on the mountain peaks where precipitation is higher.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p98">The city of Madrid lies at the very center of Spain. Traditionally, it has been the melting pot for immigrants from other parts of the country (and increasingly from other parts of the world). Originally home to farmers and cattle herders, it remained a sleepy enclave until the mid-sixteenth century, when Philip II designated it the capital of the Habsburg empire. This late recognition explains why ancient buildings and monuments so common elsewhere in the country are absent in the capital. The king could have chosen another city with a richer history and greater wealth, but he saw Madrid’s central location as a fitting symbol of a young, unified Spain.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p99"><a id="page23"/>The new capital quickly prospered, attracting everyone who wanted to be close to power. The arts flourished, and so did gastronomy. The impetus given to Madrid by the Habsburgs continued under the Bourbons two centuries later. In the mid-eighteenth century, Charles III, a great promoter of the city, initiated a period of major monumental architecture. Now, after almost five hundred years, Madrid remains the political and cultural core of the country.</p>
<div class="fullpageimage_flow" id="div15"><img alt="" src="images/Barr_9781607746157_epub_025_r1.jpg"/></div>
<p class="caption" id="p100"><span class="italic">Gran Cafe Zaragoza</span></p>
<p class="indent" id="p101">Because of its role as both capital and melting pot, Madrid has had many influences shaping its cuisine, making it difficult to define a true Madrilenian dish. But if Madrid has a culinary hallmark, it is undoubtedly <span class="italic">cocido madrileño</span>, a hearty chickpea stew laced with meats and sausages. Every region has its own version of this dish, but the one from Madrid, in my opinion, is the best. Another distinctive local dish is <span class="italic">callos a la madrileña</span>, tripe in a delicious lightly spiced sauce. Dishes with <span class="italic">riñones</span> (kidneys), <span class="italic">sesos</span> (brains), and <span class="italic">mollejas</span> (sweetbreads) have always been highly valued not only here but across the country. Even though Madrid is landlocked, and as far from the coasts as one can get in Spain, it is said to have some of the best seafood in the country, with fish arriving daily from every stretch of the Spanish coastline. The magnificent asparagus and strawberries from the nearby vegetable gardens of Aranjuez are also fixtures on the capital’s tables. And as in many other parts of Spain, the locals love to eat churros for breakfast.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p102">The traditional cuisine of the Castiles is equally varied, although in the south, where resources are more limited, cooking tends to be more rustic. Roasts of lamb, suckling pig, and baby goat are excellent and common in every corner of the region. In southern Castile, the <span class="italic">galianos</span> or <span class="italic">gazpachos manchegos</span>, hearty stews combining bread and fowl, are highly acclaimed, as is <span class="italic">morteruelo</span> from Cuenca, a pâtélike preparation of hare or rabbit and pork. Partridge and trout are also popular, either cooked or pickled, and each province has a version of <span class="italic">cocido</span>, the meal-in-a-pot stew. The vegetable stew called <span class="italic">pisto</span>, which originally consisted of only peppers and tomatoes, has its <a id="page24"/>roots in La Mancha, though it is now cooked all over Spain. The delightful garlic and bread soup, <span class="italic">sopa castellana</span>, or <span class="italic">sopa de ajo</span>, is common throughout the Castiles and beyond, and is made with a number of variations, such as the addition of poached eggs or cured ham. In the northwestern province of León, bordering Galicia, empanadas are everyday home-cooked dishes. <span class="italic">Azafrán</span> (saffron) from La Mancha, <span class="italic">miel</span> (honey) from La Alcarria, in Guadalajara Province, and <span class="italic">mazapán</span> (marzipan) from Toledo are reminders of past times when Jewish, Muslim, and Christian cooking and cultures blended, creating the foundation of Spain’s culinary repertory.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p103">Specialty foods of the Castiles are appreciated throughout the country. The best <span class="italic">jamónes ibéricos</span> of Spain are produced in Salamanca, a province northwest of Madrid. Magnificent sausages, or <span class="italic">embutidos</span>, including blood sausage from Burgos and chorizo from León, Salamanca, and Zamora, are also much admired. Locally grown legumes, such as <span class="italic">alubias blancas</span> (white beans) from Segovia and lentils from Zamora, end up in pantries all over the country, and the cheeses made on the plains are magnificent. The sheep’s milk cheese Manchego, the best known of them all, was, as its name indicates, originally from La Mancha. (Known to the Moors as al-Manshah, or “dry land,” this region was later home to the adventures and misadventures of Cervantes’s Don Quixote, and the windmills that punctuate its landscape are reminders of the knight errant.) Other cheeses produced in Castile include the tasty Zamorano from Zamora, north of Madrid; Burgos, a mild and soft cheese that blends sheep’s and cow’s milk; and the intense blue Valdeón from León, made on the opposite side of the Picos de Europa from where the famed and quite similar Asturian Cabrales is produced.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p104">North of Madrid in Old Castile, magnificent wines are fashioned in Rueda, Ribera del Duero, Toro, Cigales, and Bierzo. In southern Castile, the main wine-growing areas include Valdepeñas, Almansa, La Mancha, Mentrida, and Madrid. Both regions share dryer climate conditions and higher average altitudes than Rioja, for example, which translates into hotter days and colder nights. These extreme variations in temperature result in hearty, full-bodied wines, with Ribera del Duero, Toro, and Cigales producing some of Spain’s most acclaimed bottles. Dishes such as suckling pig and lamb go particularly well with these big wines.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p105">Like the winemakers, the residents of the convents and monasteries in the Castiles have played important roles in preserving the country’s gastronomic traditions, primarily its confectionary recipes. Saint Teresa of Ávila, in her role as mother superior of her convent, famously reminded the nuns who wanted to skip working in the kitchen in favor of going to the chapel for oration that God also wandered among the pots and pans. In her honor, the Spanish Academy of Gastronomy awards a series of national prizes every year on her saint’s day (and mine), October 15. Her legendary sweets, <span class="italic">yemas de Santa Teresa</span>, are made today the same way as they were centuries ago.</p>

<h2 class="headerA" id="c01-sect8"><a id="page25"/><span class="red"><a class="hlink" id="ind315a"/>Catalonia</span></h2>
<p class="nonindent" id="p108">Catalonia is a region of contrasts in both its geography and its culinary traditions. Occupying a triangular area in the northeastern part of the peninsula, it is separated from France by the Pyrenees in the north, and bordered by Aragón in the west, Levante in the south, and the Mediterranean in the east. This autonomous community is composed of four provinces: Barcelona, Gerona, and Tarragona bordering the Mediterranean, and Lérida in the interior.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p109">The Costa Brava, the rocky shoreline of Gerona, the northernmost province, gives way to the sandy beaches of the Costa Dorada, which stretches south to Tarragona. In the south, around the Ebro delta where Catalonia borders Castellón, the northern province of the Levante region, rice plantations dominate the landscape. Olive groves and vineyards are also abundant in the flatlands south of Barcelona, contrasting sharply with the harsh mountainous area in the Pyrenees to the north. Lérida, with Aragón to its west and its three partner provinces to its east, is predominantly agricultural. Unlike other areas of Spain, where large estates are typical, most of this cultivated land is leased or owned by small farmers.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p110">Catalonia was one of the first possessions of the Romans in Spain. Salt Mountain, near the medieval town of Cardona, was used by the Romans as a source of salt for preserving fish, among other foods. An extraordinary geological curiosity, the five-hundred-foot hill of almost pure salt is still mined today. Some of this salt is used in L’Escala, a fishing village in Gerona, to preserve the wonderful local anchovies, which are usually slightly larger than those found in the Basque Country or Cantabria. The preservation includes a pinch of black pepper between the salt layers, giving the fish a characteristic taste.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p111">Catalonia’s proximity and longtime links to Italy and France are reflected today in the importance of such dishes as bouillabaisse and <span class="italic">canelones</span> (cannelloni). In the twelfth century, the high valley in the Pyrenees known in Spain as Cerdaña and in France as Cerdagne was part of Rosellón (Roussillon in France) and belonged to the Aragónese crown. Later it was under the rule of the Majorcan monarchy. In the mid-seventeenth century, Spain ceded most of the area to France, where today <a id="page26"/>Roussillonaise, a Catalan dialect, is still spoken. (Similarly, another Catalan dialect can still be heard in the Sardinian town of Alghero, where Catalans introduced their language in the fourteenth century.) This web of language and culture has resulted in the Catalan <span class="italic">bullabesa</span> (<span class="italic">bullir</span> in Catalan and <span class="italic">bouillir</span> in French both mean “to boil”) and the French bouillabaisse being nearly the same soup, with each a mix of fish and shellfish, parsley, and saffron and served with toasted bread rubbed with garlic.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p112">Foreign culinary traditions became an even greater influence in the late-nineteenth century with the arrival of the industrial revolution in Barcelona. The changing economy attracted business (and other) travelers from abroad, mainly from Italy and France, and prompted a proliferation of hotels and restaurants, all of which hoped to draw the new visitors to their tables. These “fancy” restaurants and hotels, with names like Hotel de Las Cuatro Naciones, Grand Restaurant de France, and Chez Martin, began serving cassoulet and <span class="italic">canelones</span>, and today <span class="italic">canelones</span> are so much a part of the local table that they are traditionally served during the Christmas holiday season.</p>
<div class="fullpageimage_flow" id="div18"><img alt="" src="images/Barr_9781607746157_epub_028_r1.jpg"/></div>
<p class="caption" id="p113"><span class="italic">Almond tree in bloom in front of an ancient church in Canet d’Adri, outside Girona, Catalonia</span></p>
<p class="indent" id="p114">Catalonia is also known for its bounty of raw ingredients. Magnificent olive oil produced in the southern reaches of Tarragona and Lérida, mainly from Arbequina olives, is a staple in Catalan kitchens. The well-known <span class="italic">alioli</span>, which marries olive oil, eggs, and garlic in a creamy sauce, is a logical outgrowth of the abundance of olives. Catalan rice, also from the southern area, is cooked throughout the region in many different ways. Along with Valencia and Calasparra in Murcia, Tarragona is a major rice producer under the Delta del Ebro DO, with Bahía as its main variety. Lérida Province, rich in woodlands that climb to the Pyrenees, supplies the region with a magnificent variety of aromatic mushrooms and truffles. At the large, busy Mercado de la Boqueria, in the heart of Barcelona, you will find all these different foods artfully displayed.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p115">Catalans like to combine fowl with fruits, such as <span class="italic">pato con peras</span> (duck with pears). Their taste for <span class="italic">mar y montaña</span>, or “sea and mountain,” is present in dishes like lobster with <a id="page27"/>chicken or in rice dishes that combine rabbit and seafood, as in the hearty <span class="italic">conejo con sepia</span>. Seafood casseroles like <span class="italic">suquets</span> are common in the coastal areas, while fowl is favored inland. Chickens and capons from the Prat DO are a special breed with tasty and tender meat and relatively little fat. The birds have bluish legs and long breasts, and their somewhat large eggs, with reddish shells, are also sold in markets. Vic, a mountain town in the Pyrenees, is known for its <span class="italic">salchichón</span>, a tasty sausage that resembles French <span class="italic">saucisson</span>. The distinctiveness of <span class="italic">fuet</span>, a much thinner cured sausage, and <span class="italic">longanizas</span> and <span class="italic">butifarras</span>, specialty sausages unique to Catalonia, can make it difficult to reproduce certain Catalan dishes outside the region.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p116">The cheeses of Catalonia, produced mainly in the Pyrenean provinces of Lérida and Gerona, are intriguing as well. Queso de L’Alt Urgell y la Cerdanya is a creamy cow’s milk cheese with a sweet aroma. Near Olot, the buttery, soft, stark white goat’s milk Garrotxa, after a rural district of the same name, is produced. Mató, shaped like an inverted bowl, is a salt-free fresh curd cheese now made from cow’s and goat’s milk, and in the past from goat’s milk. It is popular across Catalonia and is usually served with honey for a simple dessert. Serrat, a sheep’s milk cheese sold both semicured and fully cured, also comes from the Pyrenees.</p>
<div class="fullpageimage_flow" id="div19"><img alt="" src="images/Barr_9781607746157_epub_029_r1.jpg"/></div>
<p class="caption" id="p117"><span class="italic">Barcelona’s Boqueria market</span></p>
<p class="indent" id="p118">Catalonia’s wine landscape is equally diverse. The region’s best-known wine is <span class="italic">cava</span>, one of the world’s premier sparkling wines. Ninety-five percent of the <span class="italic">cavas</span> are produced in Penedès, the area south of Barcelona near the Tarragona border. Their production relies primarily on four grape varieties—Macabeo, Xarel-lo, Parellada, and Subirat—though Chardonnay is also allowed by the regulatory council. In the case of rosé <span class="italic">cavas</span>, only two red grapes are used, Trepat and Pinot Noir.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p119"><a id="page28"/>The main varieties used in Catalan whites are Xarel-lo, Garnacha Blanca, and, in smaller quantities, Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc, and Gewürztraminer. Reds are predominantly pressed from Garnacha Tinta, Merlot, Tempranillo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, and Cariñena, combined in varying proportions. The Priorat DO, a relatively small wine area southwest of Barcelona, produces intense, full-bodied reds that are consistently ranked among the best wines in the world. The area harbors the ideal combination of sun, precipitation, and, most notably, a slate-rich soil that imparts deep mineral notes that make Priorat wines taste unlike any others. The predominant grape varieties are Garnacha Blanca, Macabeo, Pedro Ximénez, and Xenin for whites, and Cariñena and Garnacha Negra, along with strategic support from such imports as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Syrah, for the reds. Though these much-admired wines complement the local table, the low yields and high labor costs involved in producing them make them expensive for everyday dining.</p>
<div class="fullpageimage_flow" id="div20"><img alt="" src="images/Barr_9781607746157_epub_030_r1.jpg"/></div>
<p class="caption" id="p120"><a class="hlink" id="ind522a"/><span class="italic">Grazing in a</span> dehesa <span class="italic">in southern Extremadura</span></p>
<h2 class="headerA" id="c01-sect9"><span class="red">Extremadura</span></h2>
<p class="nonindent" id="p121">Bordered by Portugal in the west, Andalusia in the south, and Castile in the east and north, Extremadura—the cradle of many conquistadors—is a land of extremes. <span class="italic">Dehesas</span>, vast natural prairies that can be blisteringly hot in the summer and bitter cold in the winter, cover most of the area, with the exception of the counties in the north. Stone oaks and <span class="italic">alcornoques</span> (cork oaks) dot the prairies, creating the perfect habitat for cattle and especially for the <span class="italic">pata negra</span>, the famed <span class="italic">ibérico</span> pig. In contrast, the area to the north of the Tagus River is home to fertile valleys with rich pastureland. Freshwater fish and goats and sheep replace pork at the table, and the plentiful wild vegetables—thistles, asparagus, and mushrooms—are cooked with little adornment.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p122">This diverse landscape has, like Spain’s other regions, been inhabited by a series of conquerors, all of whom appreciated the varied topography and the wealth of natural <a id="page29"/>resources. The Romans made this part of Hispania, which they called Lusitania, one of their main colonies, as evidenced by the stunning structures still found in Mérida, the contemporary capital.</p>
<div class="fullpageimage_flow" id="div21"><img alt="" src="images/Barr_9781607746157_epub_031_r1.jpg"/></div>
<p class="caption" id="p123"><span class="italic">Landscape with single oak tree, Extremadura</span></p>
<p class="indent" id="p124">In the years following the collapse of the Roman Empire and throughout the Reconquista, Extremadura remained a dominant region in the country. Then, in the sixteenth century, the region spawned many of Spain’s powerful conquistadors, including Hernán Cortés from Medellín and Francisco Pizarro and Francisco Orellanos from Trujillo. Their exploits abroad introduced not only unprecedented wealth to the kingdom at large and to Extremadura in particular, but also such now common foods as potatoes, corn, and peppers, among others.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p125">Large-scale sheepherding contributed wealth in yet another form to the region, the wool trade. As a result, the status of the herdsmen and their charges was so elevated that rights guaranteeing their free passage on delineated trails, known as Cañadas Reales, were written into Spanish property laws as far back as the thirteenth century. Five of Spain’s nine major herding trails either begin or end in Extremadura. Together they total some forty-two hundred miles in the region, a number that underlines the strong influence the herding culture had and continues to have in the area.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p126">But centuries of herding proved damaging to the area as well. Because herdsmen, through their considerable control over the land, essentially dominated the regional economy, they were a primary reason that farming and manufacturing industries did not develop here as they did in other parts of Spain. As a result, a relative austerity and isolation plagued Extremadura during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p127">The region’s <span class="italic">cocina monacal</span>, or cuisine from the monasteries and convents, remained important through much of this history. In the years after the exploration of the Americas, when few Spaniards were literate, the country’s educated monks specialized in writing, transcribing letters, translating manuscripts, and recording customs—<a id="page30"/>including recipes—of the times. Even today, many monasteries and convents still sell delicious pastries and other sweets to earn money to sustain themselves, and efforts are now under way to revive the favorite dishes of Emperor Charles V, who retired to the monastery at Yuste after ruling much of the Western World for some four decades. In letters to his son Phillip II, he richly describes the delicacies of <span class="italic">la cocina monacal</span>, most notably those made by the monks in the monastery at Guada-lupe. Among them was <span class="italic">técula mécula</span>, which is included in the desserts chapter.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p128">Residents of the local monasteries and convents were also among the earliest Spaniards to cultivate crops from the New World because they often encountered them first. When Columbus returned from the Americas, he visited the Catholic Kings in Guadalupe, bringing them many gifts, including peppers. The monks there planted them, and gradually other monasteries throughout the area began growing and using them as well. The nearby La Vera valley is now renowned for its <span class="italic">pimentón</span>, or Spanish paprika, made from these American natives. The county of La Vera, in the northeastern corner of Cáceres Province in Extremadura, comprises the valleys between the Tietar, Alagón, and Arrago rivers. This area is home to about fifty villages, many of which add “de la Vera” to their name, such as Jarandilla de la Vera. Benign temperatures, many hours of sunlight, and extraordinarily fertile soil make this the perfect place to grow peppers.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p129">The cooking of the region is often as austere as some of the local landscape. Cold gazpachos and <span class="italic">salmorejos</span> are common fare, especially during the hot summer months, and are similar to Andalusian soups. <span class="italic">Ajo blanco</span>, the white almond gazpacho, is prepared the same way as in neighboring Andalusia. Otherwise rarely used in Spain, except for in the kitchens of the Canaries, cilantro is essential to Extremadura’s wonderful Christmas chicken dish, <span class="italic">escabeche de pollo de Navidad</span>. In the north, above the Tagus River, freshwater fish are caught, especially the <span class="italic">tenca</span>, a small fish that is typically deep-fried until crunchy. Frog legs are also highly prized, as is lizard, and baby goat is slowly simmered in stews. South of the Tagus River, in the <span class="italic">dehesas</span>, the meat of choice is pork, above all the famed <span class="italic">jamón ibérico</span>, and lamb, rather than the goat of the north, is cooked in stews.</p>

<p class="caption" id="p130"><span class="italic">The tools of a village butcher</span></p>
<p class="indent" id="p131">Extremadura produces one of the best <span class="italic">ibérico</span> hams in Spain, Dehesa de Extremadura DO. But it also “assists” other DOs in scoring highly, because many pigs are fattened on acorns on the local <span class="italic">dehesas</span> and then taken to other regions for slaughtering and curing. In addition to becoming wonderful air-cured hams and <span class="italic">lomos</span> (loins), the prized pigs provide succulent fresh meat. <span class="italic">Secreto</span>, or “secret,” a special cut from the breast next to the neck, is thinly sliced and simply fried. No seasonings are added, as nothing could improve the taste of the cut; and, indeed, the presence of any other ingredients would <a id="page31"/>awaken the suspicion that the <span class="italic">pata negra</span> may not have been in excellent condition. Suckling pig, called <span class="italic">cochinito</span> or <span class="italic">lechoncillo</span>, is typically cut into small pieces, marinated with garlic, <span class="italic">pimentón</span>, and wine, and then fried in olive oil until crunchy. Though quite simple, these preparations are difficult to duplicate, since the essential ingredient—fresh Extremaduran <span class="italic">pata negra</span>—is hard to find outside the region, even within Spain.</p>

<p class="caption" id="p132">Jamón <span class="italic">factory in Extremadura</span></p>
<p class="indent" id="p133"><span class="italic">Migas</span> (literally “bread crumbs”)—of which I have wonderful memories from my stay years ago on an estate in Valencia de Alcántara, near the Portuguese border—is a humble yet delicious dish of bread, oil, vinegar, and garlic, served originally for breakfast but increasingly for lunch. Some cooks add a shot of anise liqueur halfway through the cooking to cheer up the morning hours. In <span class="italic">migas canas</span>, a milder version, the garlic is removed from the pan before the bread is added, and after the golden crunchy crumbs are fried, they are covered with milk.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p134">Because of the long history and continued importance of sheep farming in the region, the emphasis on sheep’s milk cheeses here will come as no surprise. In terms of quality, cheese production in Extremadura is extraordinary. Two of the finest are Torta del Casar and Queso de la Serena, both made exclusively with raw Merino sheep’s milk and coagulated with wild thistle rennet. Torta del Casar is so creamy that the top rind is usually cut off horizontally, to prevent the interior from flowing out, and the rich, runny cheese is eaten with a spoon. Yet another delicious local cheese, Queso Ibores, is made from raw goat’s milk, and its rind is either rubbed with <span class="italic">pimentón</span>, yielding a reddish orange finish, or olive oil, which turns it a yellow-ocher.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p135">The cherries grown in the valley along the Jerte River in the northern area of Cáceres Province are yet another extraordinary product of Extremadura. Seven varieties are cultivated, and they are shipped—and cherished—across the country. The association of Valle del Jerte and cherries is automatic in the mind of any Spaniard.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p136">Although Extremadura, like much of Spain, has an ancient wine tradition, its contemporary production has <a id="page32"/>been regulated only since 1997, and its following outside the region is limited. The Ribera del Guadiana DO controls and protects wines made in an area that includes most of Badajoz Province and the southern part of Cáceres Province. Newer wines are beginning to be more widely recognized and are now being exported successfully, even if only for their exceptional value. The grapes most often used for whites are Cayetana Blanca, Macabeo, and Pardina, while Tempranillo, Graciano, and Garnacha Tinta and some imported Merlot, Monastrell, and Syrah go into the making of reds.</p>

<h2 class="headerA" id="c01-sect10"><span class="red">Galicia</span></h2>
<p class="nonindent" id="p138">Western Spain points to the New World with its prow. But long before its inhabitants dreamed of a land beyond, the Romans aptly named this area—the westernmost point of continental Europe—Cabo Finisterre, or “the end of the world.” Part of Green Spain, Galicia seems a world away from the dry south. The climate is mild, and rains are copious.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p139">The arabesques, arched arcades, saffron, cinnamon, gazpachos, and deep-frying of southern Spain are practically nonexistent here because the Moors, with the exception of a few brief incursions, never established themselves in the area. Instead, Celtic settlements and Roman bridges characterize the landscape, and empanadas, boiled fresh hams, scallops, and <span class="italic">pimentón</span> the cuisine. More than seven hundred miles long, Galicia’s coastline is rugged, with fjordlike formations of incredible beauty alternating with sandy beaches. The interior is hilly and covered with woodlands, and where it borders the Castilian <span class="italic">meseta</span>, or plains, the terrain is mountainous. More than half of Galicia’s land is forested, while the rest is split between farms and pastures.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p140"><a id="page33"/>Spain’s best shellfish comes from Galicia’s coast. To me, there is simply no better place on earth to eat seafood than La Piedra, the seafood market in Vigo. At its entrance, you can eat <span class="italic">ostras</span> (oysters) sold directly by fisherwomen. The area is cluttered with small bars offering the freshest clams, mussels, langoustines, <span class="italic">centollas</span> (female spider crabs, considered tastier than their male counterparts), and <span class="italic">nécoras</span> (also delectable—and expensive—crabs). Usually steamed, <span class="italic">berberechos</span> (cockles) are a delicious local specialty that Italian markets in North America sometimes mislabel <span class="italic">vongole</span>, though the proper Italian name for this delight is <span class="italic">cuore edule</span>. Rare in other parts of Spain, <span class="italic">vieiras</span> (scallops) are abundant and popular in Galicia. In fact, they are so plentiful here that the scallop shell, the symbol of Saint James, remains an icon of the pilgrimage to the saint’s tomb in Santiago de Compostela in western Galicia. In the past, returning home with a scallop shell from the journey was regarded as proof of having made the arduous trip.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p141">In Galicia, the quality of the seafood is so good that only minimal intervention in the kitchen is required. Steaming and boiling are popular ways to prepare mussels, clams, and the prized gooseneck barnacles. Galician turbot is spectacular, usually oven baked or roasted with a little <span class="italic">pimentón</span>. Fresh sardines are mainly grilled, and the smaller ones, <span class="italic">xoubas</span>, are used for stuffing empanadas. Not limited to the sea, Gallegos also catch <span class="italic">lampreas</span> (lampreys) in limited quantities from the Miño and Ulloa rivers between December and March, and typically cook them in their own blood mixed simply with olive oil, vinegar, white wine, and garlic.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p142"><span class="italic">Pulpo</span> (octopus), another specialty of the area, is usually boiled, cut into small pieces, and served <span class="italic">a la gallega</span>, that is, sprinkled with <span class="italic">pimentón</span>, olive oil, and coarse salt. Until refrigeration was widespread, octopuses were salted or air dried. I have heard older friends describe how common it was to see these creatures hanging in the ports and near the beaches, attached with clips to ropes as if they were freshly washed laundry. Fresh octopus tastes much better, my friends say; perhaps this is why the sight has disappeared.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p143">Many dishes beyond the catch of the day are emblematic of Galicia. For example, it is hard to imagine Galician meals without empanadas. The dough is made with wheat flour, sometimes mixed with corn flour, and traditional fillings vary from meats, tuna, cockles, sardines, or scallops to fruits if served for dessert. <span class="italic">Pote</span> and <span class="italic">caldo gallego</span> are the Galician versions of the chickpea and other bean soups and stews so beloved across Spain. Here, however, <span class="italic">grelos</span> (turnip greens) are the green of choice, not just in these dishes but in other soups and stews as well, and <span class="italic">lacón</span> (boiled ham) is often served with the greens. The local potatoes, called <span class="italic">cachelos</span> when they are served boiled with their jackets on, are excellent, as are the <span class="italic">pimientos de Padrón</span>, small green peppers from Padrón, which are usually lightly pierced with a fork and then fried in olive oil. Typically, these peppers are not hot, but when they are, they can bring tears to your eyes. Galicians have the reputation of responding to questions vaguely or even answering with another question. While this may be an unfair generalization, if a Galician serves you <span class="italic">pimientos de Padrón</span> and you ask whether they are hot, be prepared to hear the characteristic Galician answer, “<span class="italic">unos pican, outros non</span>” (some are, others aren’t).</p>
<p class="indent" id="p144">The pastures in Galicia are green and luscious, perfect for grazing cattle, and Galician beef, like its seafood, is justly famous all over Spain. In fact, until the 1960s, when other areas of the country began to pay more attention to improving cattle rearing, Galicia supplied half of the beef consumed in the country. Two breeds, Rubia Gallega and Morena del Noroeste, predominate. The relatively small, agile animals have traditionally been raised not only for their meat, but also for working in the fields and supplying milk.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p145">Beef is sold according to the age at slaughter: <span class="italic">ternera</span>, ten months maximum; <span class="italic">añojo</span>, between ten and eighteen months; and <span class="italic">cebón</span>, between eighteen and thirty months. My favorite is <span class="italic">cebón</span>, which is well marbled and full of flavor. The meat from a young animal is usually cut thin and fried briefly. Veal roasts are also popular, as are stews using beef shanks, but the best cut of all is the <span class="italic">chuletón</span>, equivalent in size to a T-bone, but from a different part of the carcass. It is usually grilled over charcoal, sprinkled with coarse salt, and served with <span class="italic">pimientos de Padrón</span> and fried potatoes.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p146"><a id="page34"/>The importance of cattle raising in Galicia has meant that cow’s milk cheeses play a prominent role on the local table. The best known of them is the soft, semicured Tetilla, with a straw-colored rind, mild flavor, and distinctive flattened-cone shape with a pointed tip (<span class="italic">tetilla</span> means “nipple”). San Simón, also semicured, is lightly smoked over birch, which colors the rind a pale brown. The creamy Arzúa (also known as Queso de Ulloa), similar to Tetilla but aged longer, has a darker rind and deeper flavor.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p147">Galicia’s vineyards have been steadily improving in recent decades, gaining more respect at home and beyond. Albariño is the region’s primary white wine grape, and the Rías Biaxas DO, on the west coast (<span class="italic">rías</span> are inlets on the Atlantic), is its most esteemed cultivation area. The grape is said to be a distant relative to Riesling, and its light and pleasing acidity and fruitiness make a convincing case for such a lineage. Galician whites, which marry perfectly with the local seafood, are also highly praised outside Spain. Though traditionally viewed as pleasant but little more, red wines, made from such grapes as Mencía, Garnacha, and Merenzao, are gradually coming into their own.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p148">Historically, Galicians have migrated to every corner of the world, more so than other Spaniards. In Argentina, for instance, all Spaniards are called Gallegos, as if being from Galicia were the only possibility. But even as they move to the far ends of the world, they keep their distinctive traditions alive. Once I joined a group of Galician friends in Argentina preparing <span class="italic">queimada</span>, the traditional Galician hot drink made from Orujo, which is distilled from grape pomace. I found the experience fascinating. First they combined the Orujo with sugar in a cone-shaped earthenware dish, and then they ignited it with a match, “conjuring” <span class="italic">bruxas</span> (witches) as they stirred the flaming beverage with a ladle—an ancient tradition they had transplanted to their new home. No matter where they travel, Galicians never lose their deep ties to the customs of their green, misty homeland.</p>
<h2 class="headerA" id="c01-sect11"><span class="red"><a class="hlink" id="ind697a"/>Levante</span></h2>
<p class="nonindent" id="p149">Levante is the broad term used to describe the eastern region of the country, where the air is filled with the fragrance of orange blossoms. The name comes from the verb <span class="italic">levantar</span>, “to rise,” as though this is where the sun rises in Spain, and the region includes the autonomous communities of Valencia and Murcia. The former is composed of three provinces: Castellón in the north, bordering Catalonia; Valencia in the middle, the home of paella, arguably Spain’s most renowned dish; and Alicante in the south, known for its almond plantations. Murcia, which borders Alicante and is closely related to it, is respected throughout Spain for its productive market gardens.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p150">All four areas face the Mediterranean to the east and have mountains at their back. The coastline, especially in the north, is fairly straight, with only a few capes and gulfs, and the beaches are mainly sandy and flat. Toward the south, in Murcia, salt marshes can be found near Cartagena. This area, known as Mar Menor, supplied the salt that the Romans used for, among other things, their celebrated <span class="italic">garum</span>, an indispensable sauce made by extracting the liquid from fermented sun-dried salted fish—a salty, potent condiment not unlike the fish sauces of Asia. Farther south, where the mountain ranges descend toward the sea, the coast is rugged and steep.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p151">Alicante and Cartagena were founded during the third century BC by the Carthaginians, and Cartagena was soon the busiest port in the Mediterranean. Levante continued to play an important role during the Roman era and through the years of Moorish domination, which ended definitively in 1238, when James I of Aragón completed what Spain’s celebrated warrior, El Cid Campeador (born Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar), set out to do a century earlier. Thanks to the Moors, this area and southern Catalonia supply the rest of Spain and beyond with their best rice. The two Denominaciones de Origen of Levante, both of exceptional quality, are Arroz de Valencia and Arroz de Calasparra.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p152">Until the thirteenth century, rice grew around the city of Valencia, which lies on the shores of the Turia River, where it meets the Mediterranean. Then, James I, fearing <a id="page35"/>malaria outbreaks, directed the fields be moved farther away, to a flat marshland area known as Albufera (“lake” in Arabic). The Spaniards employed the same irrigation system for their rice fields that the Moors had used—a system that the Moors had adapted from one first introduced by the Romans. These historic fields, which have spread over the centuries, again almost to the city’s edges, remain one of the preeminent rice-growing areas in all of Europe. Calasparra, in the north of Murcia, is Spain’s other important rice cultivation region. Although Murcia’s production is much smaller, the quality of rice is without equal. Bomba, Senia, and Bahía are the main varieties grown in Valencia, while Bomba and Balilla are the primary types cultivated in Calasparra.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p153">Much of this rice, of course, goes into the making of paella. The origin of the word is difficult to trace. It comes from the Latin <span class="italic">patella</span>, the term for the large, round dish the Romans used for presenting their gifts to the gods. But apparently the paella pan as we know it today—and what defines a paella from other rice dishes—came many centuries after the name was first used. What we do know, however, is that regardless of the name or the pan, rice preparations have been as important a part of the culinary landscape for the people of the Levante as <span class="italic">cocidos</span> have been for the people of Castile.</p>
<div class="full_page_image" id="div25"><img alt="" src="images/Barr_9781607746157_epub_035_r1.jpg"/></div>
<p class="caption" id="p154"><span class="italic">A Spanish almond tree being pollinated</span></p>
<p class="indent" id="p155">Like the <span class="italic">cocido</span>, the dish has humble origins. It was created by farmers and agricultural workers who cooked rice in the fields during their midday break. Today it is understood that a paella is a rice dish cooked in a round, shallow metal vessel. The pan, alas, is often wrongly referred to as a <span class="italic">paellera</span>, while the proper name is paella, and the rice preparation cooked in it is correctly <span class="italic">arroz a la paella</span>, though Spaniards typically shorten it. Countless other rice preparations exist, including everything from vegetarian rice to luxurious compositions of rice and fish, shellfish, chicken, rabbit, beans, snails, or other ingredients, in myriad combinations, but these are not considered paellas because they are cooked in other types of vessels.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p156">Valencia and Murcia are also known for their extensive citrus orchards. When you drive along the inland roads, it is a joy to see and smell the blossoms—harbingers of oranges, lemons, limes, clementines, grapefruits, and more—in full splendor. Murcia is renowned, too, for its large patchwork of small market gardens that yield a year-round harvest. Peppers were introduced to the area by the Hieronymite monks from Guadalupe in Extremadura, who, as previously noted, soon planted them in all their monastery gardens, including the one near La Ñora. <span class="italic">Pimentón</span> from Murcia, made from the small, round, sweet <span class="italic">ñora</span> pepper, is, like that of Extremadura, highly regarded. Artichokes, tomatoes, lettuces, cucumbers, onions, snow peas, green beans, eggplants, and such fruits as cherries, apricots, plums, figs, pears, dates, and prickly pears are among the many other foods grown in the gardens and orchards of the region and exported to the rest of the country and beyond.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p157">The local seafood, like the fruits and vegetables, is exceptional here. The large, tender-fleshed shrimp from <a id="page36"/>the salty waters of the Mar Menor are both prized and, primarily because of high demand, scarce. Shrimp and <span class="italic">dorada</span> (gilt-head bream), caught in the same waters, are commonly baked in salt, and the results are spectacular. The method is simple: the fish is buried in coarse salt and cooked at a high temperature, with nothing else added. When the salt crust is cracked open, the seafood is tender and succulent but never salty. Both the shrimp and the bream are also often grilled or fried, as are other locally caught fish, including red mullet, sardines, monkfish, and hake.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p158">While seafood stars in the Levante, beef and veal play supporting roles, though residents do enjoy panfried or grilled steaks and fillets. Chicken, rabbit, and pork are sometimes roasted and stewed, but they more commonly punctuate paellas and other rice dishes. Inland, near the mountains, where the land is less fertile and the sea is distant, game and goat are prepared.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p159">Almond trees, abundant in the region since the time of the Moors, are undemanding, thriving both inland and along the coast. Alicante is the leader in the production of <span class="italic">turrón</span>, an almond-and-honey nougat that comes in two traditional varieties: <span class="italic">turrón duro</span>, hard bars of chopped almonds mixed with honey, and <span class="italic">turrón blando</span>, soft bars made by mixing ground almonds with honey. <span class="italic"><a class="hlink" href="Barr_9781607746157_epub_c11_r1.htm#box9">Turrón</a></span> is a favorite sweet across Spain, especially at Christmastime, and though many contemporary varieties exist—made with hazelnut, pine nut, coconut, and even chocolate—the original almond versions remain the most sought-after at holiday time.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p160">Noteworthy cheeses from Valencia include Alicante, a small, round goat’s milk cheese; La Nucía, made from goat’s or sheep’s milk, or a combination, and named for a small seaside town; Servilleta (from Spanish for “napkin”), which is also made from goat’s or sheep’s milk, or a blend, and is traditionally molded in cloth; and the mixed-milk Tronchón from northern Valencia, which is produced in neighboring Teruel, in Aragón, as well. In Murcia, two well-known goat’s milk cheeses are made, the pure white fresh Queso de Murcia and the aged Queso de Murcia curado, which is washed with red wine from Jumilla or Yecla during the ripening process, yielding a purplish red rind.</p>
<p class="indent" id="p161">Half a dozen areas—Yecla, Jumilla, and Bullas in Murcia, and Valencia, Alicante, and Utiel-Requena in Valencia—make up the main wine-producing regions of the Levante, and for the most part, the same grapes are grown throughout, with white wines made primarily from Macabeo, Merseguera, Malvasía, Airén, and Pedro Ximénez, and red wines from Monastrell, Garnacha Tinta, Tempranillo, Merlot, and Syrah. Though neither Murcia nor Valencia has a history of producing more than ordinary wine, in recent years, money and time have been invested in the local industry with some positive results. Two of the most notable developments are the red wines of Jumilla built on the Monastrell grape and some fine fruity rosés from Utiel-Requena.</p>
