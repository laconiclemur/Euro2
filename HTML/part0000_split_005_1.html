    <li value="1" class="calibre36"><span class="calibre31">52 Weeks of Family French</span><span class="calibre9"> follows an auditory and oral learning model. Listening to the sounds of a new language and communicating successfully in that language opens the mind to a new structure of thinking. Vocabulary drills and grammar rules shut down the learning process at this early stage. This is not to imply vocabulary and grammar are not crucial to the mastery of any language. It is simply that to get the process started, </span><span class="calibre25">the natural way is to start talking</span><span class="calibre9">.</span></li> 
    <li value="2" class="calibre37"><span class="calibre38">Talk, Talk, Talk!</span><span class="calibre9">  Use your new vocabulary every day, even it is only for a one minute conversation. You will be surprised and pleased to see how a minimal time commitment, </span><span class="calibre25">every day</span><span class="calibre9">, leads to the attainment of a great deal of vocabulary.</span></li> 
    <li value="3" class="calibre37"><span class="calibre38">Watch your pronunciation</span><span class="calibre25">. </span><span class="calibre9">Try to correct any major pronunciation errors as soon as they occur. The pronunciation guides should help you with this. The faster you correct yourself, the faster you will learn.</span></li> 
    <li value="4" class="calibre37"><span class="calibre38">Touch on each week’s</span><span class="calibre25"> cultural note.</span><span class="calibre9"> Every week’s lesson includes a fact about a country or culture where French is spoken. Introducing children to different French cultures increases their curiosity about the language. It makes the process more interesting and fun for you as well!</span></li> 
    <li value="5" class="calibre37"><span class="calibre38">Take time to review</span><span class="calibre25">. </span><span class="calibre9">Review weeks are built into the curriculum. Take your time! If you feel you and your family haven’t mastered one week’s concept, continue your review till you are ready to move on.</span></li> 
    <li value="6" class="calibre37"><span class="calibre38">Remember, it’s a journey, not a race</span><span class="calibre39">.</span><span class="calibre25"> </span><span class="calibre9">Many language courses advertise mastery of a language in record time. Babies don’t learn to talk overnight, and people don’t speak new languages overnight either. Your French speaking skills will continue to improve as long as you keep speaking and learning. Enjoy!</span></li>
