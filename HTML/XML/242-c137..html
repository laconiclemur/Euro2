<p class="first">After a sumptuous Christmas Eve meal, it is traditional to serve this sweet yet light compote. Although it can be eaten warm, I prefer it cold. The combination of fruits here is typical, but you can vary them to suit your own tastes.</p>

<li>In a stockpot, combine the apples, pears, and water, and bring the contents to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat, and add the sugar, cinnamon stick, and lemon juice. Simmer the mixture over medium heat for about 15 minutes, stirring to prevent scorching.</li>
<li>While the mixture simmers, combine the prunes, raisins, and apricots with the wine in a saucepan, and bring the contents to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat, and simmer over medium heat for about 10 minutes, until the fruits plump and soften.</li>
<li>Add the prunes, raisins, and apricots and any remaining wine to the pot containing the apples and pears. Stir to mix the fruits, and simmer them for about 10 minutes, until the flavors blend and the apples and pears are soft. Serve the compote warm, or refrigerate it in a covered container, and serve it later chilled.</li>

<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p222"/> Twelfth Night in the Basque Country</h4>
<p class="first"><em>For many children</em> in the Western world, Christmas Eve, December 24, is the most exciting night of the year. For Basque children the most exciting night is January 5, when they prepare for the next day's Twelfth Night celebration. On the fifth, children throughout the Basque Country eagerly polish their shoes, and then each family displays the clean, neat shoes in a circle in the center of the living room. Alongside the shoes, they leave a tray of sweets, three glasses of brandy, and a jug of water. Just as children elsewhere wait for Santa Claus on December 24, Basque children wait for the Three Wise Men to bring them gifts on January 5. The sweets and brandy are for Melchor, Gaspar, and Baltasar, the Wise Men, and the water is for their camels. When the children wake on January 6, they find their shoes filled with gifts and sweet treats—unless they have been very naughty, in which case the shoes are supposed to be stuffed with charcoal. I don't think much charcoal is ever in evidence, though, on that joyous morning.</p>
