<p class="first">My good friend José Bascaran, who raises sheep in upstate New York, supplies me with all of my lamb for the restaurants, and I am never disappointed with the quality. On the contrary—it is extraordinary. Perhaps this is because he takes such good care of his flock; he even plays soft music in the barn at night to help the sheep sleep (I would not believe this if I had not witnessed it with my own eyes and ears). José is a retired jai-alai player who competed in Florida and Connecticut before settling in New York State. His family still raises sheep and cattle in Markina in the Basque Country, and he follows the farming practices that he learned while growing up there.</p>

<li>Preheat the oven to 300°F. Set an oven-proof pan or bowl on the lower rack of the oven, and fill it with water (see Note).</li>
<li>Sprinkle the lamb lightly with salt, and then rub it with the garlic halves. Rub it next with the lard, and then place it in a roasting pan.</li>
<li>Roast the leg on the center rack of the oven for 45 minutes. Turn the leg over, baste it with the pan juices, and sprinkle it with the 1 cup water. Roast the leg for 45 minutes longer, basting several times.</li>
<li>Raise the oven temperature to 450°F and roast the lamb for about 15 minutes longer, until the meat is nicely browned and forms a crunchy crust. Let it rest for a while before carving it.</li>
