<p class="first">Capons, 10- to 12-month-old castrated chickens, are plump and tender birds that have long been traditional Christmastime fare in the Basque Country. In Bilbao, December 21 is the day of the spectacular Santo Tomás Fair, where local farmers sell capons and late-fall produce to bustling shoppers anxious to buy the food for their Christmas feasts. I try not to miss the fair—it's so much a part of the holiday season for me.</p>
<p class="follow">I have noticed capons in more American markets recently than when I first arrived here, perhaps because of an increased interest in free-range poultry. But if you can't find capon locally, you can order it from D'Artagnan (800-DARTAGNAN or 973-344-0565).</p>

<li>Preheat the oven to 400°F.</li>
<li>Lightly sprinkle the chicken inside and out with salt. Rub it inside and out with a little of the olive oil.</li>
<li>Insert the apple wedges and dates into the breast cavity, and put the chicken breast-up in a shallow roasting pan. Place the pan on the center rack of the oven, reduce the heat to 300°F, and roast the chicken for 1½ hours (15 minutes to the pound). Baste the chicken with the pan juices every 10 to 15 minutes. During the final 10 minutes of roasting, raise the oven temperature to 450°F to brown the chicken nicely.</li>
<li>Lift the chicken from the pan, and set it on a platter. Remove the apples and dates from the cavity, and put them into a small bowl. Cover the chicken to keep it warm. Using a fork, mash the apples and dates until the mixture is quite smooth.</li>
<li>Pour the contents of the pan into a saucepan, add the wine and broth, and bring the liquid to a boil over high heat. Boil it for about 10 minutes, until it is reduced by half. Serve the sauce and mashed fruit with the capon.</li>

<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p133"/> Christmas Capon, Cooked in the Old Style</h4>
<p class="first"><em>José Garzón Saez</em> writes about Basque Christmas traditions in his book <em>Platos de Navidad.</em> Before Basque housewives, or <em>etxekoandres,</em> had ovens in their homes, writes Saez, when it came time to cook the Christmas capon these ingenious cooks would cross two wooden spoons near the bottom of a large, deep clay pot, and set the plump bird on them. The spoons held the capon above the fat in the bottom of the pot. The <em>etxekoandres</em> would then cover the pot and cook the capon over medium heat for about three hours. And, without exception, the women rubbed the bird with lard, never olive oil. Some Basques still say that capon tastes best when cooked this way.</p>
