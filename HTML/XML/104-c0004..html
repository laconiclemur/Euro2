<h1 class="chaptertitle"><a id="p181"/> BASQUE BASICS</h1>
<p class="first"/>

<p class="left"><a id="p182"/> T<em>his may seem like an unlikely jumble of recipes—one for mayonnaise, another for vinaigrette, and then more for sauce after sauce—all followed by a few standard broths, a bread, a breakfast cake, two potato side dishes, and the Basque version of applesauce. But these are the basic recipes that every good Basque cook relies on to turn a good meal into a spectacular one, a simple dish into a memorable one. Here is the vinaigrette that I sprinkle over salads and cold vegetables day in and day out. Here, too, are the chicken, beef, and fish broths I use as the bases for soups, stews, and sauces. And here is a recipe for an odd and old-fashioned Basque hearth bread called</em> talo <em>that belongs in no other chapter but without question belongs in this book.</em></p>
<p class="follow"><a id="p183"/> <em>Much of this chapter is dedicated to sauces. We Basques are justly proud of our sauces, a small but powerful repertoire that gives our cooking the distinction it has earned over the centuries. Our most admired sauce is</em> salsa vizcaína, <em>which I discuss at some length later in this chapter. But we also are acclaimed for our</em> salsa pimientos del piquillo <em>and</em> salsa española, <em>among others. Some of the best-known Basque sauces, those that are intrinsic to certain dishes, must be made at the time of serving, and so are not included here but can be found elsewhere in the book within main-dish recipes. For instance, the black ink sauce that accompanies our prized squid is part of the squid recipe <a href="c107.xml#p175">[&gt;]</a>.</em></p>
<p class="follow"><em>The sauces described in this chapter, however, can be prepared in advance and matched with many foods—fish, meat, and poultry. Every Basque cook has at least one of these sauces on hand in the refrigerator at all times to facilitate family meals and just make life easier. In my case, this sensible habit has enabled me to make last-minute meals that everyone in my family enjoys.</em></p>
