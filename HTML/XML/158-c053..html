<p class="first">The good cooks of Tolosa have long been famous for the red-bean stews they make in this market town in Guipúzcoa, the Basque province closest to France. Tolosa, where the familiar Basque berets are manufactured, is less than 20 miles from San Sebastián (Donostia, in Euskera), and is also home to an impressive confectionary museum, which contains candy-making equipment and utensils dating to the fifteenth century. Nestled in a river valley, the town hosts a wonderful farmers' market in the square every Saturday.</p>
<p class="follow">Although there may be as many variations of this dish as there are cooks in town, the recipe here is representative of the region's stews. If you travel to Tolosa, try the outstanding version served at Herriko Etxea, a tavern in the nearby village of Albiztu. As elsewhere in Tolosa, the stew is served with spicy, hot pickled green peppers called <em>guindillas.</em></p>
<p class="follow">I like to make this on cold winter weekends, when I have the three hours necessary for its preparation. The stew is great for family meals, but it is also a tasty and convenient dish for casual entertaining; make it in the morning and reheat it when your guests arrive.</p>

<li><a id="p86"/> In a large pot or bowl, combine the beans with enough cold water to cover them by 1 to 2 inches. Soak the beans for 8 to 10 hours. Drain them, and transfer them to a stockpot.</li>
<li>Add to the pot the leek, the carrot, and half the onion, in one piece, and then add enough cold water to cover the vegetables by 2 to 3 inches. Bring the contents to a boil over high heat, and cook rapidly for 2 to 3 minutes, skimming any foam from the surface. Reduce the heat, and simmer the beans gently for about 1½ hours, until they are fork-tender.</li>
<li>Add the chorizo sausages, and cook for about 1 hour longer, until the sausage is tender.</li>
<li>If you're using the blood sausages, put them into a saucepan, and add enough cold water to barely cover them. Cook them over medium heat for about 30 minutes, until they are tender, adding more water as necessary. Drain them, and set them aside.</li>
<li>In a skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Chop the remaining onion half, and add the onion and paprika to the skillet. Sauté for about 5 minutes, until the onion is soft. Purée the mixture in a food mill or blender. Add the purée to the soup, and season the soup to taste with salt. If you prefer, remove the onion half, the leeks, and the carrot.</li>
<li>Heat the soup through, and add the blood sausage, if you're using it. Ladle the soup into shallow bowls, and serve it immediately, making sure that each serving contains a chorizo sausage and half a blood sausage.</li>

<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p87"/> The Indispensable Food Mill</h4>
<p class="first"><em>Food mills play a major role</em> in Basque kitchens, and I think it's a shame that they aren't more popular in the United States. Because these inexpensive tools are helpful for many kitchen tasks, I frequently suggest that you use one. When food is passed through a food mill, all skins and seeds are extracted and lumps are smoothed out, although the mill never purées food to the degree that a blender or food processor does. This is precisely what I like about food mills. The food comes out more textured, and it keeps its color instead of turning lighter, as often happens when food is pulverized in one of the more powerful machines.</p>
<p class="follow">Sold at kitchenware and general houseware stores, food mills are hand-cranked sieves with perforated bottoms; some come with exchangeable base plates with perforations of different sizes. Some mills also have brackets for hooking them onto the edges of pans and bowls. Most mills hold between 2 and 3½ quarts. Once you begin using a food mill, you too will find it indispensable.</p>
