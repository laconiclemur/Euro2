<p class="first">Anyone who has traveled in the Basque country has sampled this lovely sauce, since it is probably the most famous of all our sauces. But when I sat down to write the book, I debated including this recipe, despite its importance to Basque cuisine, because <em>choricero,</em> the sweet, dried red peppers necessary for it, are not imported to the United States. I tried making the sauce with other mild, sweet dried red peppers, which are easily available all over the United States, but although flavorful, these do not produce a sauce that tastes authentic to me. Still, I finally decided that it is better to tell you how to make a good approximation of the sauce than to deprive you of the recipe altogether.</p>

<li>Put the peppers into a bowl, and soak them in cold water for at least 8 hours. Transfer the peppers and soaking liquid to a saucepan, and heat them over medium heat until they are simmering, but not boiling. Drain the peppers, reserving 1 cup of the liquid. Slit the peppers open, and scrape out the seeds. Discard the seeds.</li>
<li>In a skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic, and sauté them for about 5 minutes, until they are softened. Add the peppers and ham, if you're using it, and cook for about 5 minutes, until the peppers begin to soften. Reduce the heat to low, add the reserved cooking liquid, and season to taste with salt. Cook, stirring, for 20 to 30 minutes, until the peppers are very soft and the sauce is slightly reduced.</li>
<li>Add the tomato sauce (you may want to add a little more or a little less than ½ cup, according to your taste), and cook for about 5 minutes, until the sauce is hot. Pass it through a food mill, and serve it immediately, or store it in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</li>

<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p189"/> A Proud Heritage: Salsa Vizcaína</h4>
<p class="first"><em>Salsa Vizcaína is</em> without doubt the most celebrated Basque sauce. In his book <em>Bocuse: Cuisine des Regions de France,</em> Paul Bocuse includes a recipe for <em>salsa vizcaína</em> in his chapter on the Bordelaise region; although the sauce originated in the Spanish province of Vizcaya, he explains, it is also appreciated in France.</p>
<p class="follow">When a dish is prepared with this full-flavored pepper sauce, it is invariably called "Biscayne-style" <em>(vizcaína)</em>—and there are a number of such dishes in this book. Unhappily, the sweet, dried red peppers necessary for an authentic sauce are not imported to the United States, so you may have to substitute others, which will not produce an absolutely authentic-tasting sauce. (Throughout the Caribbean, you will find sauces called Biscayne, but these are all quite different from the traditional Basque version.)</p>
<p class="follow">These all-important peppers, called <em>choriceros,</em> grow only in the Basque region of Spain. When dried, they are not only used for <em>salsa vizcaína,</em> but they are also crushed and mixed with pork to make chorizo sausages, to which they give a characteristic ruddy color. Not only do I rely on choricero peppers for a taste of Spain, but the farm where I buy them, owned by my friend Felisa Madariaga, is absolutely beautiful, and so I always enjoy this particular shopping trip.</p>
