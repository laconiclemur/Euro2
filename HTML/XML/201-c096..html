<p class="first">These prawns are not actually grilled, but are quickly cooked in a very hot pan, which leaves them juicy and delicious. I raise and lower the heat several times during cooking to insure that they cook perfectly, and I do not shell them. Instead, I let my guests shell them at the table. I suggest serving these with nothing more than a green salad and some good bread. Be sure to have plenty of napkins on hand, because the shrimp taste best when eaten with your fingers instead of knives and forks.</p>

<li>In a glass or ceramic bowl, whisk together the oil, the lemon juice, and the salt. Add the shrimp, and marinate them for only 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Heat a large skillet over high heat until it is very hot. Lay a single layer of shrimp in the pan, and cook them for 1 minute. Reduce the heat to medium, and cook them for 1 minute longer. Raise the heat to high again, turn the shrimp, and cook them for 1 minute. Reduce the heat to medium, and cook for another minute, until the shrimp are pink. Lift the shrimp from the pan with a slotted spoon, set them aside, and cover them to keep them warm. Cook the remaining shrimp in the same way.</li>
<li>Arrange five shrimp on each plate to form a star, with the head ends meeting in the center of the plates. Serve immediately.</li>
