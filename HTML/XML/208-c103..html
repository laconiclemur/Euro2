<p class="first">Red mullet, imported from Europe to the United States, are not available at all fish markets. But if you can find them, try them. They are small fish, ranging from 4 to 8 ounces each, and are intensely red or salmon-colored. I call these "Santurce-style" because I always order them cooked this way at a tavern in the port town of Santurce. We usually eat them with no accompaniment, using our fingers or forks to separate the fish from the tiny bones. If you do not want to bother with the bones, ask the fishmonger to fillet the fish, and prepare them as I do the Baked Salmon with Vinaigrette (<a href="c102.xml#p168">[&gt;]</a>), reducing the baking time by half.</p>

<li>Lightly sprinkle the mullets inside and out with salt. Spread the flour on a plate, and coat the fish on both sides with flour. Shake off the excess.</li>
<li>In a skillet, heat the oil over high heat. Fry the fish for 1 minute. Reduce the heat to medium-high, turn the fish, and fry them for 2 to 3 minutes longer if they're small, or about 5 minutes if they're large. Drain them on two layers of paper towels. Serve the fish hot.</li>

<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p170"/> Fishing for Tuna on the High Seas</h4>
<p class="first"><em>Anyone who has</em> fished for albacore tuna, or <em>bonito,</em> as we Basques call it, will agree that this is an exhilarating experience—providing the weather is good. During the summer, my friends and I would set off to fish for tuna at four in the morning so that we would be far enough out on the waters by daybreak to find the schools of magnificent leaping fish. Basques call <em>bonito</em> "vagabonds of the seas" because each year they travel great distances: In the spring they form schools in the Gulf of Biscay, and in summer they come closer to shore. In fall and winter, they swim in far deeper waters. It's a glorious spectacle when the silver-blue fish leap from the foam they create as they slap the surface of the water, chasing schools of smaller fish and moving like quicksilver through the waves. From above the blue water, sea birds also attack the smaller fish. The entire scene is one of nature's most powerful ballets.</p>
