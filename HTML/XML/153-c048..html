<p class="first">When I was a university student in Bilbao, my friends and I were known to hire a large car or even a bus with a driver to make the trip to a tavern-like restaurant called Txiller in the tiny village of Larruskain—actually only a cluster of a few houses—on the outskirts of Markina, in the province of Vizcaya. We traveled over narrow country roads for more than an hour just so that we could spend an evening there enjoying this wonderful, robust soup and grilled monkfish. It was one of our favorite outings!</p>
<p class="follow">Victoria Churruca, Txiller's owner, graciously shared this recipe with me. Larruskain is only a few miles from Ondarroa, a fishing port, which explains the fish and seafood in this soup. For more texture, lay a slice of bread in the bottom of each soup bowl before ladling in the soup.</p>

<li><a id="p78"/> In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion, carrots, and leek, reduce the heat to low, and sauté the vegetables for about 10 minutes, until they soften. Add the tomato, stir, and simmer for about 5 minutes, until the tomato releases its liquid.</li>
<li>While the vegetables cook, sprinkle the monkfish and shrimp with salt. Spread the flour in a shallow bowl, coat the fish and shrimp with the flour, and shake off the excess. Add the fish and shrimp to the pot of vegetables, and cook, stirring, for about 5 minutes. Add the wine, and simmer for 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat.</li>
<li>In a large saucepan or stockpot, bring about 6 cups water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the mussels and clams, and cook them for 3 to 5 minutes, until they open. Lift the clams and mussels from the pan with a slotted spoon, and set them aside. Discard any that have not opened. Add the reserved fish bones and shrimp shells to the cooking liquid. Bring the liquid to a boil over medium-high heat, reduce the heat, and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Strain the cooking liquid into another large pot. Add the saffron threads, and season to taste with salt. Add the fish, shrimp, and vegetables from step 2, and the clams and mussels, and bring the soup to a boil. Reduce the heat, and simmer 2 to 3 minutes to blend the flavors. Serve immediately.</li>

<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p79"/> A Word About Cutting Potatoes</h4>
<p class="first"><em>When cutting potatoes</em> for stews and soups, cut only part of the way into the potato, and then crack or break it the rest of the way. The cracked part will release the potato's starch into the cooking liquid, and the starch will act as a natural thickener. In the Basque Country, this is called an "old grandmother's trick."</p>
