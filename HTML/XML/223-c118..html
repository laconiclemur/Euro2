<p class="first">When I cook at home, my youngest son, Lucas, loves to be involved, and he often insists on preparing this easy cake. Except for putting it in and taking it from the oven, he can make the entire cake by himself. I have to clean up after him, but his feeling of accomplishment is well worth the extra dusting of flour in the kitchen.</p>

<li>Preheat the oven to 300°F. Generously butter a large loaf pan (approximately 10 by 6 by 2½ inches) or an 8-inch-square baking pan, and dust it with flour. Tap out the excess flour.</li>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs with the zest. Add the cup of sugar, the cream, 1 cup of the flour, and the baking powder. Using a wire whisk, blend the contents. Still whisking, add the remaining ½ cup flour. Whisk until the flour is well incorporated. Scrape the batter into the pan.</li>
<li>Bake the cake on the center rack of the oven for 45 minutes. Raise the oven temperature to 350°F, and bake the cake for about 30 minutes longer, until the edges pull away from the sides of the pan and the top is golden. (Check the cake often during the last 15 minutes of baking, in case your oven is hotter than average.)</li>
<li>Let the cake cool in its pan on a wire rack. When the cake is cool, turn it out, and serve it at room temperature.</li>

<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p193"/> Basque Breakfast</h4>
<p class="first"><em>Breakfast in the</em> Basque country is not the full meal it is in northern Europe. We rarely eat more than a slice of toasted bread accompanied by a cup of strong coffee or tea. On occasion we might indulge in a cake, such as the Breakfast Sponge Cake.</p>
<p class="follow">My father still drinks a small glass of olive oil mixed with a little lemon juice for breakfast. We were never obliged to follow suit, but he encouraged us by saying, "<em>Si quieres llegar a viejo, guarda aceite en el pellejo</em>." Translation: "If you want to get old, store some olive oil in your skin."</p>
