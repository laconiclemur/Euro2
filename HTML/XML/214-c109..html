<p class="first">In the port town of Getaria, squid are often cooked the traditional Basque way, in black ink sauce. But nearly as often they are sautéed in olive oil with a good amount of chopped onions, which are served spooned over the squid; this dish is called <em>Chipirones Pelayo.</em> Maria Angeles, a waitress who works at Kaia, a harborside restaurant, explained the name this way: Years ago a local squid fisherman named Pelayo, tiring of the black ink sauce that is so common in Basque cooking, urged his wife to try another method of preparing his catch. She was so successful that the simple preparation was adopted by Kaia and other restaurants in the Basque Country and christened with the fisherman's name. My mother, too, searched for other ways to cook the pounds of squid my father caught during our summer holidays and, on her own, came up with a similar recipe. Her recipe may not be as famous as Pelayo's, but I like it better. See the variation following this recipe.</p>

<li>In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onions, and sauté them for about 10 minutes, until they are softened.</li>
<li>Lightly sprinkle the squid with salt, and add the squid to the pan, pushing the onions to the side so that the squid touch the bottom of the pan. Cook them for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, until they are lightly browned. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook them for about 15 minutes, stirring from time to time, until they are tender and cooked through.</li>
<li>Serve the squid topped with the onions from the pan.</li>

Let them thaw in the refrigerator before proceeding with the recipe. The dish won't taste exactly the same, but it will still be delicious.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="left"><b>V<span style="font-size: smaller">ARIATION</span></b></p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="left"><b>M<span style="font-size: smaller">ARICHU'S</span> S<span style="font-size: smaller">AUTÉED</span> S<span style="font-size: smaller">QUID WITH</span> O<span style="font-size: smaller">NIONS</span></b></p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="left"><b>Chipirones Encebollados Marichu</b></p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="left">Sauté 2 tablespoons julienned green bell pepper along with the onions. When the vegetables are softened, stir in 2 tablespoons brandy, and heat gently. Cook the squid as indicated but in a separate pan, in 3 to 4 tablespoons of olive oil. Just before serving, add the cooked squid to the pan with the onions and peppers, and heat all the contents through. Serve the squid with the onion-pepper sauce spooned over them.</p></blockquote>
