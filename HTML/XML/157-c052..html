<p class="first">The special flavor and texture of Spanish Basque onion soup comes from aged Idiazabal, a sheep's milk cheese that is smoked over hardwood fires (see <a href="c052.xml#p84">[&gt;]</a>). If you can't find aged Idiazabal, however, you can use Gruyère cheese, as the French Basques do.</p>

<li>In a large pot, heat the oil and butter over medium heat. Sauté the onions for 20 to 30 minutes, until they are soft.</li>
<li>Add the broth, bring it to a simmer, and cook the soup for about 10 minutes longer, until it is hot and the liquid is infused with the onions. Season the soup to taste with salt.</li>
<li>Lay two slices of bread in the bottom of each of four shallow soup plates, and sprinkle each serving with 3 tablespoons of the cheese. Ladle the soup over the bread and cheese, and serve immediately.</li>

<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p84"/> Idiazabal Cheese</h4>
<p class="first"><em>In the mountains</em> and valleys in and near the Basque Country, the climate is perfect for raising healthy cows, goats, and sheep, all of which produce rich, creamy milk. From this milk Spain produces some exceptional cheeses. The most celebrated of the Basque cheeses is Idiazabal, a smoked sheep's milk cheese. It has become a great favorite not only in its region of origin but throughout the rest of Spain and much of Europe, and exports to the United States and elsewhere are growing. Basques themselves are so crazy about this cheese that they hold contests to match artisan cheesemakers against each other. Recently, a prize-winning wheel of Idiazabal cheese was auctioned at the Ordizia market (near Tolosa) for about five thousand dollars.</p>
<p class="follow">The handmade cheese is encased in a hard, dark brown, inedible rind. After a few months' aging, the cheese inside is light-colored with a lovely buttery, nutty flavor. When aged for a long period, Idiazabal cheese becomes firm, dry, and sharp—perfect for grating for Onion Soup Basque-Style.</p>
<p class="follow">If you can't find Idiazabal cheese locally, order it from Northern Boulevard (718-779-4971).</p>
