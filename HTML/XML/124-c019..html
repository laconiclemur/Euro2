<p class="first">If I had to choose just one dish that reminds me the most of my mother, Marichu, it would have to be this one. When I moved to Madrid as a young woman, I always journeyed home for Christmas. On my way I literally dreamed about these snails, which are traditional holiday fare among the Basques. But, more often than not, the delectable morsels, painstakingly prepared, were nearly gone by the time the dish got to me! This is because in my parents' house the men are served first, and my brothers never held back when it came to the snails—or any other food. This was torture for me! I so loved them.</p>
<p class="follow">Although it takes a while to make this dish, I do so in the restaurant over the holidays, using my mother's recipe. One year, an Italian customer came to me with tears in his eyes, saying that snails were his favorite Christmas dish, and that we had prepared them exactly as his family had in Italy.</p>

<p class="follow"><a id="p37"/> The snails taste even better if cooked a day ahead of time, refrigerated, and then gently reheated before serving.</p>

<li>To clean the snails, put them into a large colander, put the colander on a plate or in a bowl, and sprinkle the snails with two or three generous fistfuls of coarse salt. Rub the salt over the snails with your hands, then refrigerate the snails with the colander and plate for 2 to 8 hours, or leave them at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours. The snails will release a viscous secretion. Rinse them well under cool running water. Repeat the salting and rinsing process two or three times, until the water runs clear when the snails are rinsed. Transfer the snails to a stockpot.</li>
<li>Add enough water to the stockpot to cover the snails by 1 to 2 inches. Bring the water to a boil, and cook the snails over medium-high heat for about 30 minutes. (At this point, the snails will smell unpleasant.) Drain the snails and rinse them thoroughly under cool, running water. Return the snails to the stockpot. They now are clean.</li>
<li>Add fresh water to the snails to cover them by 2 to 3 inches. Add the leek, carrot, whole onion, parsley, and bay leaves, and season with a teaspoon or so of salt. Bring the contents to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat, and simmer vigorously for about 1 hour. Drain the snails, and set them aside. Discard the vegetables and bay leaves.</li>
<li>Heat the olive oil in a skillet or sauté pan over low heat, and sauté the minced onion for 6 to 7 minutes, until it is softened. Add the ham and sausage, and sauté for about 5 minutes, until the sausage is lightly browned. Add the Biscayne Sauce, and cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes until it is heated through and well mixed.</li>
<li>Stir in the snails, mixing them well with the sauce. Add the egg yolks and pepper flakes, stir gently, and cook for about 10 minutes, until the flavors blend. Serve by spooning the mixture onto small plates. Use toothpicks to extract the snails from the shells.</li>
