<p class="first">Basques have only quite recently added cream to sauces, and so this is an example of a modern Basque recipe that has roots in our culinary history. When I was asked to be the guest chef for a gala dinner at New York City's Pierre Hotel honoring Severiano Ballesteros, the acclaimed Spanish golfer, I served this sauce with red snapper. At the restaurant, I serve it often with striped bass, scallops, and other mild-flavored fish.</p>

<li>In a saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring to prevent burning, until the onion softens.</li>
<li>Add the peppers, and cook for 5 minutes longer, until they begin to soften.</li>
<li>Raise the heat to medium-high, and stir in the flour. Stir until all the ingredients are well mixed. Add the broth and wine, and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is heated through. Season to taste with salt, and stir in the cream. Bring the mixture to a simmer, and cook it for about 5 minutes without letting it boil. Transfer it to a blender, and blend the mixture to a purée. Strain the sauce through a fine-mesh sieve, and serve.</li>

<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p191"/> Piquillo Peppers</h4>
<p class="first"><em>Piquillo is the</em> <em>diminutive</em> of <em>pico,</em> Spanish for "peak." The name is apt, since these triangular peppers end in a very acute point. About 3 inches long, they grow exclusively in Navarra; the best ones come from the subregion of Lodosa. Because piquillos are intensely red when ripe, they are often called Navarra's "red gold."</p>
<p class="follow">After the harvest, these peppers are roasted over wood and peeled by hand. For the optimal preservation of their taste and aroma, they are never rinsed in water. At the end of this laborious process, they are sealed in cans or jars with nothing but their own juices.</p>
<p class="follow">Because of their high levels of fiber, vitamin C, and carotene, and their low caloric content, piquillos are very healthful. They can be eaten straight from the can with a little vinaigrette, blended in Piquillo Pepper Sauce (<a href="c116.xml#p190">[&gt;]</a>), or used in any number of different dishes, such as the ones suggested in this book.</p>
<p class="follow">Large specialty-foods stores carry canned piquillo peppers. If you don't have a local source, you can order them from Northern Boulevard, in Queens, New York. The store's telephone number is 718-779-4971.</p>
