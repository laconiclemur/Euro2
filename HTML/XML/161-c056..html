<p class="first">The French chef Paul Bocuse was asked to prepare a meal for the hundredth anniversary of the Bodegas Cune winery in the Rioja region of Spain, which borders the Basque Country and shares many of its traditions. When he visited the kitchen, the esteemed chef sampled this simple potato stew, which the winery's cook had prepared for her own supper. He was so delighted with the stew, he reportedly announced to the winery's owners that they had no need for his food when they had such a treasure right before them! I share Chef Bocuse's enthusiasm for this earthy and very easy dish. Try it with a glass of smooth Rioja red wine.</p>

<li>In a stockpot or other large pot, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion, and cook it for about 5 minutes, until it is softened. Add the sausage, and cook, stirring, for about 1 minute, or just until the meat begins to brown.</li>
<li>Add the potatoes, paprika, and salt, and stir well. Add the water, increase the heat, and bring the contents to a boil. (Add a little more water, at least enough to cover the potatoes by 1 inch, if you prefer the stew more soupy.) Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover the pot, and simmer gently for about 30 minutes, until the potatoes are tender. Ladle the stew into shallow bowls, and serve.</li>

<blockquote><p class="left"><b>N<span style="font-size: smaller">OTES</span>:</b> <em>The original recipe calls for "chestnut-size" pieces of potato. It's important to use starchy potatoes, such as russets, since the potato starch is the only thickener. To ensure a thick stew, also, see "A Word about Cutting Potatoes" <a href="c048.xml#p79">[&gt;]</a>. If the stew seems to need a little extra thickening, crush a few potatoes against the side of the pot before serving.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="follow"><em>Excellent Spanish chorizo is available from Northern Boulevard (718-779-4971).</em></p></blockquote>
