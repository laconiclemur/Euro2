<p class="first">S<em>alsa verde,</em> or green sauce, is used frequently with various fish and vegetables. Hake is a favorite fish in the Basque Country, but this preparation is equally delicious with monkfish or any other firm-fleshed fish. My family ate this and similar dishes in the summertime, when we spent three long, happy months at the seashore. But even during the summer, my parents were strict about everyone showing up for meals on time: 8:00 <span style="font-size: smaller">A.M.</span> for breakfast, 2:00 <span style="font-size: smaller">P.M.</span> for lunch, and 9:30 <span style="font-size: smaller">P.M.</span> for dinner. I remember my older brothers and sisters complaining because they would have to leave their friends in order to be punctual—but we could never miss a family meal. Since my mother was such a good cook, though, no one really minded.</p>

<li>In a small saucepan, combine the clams with the water, and bring them to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-high, and cook for about 5 minutes, until the clams open. Drain the clams, reserving ½ cup of the cooking liquid. Discard any clams that do not open, and set the rest aside.</li>
<li>Spread the flour in a shallow bowl or dish. Sprinkle the fillet pieces on both sides with salt. Dredge the fillet pieces in the flour, turning them to coat all sides. Shake the excess flour from the fish pieces, and set them aside.</li>
<li>In a large skillet or sauté pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the garlic, and sauté it for about 1 minute, until the garlic is light golden.</li>
<li>Lay the hake in the pan in a single layer, and cook it over medium-low heat for 1 to 2 minutes per side, until it is opaque throughout.</li>
<li>Add the wine, the ½ cup minced parsley, and the reserved clam liquid, and simmer for 1 minute, gently shaking the pan to prevent sticking. Add the clams and shrimp, and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes, until the shrimp turn pink. Garnish with a little more parsley, if you like, and serve.</li>

If they are not available, substitute littleneck or slightly larger cherrystone clams. Cockles are a good substitute, too, although they may be hard to find.</em></p></blockquote>
