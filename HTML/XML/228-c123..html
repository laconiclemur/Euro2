<p class="first">I invented the term <em>Basque fries</em> to contrast these potatoes with French fries. Basque fries are already cooked when submerged in hot oil. After only the briefest time in the oil, they are ready to eat—soft on the inside and crispy and crunchy on the outside. This method uses less oil and avoids any fuss about its temperature.</p>

<li>Put the potatoes into a saucepan, and add enough water to cover them by several inches. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat, reduce the heat to low, and cook the potatoes for about 20 minutes, until they are fork-tender. Drain the potatoes, and set them aside to cool.</li>
<li>Peel the potatoes, and cut them into strips or crosswise slices.</li>

<li>In a deep skillet, heat the oil over high heat until it is very hot. Add the potatoes, and cook them for about 1 minute, or just until they are golden. Drain them on two layers of paper towels, salt them to taste, and serve them hot.</li>

<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p199"/> Spanish Olive Oil</h4>
<p class="first"><em>Since Spain is</em> the world's largest producer and exporter of olive oil, we Basques have easy access to the golden oil. We use it almost to the exclusion of any other cooking fat (we use lard only occasionally, to rub birds or pork before roasting, and butter only in a very few recipes for baked goods). The flavor of olive oil, which can range from mild to bold and fruity, enhances most of our food; without it, our dishes would not be as good. The best-tasting olive oil is extra-virgin. The highest quality cold-pressed olive oil, extra-virgin olive oil can appear lusciously green in color. We use it for its delicious flavor in raw preparations and vinaigrettes.</p>
<p class="follow">When it is not possible to get extra-virgin oil, virgin olive oil makes a good substitute. For oil to be labeled "virgin," the olives cannot have been stored for longer than two days between harvest and pressing, and no heat can be applied during the pressing process.</p>
<p class="follow">For most day-to-day cooking tasks, Basque home cooks use ordinary olive oil. This oil can be made from olives that are not quite as fine as those reserved for extra-virgin and virgin oils, and that may have been stored for a little longer than three days. We rarely use "light" or "extra-light" oil; in fact, these appellations seem to be an American invention. Light olive oils contain just as many calories (nine per gram) as any other vegetable oil, but they are made from oils that have been processed to the point where they are odorless and very pale. These refined oils are then blended with very small amounts of virgin olive oil.</p>
<p class="follow">Olive oil is such a common ingredient in Basque kitchens that we rarely worry about how to store it. We pour it into frying pans and over raw foods with judicious audacity, usually keeping a tall bottle fitted with a pouring spout near the work area. I feel olive oil is best if kept in glass bottles, so even when I buy it in large metal cans I transfer it to glass bottles. If you must store olive oil for more than a few months, keep it in a dark, cool place.</p>
<p class="follow">Good olive oil is not only delicious; it is also one of the most healthful fats you can use in your daily diet. The International Olive Oil Council is spreading the word about the health benefits of consuming the golden liquid. For nutritional information about olive oil, you can call the council at 800-232-6548 Monday through Friday, 9:00 <span style="font-size: smaller">A.M.</span> to 5:00 <span style="font-size: smaller">P.M.</span> EST.</p>
