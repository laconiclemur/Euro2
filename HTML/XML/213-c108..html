<p class="first">This is among the most typical of Basque dishes. The squid ink turns the dish completely black, which may look a little strange to the uninitiated, but the delicate flavor of the ink makes the dish an immediate winner. When I was a girl, we spent the summers in the fishing village of Mundaka. My father, who loved to fish, often caught so much that even our large family could not eat all his catch. I recall waiting at the port for my father's boat, and then taking buckets of squid and fish to distribute to my father's numerous friends. I was often tipped very generously by these friends, who provided a secret income that I did not declare to the "paternal IRS."</p>

<ol>
<li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over low heat, and cook the onions, leeks, garlic, parsley, and tomato for about 10 minutes, until the onions and leeks soften and turn almost transparent and the tomato releases its liquid.</li>
<li>Turn the squid inside out, and insert the winglets, heads, and tentacles of the squid into the body cavities, making small packages.</li>
<li>Add a few squid to the pan, and cook them for about 5 minutes on each side, sprinkling them lightly with salt. Using tongs, gently lift the squid from the pan. Drain them in a strainer, pressing gently to remove excess liquid. Transfer them to a flame-proof casserole. Cook the remaining squid in the same way.</li>
<li>Add the squid ink to the pan, and boil the mixture over high heat, stirring, for about 10 minutes, until it is blended and black. Transfer the contents of the pan to a blender or food processor fitted with a metal blade, and blend until the sauce is smooth.</li>
<li>Pour the sauce over the squid, and bring the squid and its sauce to a simmer over medium heat. Cook for about 5 minutes, until the dish is heated through. Serve it with the rice.</li>

<blockquote><p class="left"><b>N<span style="font-size: smaller">OTE</span>:</b> <em>Squid ink is sold frozen in plastic bags in good fish markets and some specialty-foods stores. You can, of course, use the ink from the squid, but you will need more squid—perhaps twice as many. A more practical substitute might be cuttlefish ink, which is very similar to squid ink. For 1 tablespoon ink, you'll need just one or two cuttlefish.</em></p></blockquote>

<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p177"/> Buying and Cleaning Squid</h4>
<p class="first"><em>Squid are plentiful</em> in ocean waters, Atlantic and Pacific. They are inexpensive, too. As when selecting any seafood, though, be sure the squid you buy smells fresh and slightly briny.</p>
<p class="follow">Cleaning squid, though not complicated, is generally the most time-consuming part of preparing any squid dish. If you prefer to avoid the task, buy frozen squid already cut into rings, and use them instead. The dish will not be quite the same, but it will still taste good, since freezing doesn't alter the texture of squid. You will need 2 pounds of squid rings to substitute for 24 baby squid.</p>
<p class="follow">To clean squid yourself, hold them over a colander, and rinse them under cold running water. Peel the pale brown skin from the body to expose the white flesh. Carefully tear off the winglets, and drop them into the colander (unless you are making Pan-Seared Baby Squid <a href="c110.xml#p179">[&gt;]</a>, in which case you should leave the winglets intact). Separate the head and tentacles from the body, and peel as much skin from the tentacles and head as possible. Discard the mouth (a tiny round opening) and eyes; use care when removing them (or discard the entire heads, if you prefer). Drop the peeled tentacles and head into the colander. Remove and discard the hard "pen" and all soft parts from inside the body. Turn the body inside out, and rinse the squid well. This step is important because it allows thorough cleaning of the inside and because it causes the cavity opening to shrink during cooking so that the stuffing (tentacles, winglets, and head) is held inside the body. If you're making Pan-Seared Baby Squid, turn each body right side out again.</p>
<p class="follow">If you want to use the squid's own ink, locate the gland among the soft parts of the body, and carefully separate it. Otherwise, discard the gland and use store-bought squid ink; it is available frozen at some fish markets and specialty-foods stores.</p>
<p class="follow">Insert the winglets, head, and tentacles into the body cavity, making a small package. With practice, cleaning time per squid should be about 3 to 4 minutes.</p>
