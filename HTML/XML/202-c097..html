<p class="first">The Basques are fortunate to live by the Bay of Biscay, one of the best places in the world for anchovy fishing. This means we commonly eat fresh anchovies—tender little treats indeed. In the United States, anchovies are most often found canned, packed in salt and oil. Even when you find a fishmonger who advertises fresh anchovies, he may actually be selling fresh sardines (immature pilchards), which closely resemble anchovies. If you find either fresh anchovies or small sardines, try this little meal. It's perfect for a light summer meal, and leftover anchovies are great the next day topping a slice of crusty bread for a <em>bocadillo</em>—the Spanish version of a sandwich.</p>

<li>Lightly sprinkle the anchovies with salt and then with flour. Shake off any excess flour.</li>
<li>Put the eggs into a shallow bowl. Dip the anchovies in the egg.</li>
<li>In a large skillet, heat the oil over high heat. Add a single layer of anchovies, reduce the heat to medium, and cook for 1 minute. Raise the heat to high, turn the anchovies over, and cook them for about 1 minute longer, until they are cooked through. Remove them with a slotted spoon, and drain them on two layers of paper towels. Cook the remaining anchovies in the same way. Serve the anchovies as soon as they are cooked or at room temperature.</li>

<blockquote><p class="left"><b>N<span style="font-size: smaller">OTES</span>:</b> <em>If the fishmonger cleans the anchovies for you, ask him not to separate the fillets. To clean the anchovies yourself, rinse them under running water, cut off the heads, split the fish open along the bellies, and remove the innards. Carefully lift the central bone from the fish, but do not separate the fillets. Pat them dry with a paper towel.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="follow"><em>You can substitute small fresh sardines for the anchovies.</em></p></blockquote>

<p class="first"><em>In the Basque Country</em> we are fond of <em>bocadillos,</em> our version of the American sandwich. But Basque bocadillos are never made on pre-sliced supermarket breads; we use baguettes or rolls only. We do not toast the bread, nor do we slather it with mayonnaise or mustard. Bocadillos are made with just about any sort of cold meat or fish, with a preference given to those that have been breaded and pan-fried, because this method of preparation keeps the food moist. Cheese and cold omelets are popular for bocadillos, too—the most common omelets for these sandwiches are French (plain) omelets or potato omelets.</p>
<p class="follow">We eat bocadillos for <em>merienda,</em> a late-day snack or very light meal usually taken when the children come home from school (about 5:00 <span style="font-size: smaller">P.M.</span> in Spain) or when we come in from the office. This is because dinner is eaten far later than it is in the United States, and the merienda staves off hunger. We also take bocadillos with us when we hike, go on a long car trip, or picnic in the countryside.</p>
