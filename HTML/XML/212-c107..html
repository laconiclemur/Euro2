<p class="first">In Basque cuisine, the term <em>bilbaína</em> refers to a green sauce <em>(salsa verde)</em> that contains asparagus, green peas, and hard-cooked eggs. A Basque woman named Placida de Larrea developed this sauce in 1723, so it is as much a classic as well-known French sauces, such as hollandaise and bearnaise. Because of the outstanding reputation of Bilbao's food, however, some cooks and chefs call other sauces <em>bilbaína</em> simply for prestige.</p>
<p class="follow">I love grouper with this sauce, but you could also use hake, monkfish, or any other white fish. The sauce does not work well with oilier, darker-fleshed fishes such as tuna or salmon.</p>

<li>Sprinkle the grouper with salt. Spread the flour on a plate, and coat the fish with it on all sides. Shake off the excess flour, and set the fish aside.</li>
<li>In a large saucepan, combine the clams and water, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and boil for about 5 minutes, until the clams open. Drain them, using a fine-mesh sieve, and reserve ½ cup of the cooking liquid. Discard any clams that have not opened.</li>
<li>In a large flame-proof earthenware casserole or skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic, and sauté it for about 1 minute, until it is light golden. Arrange the grouper pieces in a single layer in the casserole or skillet, and cook them over medium heat for about 2 minutes on each side. Add the parsley, the wine, and the reserved clam cooking liquid, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, gently shaking the pan to prevent sticking. Add the clams, asparagus, and peas, and simmer for about 3 minutes longer, until the clams and vegetables are heated through. Remove the casserole or skillet from the heat, add the egg wedges, and serve immediately.</li>

<blockquote><p class="left"><b>N<span style="font-size: smaller">OTE</span>:</b> <em>You should be able to get Manila clams from a reputable fishmonger, although you may have to special-order them. If they are not available, use littleneck or slightly larger cherrystone clams. Cockles are a good substitute, too, although they may be hard to find.</em></p></blockquote>

<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p175"/> Getaria</h4>
<p class="first"><em>Getaria is a</em> well-known fishing town that is almost an obligatory stop when visiting the Basque Country. Close to San Sebastián (Donostia, in Euskera), it is easy to find. Getaria is not only the birthplace of the sixteenth-century global navigator Juan Sebastián Elcano, but also the site of the acclaimed Txomin Etxaniz vineyards. The largest producer of <em>txakolí</em>—a mildly effervescent white wine that is a wonderful accompaniment for fish and seafood—the winery is well worth visiting. Getaria's restaurants are first-rate, and its harbor picturesque. Kaia, an excellent harborside restaurant, is a perfect perch from which to watch the fishing boats come and go and unload their daily catch.</p>
