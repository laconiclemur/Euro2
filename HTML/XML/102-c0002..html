<h1 class="chaptertitle"><a id="p23"/> FIRST COURSES</h1>
<p class="first"/>

<p class="left"><a id="p24"/> <em>In the Basque Country, as indeed throughout all of Spain, lunch and dinner each have three courses—a first course, a main course, and a dessert. The first course frequently includes greens and other vegetables, sometimes in the form of a salad, soup, or stew; the main course consists of meat or seafood usually unaccompanied by a vegetable side dish. First courses also might include small amounts of meat or seafood, served with complementary vegetables or alone.</em></p>

<p class="follow"><a id="p25"/> <em>In Basque restaurants serving</em> nueva cocina <em>(nouvelle cuisine), innovative chefs have created an endless variety of salads, relying on the wonderful fresh vegetables, farmhouse cheeses, and impeccable seafood available in our region. I have not included these imaginative salads in this book, but instead have assembled a group of more traditional salads that will satisfy the need for fresh greens and that, when made with good ingredients, will rival any nouvelle chef's. My favorite salad, and the one that I think best exemplifies our traditional cuisine, is the Marichu Salad (<a href="c037.xml#p63">[&gt;]</a>) which can be composed of nothing more than lettuce, tomatoes, and onions, or can be made more elaborate with the addition of other ingredients, such as hard-boiled eggs, olives, tuna, boiled potatoes, asparagus, or anchovies.</em></p>
<p class="follow"><em>At any time of the day or year in the Basque Country, it's quite common to find a stockpot of soup or a large pot of stew simmering on the back burner of a kitchen stove. This is one tradition that has not changed much since I was a girl. Particularly in the cooler months, we frequently begin our midday or evening meal with a bowl of steaming lentil, leek and potato, or onion soup, or red bean or tuna stew. We make soups and stews using fresh vegetables and fish, chorizo sausages, legumes, and other simple and easily available ingredients; these are not elegant preparations, but they are warm, comforting, and satisfying. Although they are always served as</em> <em>first courses in the Basque Country, you could serve any of the soups and stews in this chapter as the centerpiece of a light meal.</em></p>
<p class="follow"><a id="p26"/> <em>Most important for our first courses, as with all Basque food, is to use the best and freshest ingredients possible. This means fresh-from-the-sea clams and shrimp, precious baby eels, and silvery fresh anchovies; it means tender sweetbreads and bold serrano ham, garden-fresh green beans, and earthy mushrooms. Because these are first courses, quantities can be small, but care and attention is lavished in choosing and preparing the food.</em></p>
