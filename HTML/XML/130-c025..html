<p class="first">Marinated fresh anchovies are very commonly served before lunch or dinner in the Basque Country. Fresh anchovies are not nearly as salty or strong tasting as those you buy canned, and they last for days when marinated in the refrigerator. The fish look rather like sardines, although they are never more than 3 inches long; they have a blue-silver coloring that shimmers and shines in the light. When I find fresh anchovies, I always buy twice the amount I need. I pan-fry half and marinate the rest, as described here.</p>
<p class="follow">If you can't find fresh anchovies, substitute small fresh sardines.</p>

<li>In a shallow glass or ceramic bowl, arrange the anchovy fillets skin-side down. Add the vinegar and the peroxide, if you're using it. Cover the bowl, and refrigerate it for at least 24 hours.</li>
<li>Drain the anchovies. Lay them in single layers in a shallow serving dish or individual dishes, and sprinkle them with salt and the garlic and parsley. Add the olive oil, cover the anchovies, and refrigerate them for up to 7 days.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote><p class="left"><b>N<span style="font-size: smaller">OTES</span>:</b> <em>To clean the anchovies, cut off the heads, and rinse the fish under cool running water. Slit each fish in half, and lift out the central bone. Scrape away any membranes or intestines. Separate the fillets, and drain them on paper towels.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="follow"><em>Hydrogen peroxide—in the dilute form you probably have in your medicine cabinet—is used to whiten the anchovies, which for authenticity should look very pale when marinated. If you prefer, though, you can leave it out.</em></p></blockquote>

<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p50"/> Txokos, Men's Clubs of Taste</h4>
<p class="first"><em>Traditionally the exclusive domain of men,</em> the Basque gastronomic societies, called <em>txokos,</em> thrive in every corner of the Basque Country, with 15 to 100 members each. As often as once a week, the men spend the evening cooking, drinking, and eating. Professionals and laborers join together in the kitchen to cook, sit side by side to eat, and equally share the costs involved.</p>
<p class="follow">The first such society was reportedly founded in 1870 in San Sebastián. As the concept caught on, other <em>txokos</em> quickly sprang up, in every city and nearly every village in the Basque country. No doubt the clubs originated because men, who were forbidden by custom to cook at home, felt the need of a culinary outlet. Today women are sometimes admitted to the <em>txokos,</em> but only as guests.</p>
<p class="follow">Without question, some of the best food in Spain is prepared at these clubs, but, because they are closed to everyone but their members and members' guests, outsiders rarely have an opportunity to sample the cooking.</p>
