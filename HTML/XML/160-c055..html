<p class="first">This recipe reflects the humble and ancient culinary roots so apparent in the Basque Country. In frugal kitchens, it was considered wasteful to discard even a handful of bread crumbs, and so soups such as this one were developed as a way to use every bit of food in the larder. Many Basque recipes are born of similar circumstances, and I thank my ancestors for their common sense, care, and great sense of flavor and texture. This soup is truly satisfying and comforting, although it is a homely looking brew.</p>

<li>In a clay or other flame-proof casserole or skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic, and fry it, stirring with a wooden spoon, for 2 to 3 minutes, until it is golden. Take care the garlic does not burn.</li>
<li>Add the bread, and turn it several times so that it absorbs the oil. Sprinkle it with the paprika, and toss well. Add the water or broth, and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring, until the soup is heated through and well blended and the bread has absorbed much of the liquid. Season to taste with salt and, if you like, the pepper flakes.</li>
<li>Just before serving the soup, crack the eggs, and slide them onto the surface of the soup, taking care not to break the yolks. Let the eggs cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until the whites are set. Serve the soup by spooning it gently into shallow bowls, allowing one egg per serving.</li>
