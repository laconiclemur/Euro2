<p class="first">Roast suckling pig is much loved in the Basque Country, although this dish is perhaps more associated with Castile. In the United States, it is difficult to find a very small pig; more easy to obtain are 20- to 25-pound pigs, destined for outdoor pig roasts. But a good butcher should be able to obtain a pig small enough to be roasted in the oven, or you can order one from D'Artagnan (800-DARTAGNAN or 973-344-0565). And it's worth the trouble! The little pigs are easy to prepare and so tender that they practically fall apart when cooked, yielding succulent, delicious meat. At home, we serve this dish with nothing more than a simple green salad.</p>

<li>Preheat the oven to 400°F.</li>
<li>Place the pig, belly-side up, in a large roasting pan. Rub the pig with salt and lard or olive oil, and scatter the onion, garlic, and parsley over. Add the water to the pan. Roast the pig for 1 hour.</li>
<li>Turn the pig skin-side up, add the wine, and baste the pig with the pan juices. Raise the heat to 500°F, and roast the pig for about 1 hour longer, until the skin is golden brown and crisp and a thermometer inserted in the thigh registers 160°F.</li>
<li>Cut the pig into pieces. Strain the pan juices, and then heat them gently. Spoon the juices over the pig, and serve.</li>

<blockquote><p class="left"><b>N<span style="font-size: smaller">OTE</span>:</b> <em>Ask the butcher to split the pig's chest as well as the belly. This is a traditional way to dress suckling pig, and he should be able to do it easily (be sure he does not cut the pig's back, though). Or you can cut through the rib cage yourself.</em></p></blockquote>

<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p119"/> Traditional Basque Dances</h4>
<p class="first"><em>In the Basque Country,</em> folk dances are defined according to function and character. At playful social celebrations a large group of men and women will dance in a circle, holding hands or handkerchiefs. In the middle of the circle, the most skilled dancer performs difficult and spectacular steps. The <em>aurresku</em> is the most famous of these circle dances.</p>
<p class="follow">Other dances include the <em>ezpatadantza</em> a "combat dance," in which two rival parties perform bearing swords, sticks, or wooden arches. Also popular are "witch dances," such as the <em>sorgin dantza,</em> usually performed in the village of Lasarte on carnival Sunday. Witch dances date back to ancient times, and their meanings are mostly long lost. But all these folk dances are brought to life at festive occasions by the hundreds of dance groups spread across all parts of the Basque Country.</p>
