<p class="first">For this recipe, you will need boned, skinned chicken breasts. Because the breasts are to be sliced horizontally, not cut in half vertically, be sure they are whole when you buy them. If you cannot buy whole boned breasts, buy bone-in breasts or whole chickens, and cut the meat from the bone yourself. These breasts are seasoned with a typical Basque mixture of parsley, garlic, and olive oil.</p>

<li>Using a sharp boning or slicing knife, cut the chicken breasts in half horizontally to make four pieces, each of them half the thickness of a whole breast. Lightly sprinkle the pieces with salt, and set them aside on a dish.</li>
<li>In a small bowl, mix the garlic, parsley, and 3 tablespoons of the olive oil. Rub the mixture on both sides of the chicken pieces.</li>
<li>In a large skillet, heat about 1½ tablespoons of the olive oil over high heat. Add as many of the chicken pieces as will fit in the pan without crowding, and cook them for about 1 minute. Reduce the heat to medium, and cook the chicken pieces for about 2 minutes. Turn them over, raise the heat to high, and cook them for 1 minute. Reduce the heat to medium again, and cook the chicken for about 2 minutes longer, or until it is cooked through. Remove the chicken from the pan, and keep it warm. Cook the remaining pieces the same way, adding more oil to the pan as needed. Serve the chicken immediately.</li>

<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p130"/> Happy Hens</h4>
<p class="first"><em>I am pleased</em> to see that eggs are regaining their good reputation. The scientific community has rethought its position on the dangers of the cholesterol in egg yolks, so most people no longer need to worry about eating a few eggs a week. When I read an article by Molly O'Neil in the <em>New York Times</em> (September 1997) decreeing that eggs were no longer "in the dog house," my reaction was "Hooray!"</p>
<p class="follow">In the Basque Country, we can still get our eggs from what I call "happy hens"—birds that are able to wander freely around farmyards. In the United States, these are called free-range chickens, which I think is a rather boring name. Whatever you call them, though, happy hens lay delicious eggs, and their meat is superior, too.</p>
<p class="follow">It is common in the Basque Country, as you will see from reading these recipes, to add scrambled or poached eggs to some first courses to convert them into light meals.</p>
