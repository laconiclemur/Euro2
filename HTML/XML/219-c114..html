<p class="first">I nearly always have this easy sauce on hand in the refrigerator at home as well as at the restaurant. Because it is a basic ingredient in so many recipes, it has saved me a number of times when I had to cook something without much warning.</p>
<p class="follow">I highly recommend using a food mill (see <a href="c053.xml#p87">[&gt;]</a>) for this recipe. It produces a sauce with a more authentic, robust consistency and a redder color than does a blender or food processor.</p>
<p class="follow">If the fresh tomatoes at the market are not fully ripe, substitute canned tomatoes.</p>

<li>In a skillet, heat the olive oil over low heat. Add the onion, and cook it, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, for about 10 minutes, or until the onion is softened.</li>
<li>Add the tomatoes, and season to taste with salt and sugar. Stir well, and cook for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally with the wooden spoon.</li>
<li>Pass the sauce through a food mill, or purée it in a blender or food processor. Serve the sauce immediately, or store it in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 6 days.</li>

<blockquote><p class="left"><b>N<span style="font-size: smaller">OTE</span>:</b> <em>If you can't find good ripe tomatoes, substitute about 3¾ cups of drained, peeled (not crushed) canned tomatoes. Canned tomatoes are not as good as seasonal ripe ones, but they are far better than dry, mealy, out-of-season tomatoes.</em></p></blockquote>
