<p class="first">Baby eels are the most delicate dish I have tasted; when they are in season, in the wintertime, I look forward to them with great anticipation. Because they are scarce, their price has risen to spectacular heights. This explains why they are most often served as a Christmas treat, particularly in my home city of Bilbao. In the United States baby eels are sold frozen, and the frozen eels are nearly as good as fresh ones. (Never buy them in cans—canned eels are not good at all!) Traditionally baby eels are cooked as <em>angulas a la cazuela</em> (<a href="c015.xml#p30">[&gt;]</a>), but this salad is becoming popular, too, partly because it requires fewer eels but mostly because it is so tasty.</p>

<li>To prepare the eels, rub the garlic halves around the side and bottom of a salad bowl. Discard the garlic. Add the eels to the bowl, and gently rub them over the bottom and side of the bowl to absorb some of the flavor of the garlic. Add the oil and lemon juice, season to taste with salt, and mix well.</li>
<li>To prepare the salad, whisk together the oil and vinegar in a small bowl, and season the vinaigrette to taste with salt.</li>
<li>In a separate bowl, drizzle the vinaigrette over the lettuce, and toss gently. Spoon the lettuce around the rim of each of four salad plates. Arrange the eels in the center of the plates, garnish with parsley, and serve.</li>

<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p76"/> Baby Eels, A Treasure of the Basque Country</h4>
<p class="first"><em>Today baby eels</em> <em>(angulas)</em> are three times as costly as when I was a girl, but even then they were an expensive pleasure saved for special occasions. In those days they were less expensive, although still dear, in the French Basque country, and from time to time my father crossed the border to buy some in the town of Hendaye. (Since then the French have discovered the joys of baby eels, and now they are just as expensive in France as they are in Spain). I recall one instance when my mother, planning to serve these treasures for lunch, sent me to the local market for some more, so that we could accommodate some unexpected guests. As I walked home with my precious package, I couldn't resist dipping into the sack to nibble an eel or two. When I arrived at home, my mother was dismayed to discover I had devoured more than half of the eels! She sent someone else back to the market for more—and docked my allowance for several weeks.</p>
<p class="follow">When I was first married, before I moved with my husband and children to Madrid, we spent Sundays at my parents' house, where we often had angulas. My very young daughters quickly developed a fondness for the delicacy. After we moved to Madrid, one day my four-year-old daughter, Maria, and I ran into an acquaintance, a courtly gentleman who insisted that we join him for some refreshment before we went home for lunch. I accepted a small glass of wine, and Maria, with wide eyes anticipating her treat, asked for the angulas she spied on the counter of the bar where we were seated. I tried to dissuade our friend from ordering them, saying that Maria had no idea what she was asking for. In fact, I said, she did not even know how angulas taste. "Not so!" exclaimed my daughter. "I have them all the time at my grandmother's." I was embarrassed, but Maria got her eels and devoured them, clearly loving every bite. To this day I do not want to know what the bill was for that spontaneous, kind invitation.</p>
