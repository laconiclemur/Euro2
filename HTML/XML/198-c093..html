<p class="first">This <em>bacalao</em> dish originated in Navarra. Although today Navarra is an autonomous community of Spain, it is part of the greater Basque region called Euskal Herria. This explains why Basque and Navarran cuisines so heavily influence each other. There are numerous recipes for this dish—some have potatoes, and others include lobster and other shellfish—but I find this straightforward preparation the most true to its roots. The salt cod in this dish is shredded, so if you buy a whole <em>bacalada,</em> you can save the attractive center sections for preparations such as Salt Cod Pil Pil (<a href="c091.xml#p151">[&gt;]</a>) or Salt Cod Biscayne-Style (<a href="c092.xml#p153">[&gt;]</a>), and rely on the outer sections of the fish for this. <em>Bacalao Ajoarriero</em> is robust enough to need no accompaniment except bread and wine.</p>

<li>In a shallow bowl, cover the fish with cold water. Refrigerate the fish for 24 to 36 hours, changing the water every 8 hours or so. Drain the fish, and pat it dry.</li>
<li>Lay the cod pieces in a skillet large enough to hold them in a single layer. Add enough olive oil to cover the fish. Bring the fish to a simmer, and cook it for 5 to 10 minutes, until the cod is tender and flaky (do not let the oil get hot enough to boil). Drain the fish, reserving 10 tablespoons of the oil, and let the cod cool.</li>
<li>Return the reserved oil to the skillet, and heat it over medium heat. Add the garlic, and cook it for about 3 minutes, until it is browned. Add the onions and peppers, reduce the heat to low, and sauté for about 15 minutes, until the onions have softened. Add the dried tomatoes or Tomato Sauce, stir well, and season to taste with salt and sugar. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 to 15 minutes longer, until the flavors blend.</li>
<li>While the sauce cooks, remove the skin from the cod, and then carefully lift out any bones. Shred the cod flesh, and add it to the skillet. Stir well, and cook over medium heat for about 10 minutes longer, stirring, until the contents are well mixed and the cod is heated through. A minute or two before serving, add the eggs. Cook, stirring, until the eggs are scrambled and well mixed with the cod and vegetables. Sprinkle with the chopped parsley, and serve immediately.</li>

<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p156"/> Parsley: The Basque Green</h4>
<p class="first"><em>As you have</em> no doubt noticed, I use parsley in many first-course and main-course recipes. So do all Basque cooks. Using parsley—mainly the flat-leaf kind—is a deeply rooted tradition in Basque cuisine. It's the parsley that makes <em>salsa verde verde</em> (green). When my daughter Maria was a small child, she spent a lot of time with my mother while I attended lectures at the university. A great deal of this time was spent in the kitchen, where the little girl "helped" her grandmother cook. She was quite proud of her kitchen skills, and, given the slightest opportunity, listed the ingredients in any dish they had made—always ending with the phrase, "... <em>y un poquito de perejil</em>" (...and a little parsley"). How well she had learned!</p>
