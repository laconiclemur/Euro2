<p class="first">You may be surprised by this dessert. It's a sweet concentration of cooked quince and sugar that is allowed to harden and then is served with fresh cheese or a semicured Manchego for a delightful and very unusual ending to a meal. I learned how to make this from my friend Juanjo Urtasum, a Navarran diplomat currently posted in Brazil. Because he shares my passion for food, we frequently trade recipes, regardless of where we are living. This one is from his 85-year-old aunt, who still makes the dessert, and it has become one of my very favorites.</p>
<p class="follow">For this recipe you will need a scale, since both the quince and sugar must be weighed.</p>

<li>Wash the quinces, but do not peel them. Put them into a large saucepan, and add enough water to cover them by 1 inch. Bring the water to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, and cook the quinces for about 40 minutes, until they begin to crack. With a slotted spoon, remove the quinces from the pan, and set them aside to cool.</li>
<li>When the quinces are cool enough to handle, peel them, and remove and discard the seeds. Weigh the peeled and seeded quinces, and then pass them through a food mill.</li>
<li>Transfer the quinces to a saucepan, and add the same weight of sugar as fruit. Stir well, and cook the mixture over very low heat for about 1 hour, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture turns red and very sticky.</li>
<li>Spoon the jam into a clean cloth napkin, and squeeze out any remaining liquid. Transfer the jam to shallow containers, and let it cool uncovered. Cut it when it has solidified. It will keep in the refrigerator, tightly covered, for up to 2 months.</li>
