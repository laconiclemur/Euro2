<p class="first">As in so many European cuisines, classic mayonnaise is the base for numerous sauces and dressings in the Basque country. Add garlic, herbs, parsley, anchovies, or other seasonings, depending on how the mayonnaise will be served. Note that it is made with raw egg; if this worries you (because of the small risk of salmonella poisoning), use commercial mayonnaise when a recipe calls for <em>mayonesa.</em> I include this recipe because I grew up using it—and to leave it out would seem unnatural to me. For success, be sure the egg is at room temperature.</p>

<li>In a blender, combine the egg with about 1 teaspoon of oil and the salt. Blend at the lowest speed.</li>
<li>With the blender still running, add the remaining olive oil in a slow, steady stream until the oil is incorporated. If you prefer a thicker mayonnaise, blend for an additional 10 seconds at a higher speed.</li>
<li>Transfer the mayonnaise to a bowl, and stir in the vinegar well. Serve immediately, or refrigerate the mayonnaise, covered, for up to 2 days.</li>

<blockquote><p class="left">N<b><span style="font-size: smaller">OTES</span>:</b> <em>It is easiest to make mayonnaise in a small blender jar or with a hand-held blender in a large cup. You can also do it the old-fashioned way, of course, by using a whisk. Add the oil drop by drop at first, then in a very thin stream, as you whisk constantly.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="follow"><em>For milder tasting, whiter mayonnaise, use corn oil in place of olive oil. You can also substitute lemon juice or another type of vinegar for sherry vinegar.</em></p></blockquote>
