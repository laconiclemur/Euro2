<p class="first">My mother made this dish whenever we had an excess of the cream that accumulated at the top of the milk jugs. Today there is no cream at the top of the milk, since milk is homogenized, but I buy heavy cream and make this side dish often. It is similar to American-style mashed potatoes, but it's made with olive oil rather than butter, and it's seasoned with paprika, which colors the potatoes a little. You could halve this recipe, but why bother? Leftovers are great, too.</p>

<li>Put the potatoes into a large saucepan, add enough water to cover them by several inches, and lightly salt it. Bring the water to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and cook the potatoes for about 20 minutes, until they are fork-tender. Drain the potatoes, and pass them through a food mill or mash them with a fork or potato masher. Transfer them to a saucepan.</li>
<li>Add the oil in a slow, steady stream, while stirring the potatoes with a spatula or spoon, until all the oil is incorporated. Add the cream in a slow, steady stream, stirring, until it is incorporated too. Season with the paprika and salt. Heat the potatoes gently, and serve immediately.</li>
