<p class="first">This truly delicious dessert, sometimes called <em>leche frita,</em> in some ways resembles what Americans call French toast. However, similarities end with appearance. The method for making Fried Milk is completely different—for one thing, there is no bread!—and requires far more skill and perseverance. Mostly, you must stand at the stove stirring the milk mixture for at least 20 minutes, until it is creamy and smooth, or the dessert will fail. And then you must be patient and not try to cut the mixture into squares until it is completely cool. If it is even a little warm, it will fall apart when you cut it. <em>Tostadas de crema</em> are very good served with caramel sauce.</p>

<li>In a saucepan, combine 2 cups of the milk with the cinnamon sticks, and bring the milk to a boil over high heat. Immediately reduce the heat to low. Gradually add the sugar, stirring constantly, until it is dissolved. Remove and discard the cinnamon sticks.</li>
<li>In a blender, combine the remaining 1 cup milk and ⅓ cup of the flour, and blend until the mixture is smooth. Transfer it to the saucepan, and cook the mixture over medium-low heat, stirring continuously, until it is creamy and smooth. This will take at least 20 minutes. Pour the mixture into a greased jelly-roll pan of about 8 by 10 inches. (The mixture should fill the pan to a depth of about ½ inch. If it is shallower, use a smaller pan; if it is deeper, use a larger pan.) Let the mixture cool.</li>
<li>When the milk mixture is completely cool, cut it into 2-by-2-inch squares.</li>
<li>In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat until it is very hot. Spread the remaining 2 tablespoons flour in a shallow bowl, and put the eggs into another small bowl. Carefully coat both sides of each square with flour, and then dip it in the eggs. Fry the squares in the hot oil, immediately reducing the heat a little as soon as you put the squares into the hot oil. Fry them for 1 minute on each side, and then drain them on paper towels. You will have to do this in batches; reheat the oil between batches.</li>
<li>Serve the squares warm or at room temperature, sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon.</li>
