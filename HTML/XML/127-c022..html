<p class="first">Crayfish, often referred to as crawfish or crawdads, are small, freshwater crustaceans that are especially sweet and succulent. They are greatly enjoyed throughout the Basque Country and France as well as by Cajuns and Creoles. Crayfish resemble tiny lobsters, and like lobsters they turn bright red when cooked. Also as with lobsters, it is best to cook crayfish live just before eating them; they taste freshest and sweetest this way. The cooking method here, however, will not appeal to everyone, so I urge sensitive cooks to read the recipe before deciding whether to make the dish. If you do make it, you will be rewarded with a delicious—if slightly messy—first course.</p>
<p class="follow">You will want to pick up the cooked crayfish with your fingers and extract the meat with a small pick or tiny fork.</p>

<li>Put the crayfish into a large colander, and rinse them under cool running water. Take care that their small claws don't pinch your fingers. Lift a crayfish from the colander, grasping it in the center of its body. At the end of the tail are three flippers. Grab the middle flipper, and, while twisting it, pull on it to remove it and the attached intestine. Discard the flipper and intestine, and put the crayfish into a large skillet. Put the lid on the skillet to keep the crayfish contained. Repeat with the remaining crayfish.</li>
<li>Add the wine to the skillet, cover the skillet, and bring the wine to a boil over high heat. Boil the crayfish for 5 minutes, adjusting the heat to prevent boilovers. When the crayfish turn bright red, drain them in a colander, and rinse them under cool running water. Rinse them well, since they will have exuded some grit while boiling. Return the crayfish to the skillet.</li>
<li>Add the sauce to the skillet, and heat it over medium-high heat. Season it to taste with hot pepper flakes. Cook for about 10 minutes, until the sauce is hot and the flavors are blended. Serve the crayfish and sauce in shallow bowls.</li>
