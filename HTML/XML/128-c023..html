<p class="first">When I was a child, our family spent the summers near the beach in Mundaka, a small coastal village. The closest beach was called Laidatxu (the suffix <em>-txu</em> is a Basque diminutive; in Spanish the same suffix is <em>-chu).</em> Although we loved piling into the boat with my father for the trip across the channel to the larger beach, called Laida, we always had a good time on Laidatxu, too. My younger brothers, Angel and Iñigo, were particularly proud of the clams they dug on this beach, as they tried to emulate the more impressive catches brought home by my older brothers, who ventured farther from home to fish. My mother made this clam dish to honor the little boys, and it became a family favorite.</p>
<p class="follow">Because I prefer this dish a little soupy, I add an extra ½ cup hot water about 5 minutes before the end of cooking. Leave this out if you like your rice drier.</p>

<li>Put the clams into a bowl or pot, and cover them with lightly salted cold water. Using your hands, swish the clams through the water, and then let them sit in water for about 30 minutes. Drain them, and rinse them well.</li>
<li>In a large saucepan, combine the clams and the 3 cups water, and bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook the clams for about 5 minutes, stirring them with a wooden spoon until they open. Drain them, reserving the cooking liquid. Discard any clams that have not opened. Add enough water to the reserved cooking liquid to total 3 cups.</li>
<li>In a pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat, and cook the garlic for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring, until it is softened. Before the garlic begins to brown, add the rice, and stir to mix it with the garlic and oil.</li>
<li>Add the reserved cooking liquid and water, and bring the contents to a boil. Add the clams and parsley, and season to taste with salt. Reduce the heat, cover the pan, and simmer for about 20 minutes or until the rice is cooked and most of the liquid is absorbed. If you like a soupy consistency, add ½ cup hot water to the pot about 5 minutes before the end of cooking. Let the pan stand off the heat, covered, for about 10 minutes so the flavors blend. Serve in shallow bowls.</li>

<blockquote><p class="left"><b>N<span style="font-size: smaller">OTES</span>:</b> <em>During the last few minutes of the standing time, you might place the saucepan in a large container of cold water to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Do not let the pan sit in cold water for very long, though, or the rice will cool.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="follow"><em>You may have to order Manila clams from a reputable fishmonger. If they are not available, substitute littleneck or slightly larger cherrystone clams. Cockles are a good substitute, too, although they may be hard to find.</em></p></blockquote>

<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p45"/> Gooseneck Barnacles</h4>
<p class="first"><em>Arguably the most exotic</em> product of the sea, these barnacles may not look appealing, but their flavor is simply sublime. Europeans have been eating <em>percebes,</em> or gooseneck barnacles, for centuries; the Latin word for them is <em>pollicipedes.</em> In 1652, when the great painter Diego de Velazquez spent time in the Basque Country, he became enamored of the small sea creatures. On a commission from the king of Spain to paint a picture of Infanta Maria Teresa's wedding to Luis XIV, the king of France, Velazquez spent several months in the region, during which he reportedly feasted on the barnacles whenever possible. He raved about them when he returned to Madrid, and epicures have been singing their praises ever since.</p>
<p class="follow">The tube-shaped barnacles grow in clusters on rocks in deep waters, which makes them difficult to harvest, since the rocks are often bashed by large, rough waves, even at low tide. For this reason the barnacles are usually reserved for special occasions at home, and served in mainly the finer restaurants in the Basque Country. They are nearly impossible to buy in the United States, although they grow in Alaska, but because they are so much a part of our cuisine, I wanted to write about them. Even if you never cook them, I hope you will try them in a restaurant if you visit the Basque Country.</p>
<p class="follow">If you can acquire some gooseneck barnacles, boil them in salted water for only about 3 minutes, and then remove the pot from the heat. Let the barnacles stand, covered, for about 10 minutes. Drain them, and serve them as plain as can be. Gooseneck barnacles are best eaten just by themselves, without sauce or other adornment.</p>
