<p class="first">I first tasted this savory terrine at the home of the Bornecheas, a large family with impeccable culinary traditions whom I have known for years. Since the Bornecheas always serve wonderful food, it is a joy to visit them. Here leeks, a popular vegetable in the Basque Country, are combined with shrimp for a modern and elegant main-course dish. It is perfect for warm-weather entertaining, because it can be made well ahead of time and then served at room temperature. Note that this recipe calls for butter, which is rarely used in traditional Basque cooking.</p>

<li>Preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly butter an 8-by-5-inch loaf mold.</li>
<li>In a small pot, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the leeks, and cook them for 3 to 4 minutes, until they are golden. Add the wine, and cook over medium-low heat for about 15 minutes, until the leeks are tender and the wine is nearly evaporated.</li>
<li>Transfer the leeks to a blender or a food processor fitted with a metal blade, add ½ cup of the milk, and purée the mixture. Return it to the pan.</li>
<li>In a small bowl, stir the cornstarch into the remaining ½ cup milk.</li>
<li>Add the shrimp and the cornstarch mixture to the pan, and bring the contents to a boil over high heat. Immediately reduce the heat to medium-low, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, for about 5 minutes, until the mixture is thickened.</li>
<li>Put the eggs into a heat-proof bowl, and stir the shrimp-vegetable mixture into them, a little at a time to prevent the eggs from cooking. When it is well combined, scrape the mixture into the mold, and cover the mold with aluminum foil. Set the mold in a larger pan, and add enough hot water to come about a third of the way up the side of the mold. Bake the terrine for about 1 hour, until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Place the mold on a wire rack. Before the terrine cools completely, loosen it by running a knife around the outside of the mold. Let the terrine finish cooling.</li>
<li>When the terrine is completely cool, place a flat plate over the mold, and invert the terrine to unmold it. Slice it, and serve the slices at room temperature on lettuce leaves with mayonnaise on the side.</li>
