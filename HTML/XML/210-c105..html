<p class="first">If you're visiting the Basque Country during the summer, you most likely will be served albacore tuna, which we call <em>bonito.</em> It is far smaller than other tuna, and its breast is especially juicy and tasty. In the United States, this choice part is often called the belly rather than the breast, but regardless of the moniker it is hard to find (most albacore breast is sold to the Japanese for sashimi and sushi). This dish is very good with other tuna, too, although they are red-fleshed rather than white, as is albacore. I like to serve this with Vegetable Stew (<a href="c026.xml#p51">[&gt;]</a>) or other vegetables.</p>

<li>Preheat the oven to 500°F. Rub a baking pan with the olive oil.</li>
<li>Lightly sprinkle the skinless surfaces of the tuna with salt, and rub them with garlic. Lay the tuna pieces in the baking pan, skin-side down, and bake them for about 15 minutes without turning them. Serve them immediately. (Do not eat the skin; it is tough.)</li>
