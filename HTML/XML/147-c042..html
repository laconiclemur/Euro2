<p class="first">Whenever I make this salad, I think of a friend of my parents who tended a large vegetable garden near our summer house at the seashore. When my father caught more squid than we could use, he sent us children into the neighborhood to give them to friends. The gardening enthusiast I remember gave us red and green bell peppers in return, and my mother often made a salad similar to this pretty one.</p>

<li>Tear the roasted peppers in half.</li>
<li>On each plate, lay a red pepper half and, next to it, a green pepper half. Top each with a few anchovies, and then lay a pepper half of the opposite color on top. Lay several anchovies on top of the pepper. Repeat this on the other three plates. Spoon a little dressing over the peppers, and serve.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p class="left"><b>N<span style="font-size: smaller">OTES</span>:</b> <em>If you can get fresh anchovies marinated in a vinegar brine, use them in place of canned anchovies. Or, if you prefer, substitute dry-cured ham such as serrano or prosciutto for the anchovies.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="follow"><em>You can, of course, make these stacks of peppers and anchovies higher than two layers by using more peppers or cutting them into smaller pieces.</em></p></blockquote>

<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p70"/> Roasting Peppers</h4>
<p class="first"><em>I roast peppers</em> at least once a week at home and daily in the restaurant. Once they are roasted, I store them in a covered container in the refrigerator, where they keep for up to a week. They are the perfect accompaniment for so many foods, including filet mignon, pork chops, pan-fried fish, and even scrambled or fried eggs. The aroma that fills the house when the peppers are roasting is worth the small effort it takes to roast them!</p>
<p class="follow">Although I usually roast red bell peppers, you can use this same method to roast other kinds. Begin by wiping the peppers clean with a damp cloth rather than rinsing them under running water; this prevents them from absorbing moisture. Lay them on a baking sheet set on the center rack of the oven, and roast them at 350 degrees for about 1 hour. To keep them from burning, turn them every 15 minutes while they roast, taking care to handle them carefully.</p>
<p class="follow">When the peppers are darkened and tender, remove the pan from the oven, and cover the peppers with paper or dish towels (I like to use newspaper). Let the peppers cool until they are tepid, and then peel off the skins. Tear or cut the peppers in half, scrape out the seeds, and collect the juice. Strain the juice, and reserve it. Cut each pepper into strips about ⅓ inch wide or whatever size the recipe calls for.</p>
<p class="follow">Although the peppers are ready to use at this point, I prefer to take the extra step of cooking them in olive oil with sliced garlic, salt, and sugar, as we do in the Basque Country. This makes them taste indescribably wonderful. To cook them this way, heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic, and cook it for 2 to 3 minutes, until it turns golden. Add the peppers, salt and sugar to taste, and the reserved pepper juice. Reduce the heat, and cook the peppers very slowly, stirring often, for about 15 minutes. For eight red bell peppers, I use ½ cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil and one garlic clove. You need only a sprinkling of salt and sugar to bring out the flavor of the peppers.</p>
