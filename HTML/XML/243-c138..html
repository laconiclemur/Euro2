<p class="first">People have always appreciated the fig, a tree as primordial as it looks; archeologists have discovered traces of the tree's leaves and fruit among European prehistoric remains. Once you taste a fig, you understand why the small, not-too-sweet fruit has been so cherished that today a basket of figs still symbolizes friendship, prosperity, and good luck. (The notable exception to this is the basket of figs given Cleopatra; a deadly asp was coiled beneath the fruit!) Although to my knowledge there is only one word for "fig" in English, in Spanish we have two words. <em>Brebas</em> refers to purple figs, and <em>higos</em> to green ones. Both have very short seasons—<em>brebas</em> in July and <em>higos</em> in August—which explains the Spanish expression "<em>de higos a brebas,</em>" which roughly translates as "August till July" and means the same as the expression "once in a blue moon." For a brief time in midsummer, however, the seasons overlap, and you can get both kinds of figs. I always take advantage of this short interlude to serve two together in this simple way.</p>
