<p class="first">I call this fish "lightly puffed" because of the way I make the egg batter. First, I beat the egg whites until they are very foamy, and then I gently whisk the egg yolks into the whites before dipping the floured fish into the eggs. This results in a light, puffed coating on the cooked fish. Throughout the Basque Country, you will find all types of filleted fish pan-fried this way. The fish is great with a green salad and Basque Fries (<a href="c123.xml#p198">[&gt;]</a>).</p>

<li>Flatten the fillets with your palm to an even ¾-inch thickness, taking special care with the thicker ends.</li>
<li>Spread the flour in a shallow dish. Season the hake with salt, and dredge it with flour. Shake off the excess flour, and set the hake aside.</li>
<li>Using a wire whisk or a fork, beat the whites in a bowl to the "snow point"—until they are very foamy, just before they start to thicken to soft peaks. Lightly whisk the yolks, and then stir them into the beaten whites until the mixture is smooth.</li>
<li>In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Dip the fillet pieces into
the egg, and then drop them into the pan. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and fry the fish for about 2 minutes. Raise the heat back to medium-high. After about 30 seconds, turn the fillets. Reduce the heat to medium-low again, and fry the fish 2 minutes more. Using a slotted spoon or tongs, remove the fish, and drain it on two layers of paper towels. Serve at once.</li>

<blockquote><p class="left"><b>N<span style="font-size: smaller">OTE</span>:</b> <em>Fresh cod tastes similar to hake, a distant cousin that swims in nearby water but is less plentiful and more expensive. When battered, both fishes look alike, which prompts the saying,</em> "Que te conozco bacalao, aunque vengas albar-dao." "<em>Cod, I recognize you, even if you come battered." We say this when someone tries to pass off a less valuable item for a more valuable one.</em></p></blockquote>

<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p146"/> The Noble Hake</h4>
<p class="first"><em>Although we Basques</em> prepare hake just as we do scrod, hake has, I think, a subtler flavor and more delicate texture. It is also more expensive. The two fishes look similar, so you have to be diligent when ordering hake in a restaurant; be sure you are not served scrod instead. Once you have tried both, you will know the difference by taste.</p>
<p class="follow">One of the best places to eat hake in the Basque Country is Kirol, a tiny restaurant in Bilbao where the fish is cooked to perfection. When I go home, I never miss an opportunity to occupy one of Kirol's five tables.</p>
<p class="follow">At Kirol and elsewhere in the Basque Country, hake is frequently cooked in our simple green sauce (<em>salsa verde).</em> The sauce never obscures the flavor of the fish. Basque cooks relish the flavors and textures of all our sauces, but most of all, we appreciate the intrinsic flavors of the foods we're saucing.</p>
