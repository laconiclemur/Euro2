<p class="first">Piquillo peppers are a delicacy that we in the Basque Country indulge in whenever we can. The peppers are grown in neighboring Navarra, where the climate and soil are favorable for their cultivation. They are hand-picked, roasted in brick ovens, peeled by hand, and then packed in glass jars or cans. Look for them in specialty-foods stores. In this recipe, they are stuffed with salt cod for a typical Basque taste treat, and served with Biscayne sauce, which is made with sweet, dry choricero peppers. You can serve Spanish Sauce (<a href="c113.xml#p185">[&gt;]</a>) in place of Biscayne Sauce, if you prefer. The salt cod must be soaked for 24 to 36 hours to reduce the saltiness, so allow yourself plenty of time.</p>

<li>In a shallow bowl, cover the fish with cold water. Refrigerate the fish for 24 to 36 hours, changing the water every 8 hours or so. Drain the fish on paper towels, and shred it with your fingers.</li>
<li>In a skillet or sauté pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the fish, and sauté it for about 5 minutes, until it is lightly browned. Add the flour, and mix well. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, adding the milk a little at a time and stirring until the cod béchamel is smooth. Set the pan aside, and let the béchamel cool.</li>

<li>Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
<li>Using a teaspoon, stuff the peppers with the béchamel. Arrange the peppers in a casserole just large enough to hold them snugly. Spoon the Biscayne Sauce over the peppers, and bake them, uncovered, for about 5 to 10 minutes, or until they are heated through and the sauce is bubbling. Serve immediately</li>

<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p149"/> Salt Cod</h4>
<p class="first"><em>In the Basque</em> Country, the word <em>bacalao</em> refers to salted, dried cod; when we mean fresh cod, we say, "<em>bacalao fresco.</em>" This shows in what high regard we hold the salted product, which is as delicious as it is dear to the hearts of my countrymen and -women.</p>
<p class="follow">Basques are widely admired for their ways with cod, both on the sea and in the kitchen. We have been fishing for cod for centuries. According to Mark Kurlansky, author of <em>Cod: A Biography of the Fish that Changed the World,</em> Basque fishermen fished the fertile cod grounds off the Atlantic coast of North America long before Columbus sailed to the New World. Few people have known about this practice because, frankly, the Basque fishermen wanted to keep the location of these fishing grounds to themselves. Because cod fishermen sailed so far from home in search of the fish, they cured much of it with salt to preserve it during the return journey. The Basques' long reliance on salted, dried cod may partly explain why we are partial to this boldly flavored dried fish despite having plenty of fresh fish in the Basque Country.</p>
<p class="follow">In the United States, salt cod is imported primarily from Canada and Norway. Canadian salt cod is cured for 30 days, Norwegian salt cod for 60 days. Both are very good, but I prefer the Norwegian—it is a little stronger and more like the bacalao I ate when I was growing up. Salt cod is relatively easy to find in American fish stores, grocery stores, and supermarkets, particularly in regions with sizable Italian and Portuguese populations.</p>
<p class="follow"><a id="p150"/> You can buy salt cod as a whole fish, or <em>bacalada</em>; in a smaller piece, with the skin and bones; or with the skin and bones removed. Regardless of the type, salt cod must be soaked to reduce its extreme saltiness. This is easily accomplished by covering the fish with cold water and then refrigerating it for 24 to 36 hours. Change the water three or four times, or about every 8 hours. Depending on the curing method, the fish may be mild enough to eat after 24 hours, or it may require the full 36 hours. Taste the fish after 24 hours; if its flavor is appealing, drain it and proceed with the recipe. The soaked fish will be thicker because of the water it has absorbed, and it will be far more flexible than the stiff, board-like specimen with which you began. To me, the transformation always seems like a small miracle!</p>
