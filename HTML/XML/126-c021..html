<p class="first">Manila clams, increasingly available in the United States, are much like the clams I ate when growing up in Bilbao. Small and sweet, they are ideal for this dish.</p>
<p class="follow">I have always made this dish in an earthenware casserole, for several reasons: These casseroles hold heat beautifully and promote even cooking; they are attractive enough to bring to the table for serving; and, finally, I was taught to cook using them and so fully appreciate their value. However, you can use another shallow casserole. Be sure it is flame-proof.</p>

<li>Put the clams into a large bowl or pot, and cover them with lightly salted cold water. Using your hands, swish the clams through the water, and then let them sit in the water for about 30 minutes. Drain them, and rinse them well.</li>
<li>In a large saucepan, combine the clams and the 3 cups water, and bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook the clams for about 5 minutes, stirring them with a wooden spoon until they open. Drain the clams, reserving the cooking liquid. Discard any clams that have not opened.</li>
<li>Pour the olive oil into a shallow flame-proof casserole, and heat it over very low heat to prevent the casserole from cracking. Add the garlic, and cook it, stirring, for about 2 minutes, until it begins to turn golden. Sprinkle the flour over the garlic, and stir with a wooden spoon until the flour is well mixed with the oil and garlic. Add 2 cups of the reserved cooking liquid, the salt, and the parsley, bring the mixture to a boil, stirring occasionally, and cook for about 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Add the wine and clams, and gently shake the casserole to distribute the ingredients evenly and to coat the clams with the sauce. Add a tablespoon or so more of the reserved cooking liquid, if necessary, to maintain a sauce-like consistency. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes longer, until the sauce thickens slightly and the dish is heated through. Serve the clams and sauce immediately, spooned into shallow soup bowls.</li>

<blockquote><p class="left"><b>N<span style="font-size: smaller">OTE</span>:</b> <em>A reputable fishmonger should be able to supply you with Manila clams, although you may have to call ahead to order them. If they are not available, substitute littleneck or slightly larger cherrystone clams. Cockles are a good substitute, too, although they may be hard to find.</em></p></blockquote>

<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p41"/> Earthenware Casseroles</h4>
<p class="first"><em>Flame-proof clay casseroles</em> are very common in Spain. I like to use them because they keep cooked food warm and, since they are decorative, they can double as serving dishes. They come in sizes ranging from 5 inches (recommended for individual portions of sizzling garlic shrimp or baby eels) to 12 inches or wider. The depth varies depending on the size; the small ones are 1 inch deep, the bigger ones as deep as 3 inches.</p>
<p class="follow">In the United States, flame-proof earthenware casseroles are available in many kitchenware stores and some large specialty-foods stores. If you can't find them locally, you can order them from Northern Boulevard (718-779-4971).</p>
<p class="follow">Even if the label says it is flame-proof, a clay casserole must be treated to prevent cracking before it is used over direct heat. Put your new casserole into a large kettle, cover it with cold water, and leave it overnight. The next day, boil the casserole for 30 minutes, making sure that it is always covered by water.</p>
<p class="follow">When you first use your earthenware casserole over direct heat, place a flame tamer (an iron disk) under the casserole to keep it from cracking. Later you may find this isn't necessary.</p>
