<p class="first">In this recipe you can use any large crabs, such as stone crabs. But if you ever come across a spider crab, buy it. Do not let its name or appearance discourage you; it is the most splendid crab, one we cherish in the Basque Country and pay dearly for. Spider crabs are imported to the United States, but, perhaps because they look like giant spiders, most fishmongers do not market them. This recipe, developed at the turn of the century by Shishito Ibarguren, a legendary chef from San Sebastián (Donostia, in Euskera), is the classic one for spider crabs. If you order spider crabs in a restaurant in the Basque Country, most likely they will be prepared precisely in this way. Ibarguren is known also for opening a cooking school for women, where many of the best domestic cooks of the day trained before going to work for affluent families.</p>

<li><a id="p47"/> To cook the crabs, combine in a large stockpot enough water to cover the crabs (2 to 3 quarts, depending on the size of the pot) and 2 tablespoons salt for every quart of water. Bring the water to a boil over high heat. Add the leeks, parsley, and onion, and return the water to a boil. Add the crabs, cover the pot tightly, and bring the water to a boil again. Boil the crabs for 12 minutes, until they turn red. Remove the pot from the heat, and let the water cool to lukewarm.</li>
<li>To prepare the sauce, heat the oil and butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. When the butter melts, add the onions, carrots, and garlic, and sauté the vegetables for about 15 minutes, until they soften. Stir in the Tomato Sauce.</li>
<li>Holding a crab over a bowl, pull off the top shell, and then remove the crabmeat from the body and legs, allowing the liquid to collect in the bowl. Clean the empty top shell under running water, and set it aside to drain. Do the same with the other crabs.</li>
<li>Add the crabmeat, accumulated liquid, brandy or cognac, and sherry to the pan. Bring the contents to a simmer over medium heat, and cook them gently for about 10 minutes, until the flavors blend.</li>
<li>Preheat the broiler.</li>
<li>Spoon the crabmeat mixture into the top shells, and arrange the filled shells on a broiling rack. Sprinkle with parsley, bread crumbs, and bits of butter, and broil until the butter melts and the crumbs brown. Serve hot.</li>

<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p48"/> Spanish Sherry and Montilla Wines</h4>
<p class="first"><em>Sherry is traditionally</em> made in Andalucía, the large region that runs along Spain's South Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts. Here, the town of Jerez de la Frontera has long been famed for its production of <em>jerez</em>—or <em>sherry,</em> as the English mispronounced the word—the golden wine named for the town. The best known categories of sherry are <em>fino</em> and <em>manzanilla,</em> both pale, straw-gold wines, fresh tasting and impeccably dry. Always served chilled, they are the ideal accompaniment for pinchos or tapas. Cream sherries, very popular in northern Europe and North America, are smooth and rich with a warm aftertaste, and as such make excellent dessert wines. These should always be served at room temperature.</p>
<p class="follow">Whereas locals are often seen ordering sherry in Andalusian bars and taverns, this is not a particularly common sight in the Basque Country. We Basques appreciate good sherry now and then, but as a rule we prefer red Rioja wines.</p>
<p class="follow">We cook with sherry, however, and when we do so, we follow the golden rule of cooking: The better the ingredients, the better will be the finished dish. This means using respectable sherry when a recipe calls for it, rather than relying on cheap "cooking sherry." Because I rarely call for much sherry in a recipe, and because the wine keeps quite well once it is opened, this rule should be easy for you to follow.</p>
<p class="follow">Montilla, in the province of Córdoba, is another region that produces very fine wines. Outside of Spain, Montilla is less known than Jerez, but its <em>finos,</em> round <em>amontillados,</em> full-bodied <em>olorosos,</em> and sweet Pedro Ximénez wines deserve a close look. All of these are available in the United States. I am particularly fond of Fino Alvear, from one of the oldest wineries of Spain, founded in 1729. Serve this wine chilled with the pincho or tapa of your preference.</p>
