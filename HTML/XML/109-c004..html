<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p16"/> Cooking Shrimp Basque-Style</h4>
<p class="first"><em>We Basques eat</em> a lot of shrimp. We buy them as fresh as possible, still in their shells and smelling pleasantly briny. I recommend buying the shrimp on the day you will serve them and cooking them no more than an hour or so before serving.</p>
<p class="follow">As soon as you get home with the shrimp, store them in the rear of the refrigerator, where it is coolest. If they will be stored for more than a few hours, set the wrapped package in a small bowl, and place the small bowl in a larger one filled with ice. Refrigerate the shrimp sitting on ice to keep them as cold as possible without freezing.</p>
<p class="follow">To cook the shrimp, fill a pot about three-quarters full with water (for a pound of shrimp you will need about 4 cups water). Add 1 teaspoon coarse salt, three black peppercorns, and one bay leaf for every pound of shrimp, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Add the shrimp, still in their shells. As soon as the water returns to a boil, remove the shrimp with a slotted spoon or mesh skimmer, or drain them in a colander. Without delay, transfer the shrimp to a large bowl filled with ice cubes, ice water, or both, so that the shrimp cool as quickly as possible. Peel the shrimp, which now will be pink, and use them immediately or refrigerate them.</p>
