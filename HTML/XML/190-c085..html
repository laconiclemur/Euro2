<p class="first">Pheasant is a full-flavored bird that is most often considered to be wild game. However, many butchers and specialty markets sell farm-raised birds, particularly in the fall of the year, as does D'Artagnan, a New Jersey company that ships specialty meats all over the United States (call 800-DARTAGNAN or 973-344-0565). My brothers were avid hunters, so when I was growing up we often had fresh pheasant, and I am extremely fond of it. But even if you know no hunters, I hope you will try this lovely dish.</p>

<li><a id="p138"/> Lightly sprinkle the pheasants inside and out with salt and pepper. Rub the outside of each pheasant with about 1 tablespoon lard or olive oil, and lay two slices of bacon over each pheasant. Truss the pheasants with kitchen twine, tying the legs, wings, and bacon against each body.</li>
<li>In a large pot, heat the remaining lard or olive oil over high heat. Add the pheasants, and cook them for about 15 minutes, turning them several times, until they are golden on all sides.</li>
<li>Reduce the heat to medium. Add the onions, carrots, and herbs, cover the pot, and cook for about 15 minutes, until the onions soften.</li>
<li>Raise the heat to high. Add the broth and white wine, and bring them to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, and cook the pheasants, covered, for about 45 minutes, until the juices run clear when the thighs are pierced with a small sharp knife or fork.</li>
<li>Remove the herbs from the pot. Remove the birds, cut the twine, and carve the pheasants. Transfer the remaining contents of the pot to a food processor or blender, and purée them. For a thicker sauce, transfer the blended sauce to a saucepan. Whisk together the butter and flour, and add the mixture to the pan. Whisking constantly, bring the sauce to a boil, and cook it for about 5 minutes, until it is thick. Spoon the sauce over the pheasants, and serve them.</li>

<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p139"/> Food and Wines of the Basque Country</h4>
<p class="first"><em>Spain is the third</em> largest wine-producing country in the world; only France and Italy exceed Spain's output. Spanish wines are primarily identified by their growing regions, known as <em>denominaciones de origen</em> (D.O.). There are more than fifty such denominations, some of the best-known being Rioja, Ribera del Duero, Rias Baixas, and Penedes. Rioja, the most widely recognized denomination, was also the first to be officially designated.</p>
<p class="follow">The Rioja region is situated to the southwest of the Pyrenees. The Sierra de Cantabria mountains are to the north and west of Rioja, and the Sierra de la Demanda to the south. Named after the Rio Oja, a tributary of the Ebro River, Rioja is divided into three areas: Rioja Alta in the western highlands, Rioja Baja in the lower plains to the south and east, and Rioja Alavesa to the northwest, in the Basque province of Alava. Rioja Alavesa, a stunningly scenic area, is home to such historic wine-making towns and villages as Elciego, Oyon, Laguardia, and Samaniego, each worth a day's visit.</p>
<p class="follow">Rioja wines, particularly those from Rioja Alta and Rioja Alavesa, are the most commonly consumed in the Basque Country. Generally, Basques prefer red wines to white, and they appreciate the beautifully transparent, ruby color of Rioja reds. As a rule, these wines are lighter than the deeper, more full-bodied reds from France, Italy, and California. Their characteristic transparency is a result of their high proportion of <em>tempranillo</em> grapes <em>(temprano</em> means "early," and the grape is so named because it ripens from mid-September to early October, a full two weeks before other Rioja grapes). These unique characteristics make Rioja wines a perfect match for nearly any meat, fish, or poultry dish. Lightness and transparency, however, do not diminish the complexity of our <em>reservas</em> and <em>gran reservas.</em></p>
<p class="timebreak"> <br/></p>
<p class="left"><b>White Wines:</b> Basques may drink far more red wine than white, but we appreciate white wines, especially in the heat of summer and with certain seafood dishes. Our most distinctive white wine is made not in Rioja but in our own coastal provinces. From the white wine grapes that grow on our rugged coast, nearly to the edge of the sea, we make <em>txakolí,</em> considered almost a national drink. Light, clean-tasting, and pleasantly acidic, txakolí wines are usually unfiltered and sometimes <em>petillant—</em> slightly sparkling, but not so effervescent that they can be labeled sparkling wine. These characteristics make them perfect matches with crustaceans and other fresh seafood. Txakolí are nice summer wines, and their low alcohol content (10.5 to 11 percent) make them good with lunch or as aperitifs.</p>
<p class="follow"><a id="p140"/> In the Basque Country, there are dozens of txakolí labels. The best known txakolí D.O., though, is Getaria, a town about 40 miles to the west of San Sebastián with no more than 85 hectares of vineyards, which makes it the smallest D.O. in Spain. Because of such limited production, these wines are consumed almost exclusively in the Basque Country, although a few find their way to other parts of Europe. Txomin Etxaniz is a txakolí that is exported to the United States through Fine Estates of Spain, a company in Dedham, Massachusetts. Because txakolí are artisanal rather than mass-produced wines, they are rather expensive.</p>
<p class="timebreak"> <br/></p>
<p class="left"><b>Red Wines:</b> Red wine is the favorite accompaniment for most Basque meals. We also drink it with <em>pinchos</em> (snacks), or by itself as a <em>chiquito,</em> or "little one"—a 3- to 4-ounce serving of wine that costs less than a dollar at most bars.</p>
<p class="follow">There are four categories of red wine; these are determined by the aging process, which is reflected in the quality and price level. The age of a Spanish wine is clearly noted on the small, numbered label on the back of every bottle, which declares the wine's denomination of origin and its category as (1) <em>sin crianza,</em> (2) <em>crianza,</em> (3) <em>reserva,</em> or (4) <em>gran reserva.</em></p>
<p class="follow">Traditionally, <em>bodegas</em> (wineries) aged their wines for many years in 225-liter <em>barricas</em> (barrels) of American or French oak, but recently there has been a trend to age wines in both oak and the bottle to help them reach their full potential. The <em>sin crianza</em> or <em>vino joven</em> (young wine) is not aged in oak; it is comparable to the French <em>Beaujolais.</em> Wines labeled <em>crianza,</em> which means "aged in oak," require at least two years' aging, of which a minimum of one year must be in oak and the remainder in the bottle. <em>Reserva</em> wines are required to be aged in oak for a minimum of one year, followed by two years in the bottle. <em>Gran reservas</em> require at least two years in oak casks and no fewer than three years in the bottle. These official regulations do not restrict the individual <em>bodeguero</em> (wine maker) from choosing to age his wines longer.</p>
<p class="follow"><a id="p141"/> Aging is usually done only in good and very good years for reservas and in very good to excellent years for gran reservas. Red wines are aged for longer periods than whites, although some whites, such as Rioja wines made with local viura grapes, are traditionally aged in oak barrels, too.</p>
<p class="follow">I have some favorite red wines from Rioja Alavesa, Rioja Alta, and even from the D.O. of Navarra, which produces exquisite wines quite similar in style to those of Rioja. All these wines are now available in the United States, and whenever I see them I feel as if I am at home in Spain. Although the vintages are recent, I recognize many of the labels from my youth and my parents' house.</p>
<p class="follow">I highly recommend Vina Tondonia, made by R. Lopez de Heredia, one of Rioja's oldest wineries, established in 1877. My dear American friend Gerry Dawes, who is an enthusiastic expert in Spanish wine and gastronomy, rates Viña Tondonia Reserva 1990 with 92 points (out of 100), describing it as "complex, full, mature, with a lively, firm, oaky finish." Viña Tondonia is imported to the United States by Think Global in Santa Barbara, California.</p>
<p class="follow">Another favorite from Rioja Alta is Bodegas Muga, a wine that ranks among the best that Rioja has to offer in terms of tradition and quality. Muga has beautiful <em>crianzas, reservas,</em> and <em>gran reservas,</em> the last bearing the name Prado Enea. This winery also offers a new high-end label called Torremuga; the <em>reserva</em> 1991 earned 95 points from Dawes. Muga is available in the United States through Fine Estates from Spain.</p>

<p class="follow"><a id="p142"/> One of Rioja Alavesa's finest wineries is Granja Nuestra Señora de Remelluri. The owner's son Telmo Rodriguez, whom I know well, spent some time in nearby France, which may explain why his wines resemble French wines in style, and why his <em>bodega</em> is among very few in Rioja simply to state the harvest year on the label, and not the category (<em>crianza</em>, <em>reserva,</em> or <em>gran reserva).</em> Remelluri wines are also available through Fine Estates from Spain.</p>
<p class="follow">Another favorite of mine is a wine from Navarra, Gran Feudo, made by Bodegas Julian Chivite and available through CIV, U.S.A. in Sacramento, California. This beautifully soft wine is made of <em>tempranillo</em> grapes blended with small amounts of cabernet and merlot. During a recent tasting in Navarra, my friend Gerry Dawes gave the "Coleccion 125 Aniversario" a rating of 94 points.</p>
<p class="follow">Chivite also makes a magnificent <em>rosado</em> (rosé) that ranks among the world's best. I have found that drinking <em>rosado</em> can become a delightful habit, particularly in the summer when a glass of chilled <em>rosado</em> makes a perfect cocktail or meal accompaniment. And I love the pretty color.</p>
<p class="follow">There are so many more wonderful wines from Rioja and surrounding regions that I cannot mention them all. I hope you will enjoy trying them to discover your own favorites.</p>
