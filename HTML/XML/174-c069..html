<p class="first">When I was a child, we spent the summers at the shore in a town called Mundaka. Every morning, a nearby dairy farm delivered jugs of fresh milk to us; my mouth still waters when I remember the lovely, thick cream that rose to the top. Because the milk was delivered daily, my mother sometimes had an excess, and since she believed strongly in using every last drop or crumb of edible food, she frequently cooked this pork dish. Although we children called it "not-again pork," today I love this dish and highly recommend it. The pork cooked in milk is lovely and tender, and the pan sauce is delicious.</p>

<ol>
<li>Rub the pork loin with salt and pepper. Tie the loin with kitchen twine so that it will hold its shape during cooking (or ask the butcher to tie the loin for you).</li>
<li>In a Dutch oven or heavy stockpot, heat the lard and the olive oil (or, if you prefer, olive oil only) over medium heat. Add the onions, and sauté them for 5 to 10 minutes, until they soften and begin to brown.</li>
<li>Put the pork into the pot, and raise the heat to medium-high. Cook the pork, turning it several times, for about 10 minutes, until it is lightly browned on all sides.</li>
<li>Reduce the heat to medium, add the milk, and cover the pot. Cook the pork for about 1 hour, until the meat is cooked through.</li>
<li>Spoon the remaining contents of the pot into a blender or food processor and purée them. Heat the sauce gently in a saucepan, if necessary, then pour it into a pitcher.</li>
<li>Cut the twine from the pork, and slice it. Serve it with the sauce passed separately.</li>

<blockquote><p class="left"><b>N<span style="font-size: smaller">OTE</span>:</b> <em>Pork loin is often sold as roasts larger than 3 pounds. If you buy a larger piece of loin, cut off the excess meat (or ask the butcher to do so), and serve it as 1-inch-thick fillets or medallions. Or follow the recipe for Marinated Pork Loin with Roasted Red Peppers (<a href="c068.xml#p112">[&gt;]</a>).</em></p></blockquote>
