<p class="first">My good friend Felisa Madariaga, who owns one of the loveliest Basque farmhouses I have ever seen, always treats me to special Basque dishes whenever I visit to buy choricero peppers, which she dries in glorious bunches hanging from the front of the house. This luscious dessert is one of her specialties, and well worth the time it takes to make it. Use high-quality vanilla ice cream, or treat yourself to scoops of the Cream-Cheese Ice Cream <a href="c132.xml#p214">[&gt;]</a>. It is interesting to note that whereas the Romans introduced "English" walnuts to Europe, it was Basque sailors who carried them to California, which today is a major producer of the nuts. Be sure to cook the purée for at least 30 minutes, longer if you prefer it thicker.</p>

<li>Using a mortar and pestle, crush the walnuts until they are ground fine but not quite a paste. (You can use a food processor for this if you take great care not to overprocess the nuts.)</li>
<li>In a large saucepan, combine the water and cinnamon stick. Bring the water to a boil over high heat. Add the walnuts, reduce the heat to medium, and cook for about 20 minutes, until the water is almost completely evaporated and the ground nuts are very thick. Discard the cinnamon stick.</li>
<li>Add the milk and sugar to the saucepan, and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, for about 30 minutes, until the mixture is slightly thickened. If you'd like a thicker mixture, cook it for 5 to 10 minutes more, or even longer. Let the purée cool in the pan, and then cover and chill the purée for at least 2 hours.</li>
<li>Spoon the purée into small bowls, and top each serving with a scoop of ice cream. Serve immediately.</li>

<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p218"/> Pacharán</h4>
<p class="first"><em>Although it is</em> <em>made</em> in Navarra, <em>pacharán</em> is a popular liqueur throughout the Basque Country. We serve it poured over ice as a sweet after-dinner drink. Pacharan is made by adding sloeberries <em>(endrinas)</em> and three or four coffee beans to a bottle of <em>anis</em> (anisette). The mixture is allowed to age in a dark place for several months. The result is a golden-red liqueur. Pacharan is available in liquor stores in the United States.</p>
