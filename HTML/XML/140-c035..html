<p class="first">In the Basque Country we would serve this dish as a first course, with bread that has been fried in olive oil. These mushrooms can also make a lovely accompaniment, however, to grilled or broiled chicken or beef or another main course. Look for fresh, firm mushrooms, each about 2 inches in diameter. Of the mushrooms commonly available in the United States, I prefer shiitakes, for their aroma and subtle flavor. You could substitute another variety, however.</p>

<li>Preheat the oven to 500°F. Lightly rub a shallow baking pan with olive oil.</li>
<li>Arrange the mushrooms, stem side up, in the baking pan.</li>

<li>In a small bowl, whisk together the oil, parsley, and garlic, and season with salt to taste. Spoon some of the mixture onto each mushroom. Bake the mushrooms for about 10 minutes, or until they soften and are lightly browned. Serve immediately.</li>

<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p61"/> Marichu: Two Basque Restaurants in New York</h4>
<p class="first"><em>My restaurants,</em> one in Manhattan and the other in Bronxville, New York, are Basque to the core. Both are named Marichu, after my mother, who taught me most of what I know about cooking. I work hard to insure that the food is authentic, prepared much as the food I grew up with was prepared. Many Americans think that Basque food can't be very different from French or Italian food, or even as good. I hope that, by eating at my restaurants and reading this book, Americans will come to recognize Basque culinary traditions as being as dintinct and rich as any others. Knowledgeable food lovers throughout Europe, in fact, know that if the phrase <em>a la vasca</em> ("in the Basque style") follows a menu offering at a Spanish restaurant, that dish is the best choice for the meal. This is because Basque food, although not always dramatically different from that of surrounding regions, is indisputably the best.</p>
<p class="follow">When a customer enters either of the Marichu restaurants, it is my hope that he or she is transported away from New York to northern Spain, where Basque cooks carefully prepare fresh, full-flavored dishes that echo the magnificent food that has been served in the Basque Country for generations. If I stubbornly make only a very few concessions to American palates, it is because I am passionate about the food of my homeland. And it is part of this passion that compels me to open the doors to the restaurants every day to welcome our patrons with the sense of fun, joy, and warmth that defines the Basques.</p>
