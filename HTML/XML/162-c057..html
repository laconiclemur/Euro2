<p class="first">My mother made this thrifty, hearty meal on many winter Sundays. Although time-consuming to prepare, the dish is worth the effort because it is an entire meal: You serve the broth as soup for a first course, and then the rest of the ingredients on a platter for the main course. Save this recipe for when you're feeding a small crowd, or plan to have plenty of leftovers.</p>

<p class="follow"><a id="p92"/> When I was a girl, the bone marrow, served separately, caused many disputes at the table—there was never enough to satisfy us! I have made the bones optional here, however, because so many of us have gotten out of the habit of cooking with them.</p>

<li>To prepare the chickpeas, put them into a large pot or bowl with enough cold water to cover them by 1 to 2 inches. Soak them for at least 8 hours. Drain them, then wrap the soaked chickpeas in a double layer of cheesecloth. Tie the cheesecloth closed with a piece of kitchen twine.</li>
<li>In a large stockpot, combine the chickpeas, in the cheesecloth; the ham bone and marrow bones, if you're using them; the beef shanks, chicken legs, leeks, and parsley; salt to taste; and 5 quarts water. Bring the contents to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat, and simmer gently for about 2½ hours. Several times during the simmering, skim the foam that rises to the surface.</li>

<li><a id="p93"/> Add the chorizos, carrots, and potatoes to the stockpot, and simmer gently for about 1 hour longer, until the vegetables are very soft and the meat is thoroughly cooked.</li>
<li>While the meat and vegetables cook, prepare the cabbage. Bring 3 quarts water to a boil in a large saucepan or stockpot. Add the cabbage and salt, and boil for about 30 minutes, or until the cabbage is very soft. Drain it thoroughly.</li>
<li>In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and, when it is golden, the cabbage. Cook them, stirring, for about 10 minutes, until the flavors blend. Remove the skillet from the heat.</li>
<li>Strain the broth from the meat, bones, and vegetables, and transfer the broth to a large saucepan or another stockpot. Add the pasta, and bring the broth to a boil over high heat. Cook the pasta for about 15 minutes, until it is tender.</li>
<li>While the pasta cooks, shred the meat from the beef shanks and the chicken legs, and arrange the meat on a serving platter. Cut the sausages, carrots, and potatoes into pieces, and arrange them on the platter, too. Discard the leeks, parsley, and ham bone.</li>
<li>If you like, scrape the marrow from the marrow bones, and put it into a small dish. Discard the bones.</li>
<li>Unwrap the chickpeas, and transfer them to a serving bowl. Cover the bowl, and keep the chickpeas warm.</li>
<li>Reheat the cabbage in the skillet over medium heat. When the cabbage is hot, arrange it on the platter so that it surrounds the rest of the food.</li>
<li>Serve the pasta and broth as soup, then serve the meat and vegetables as the main course. Accompany the meat and vegetables with the Tomato Sauce, the chickpeas, and, if you like, the marrow.</li>
