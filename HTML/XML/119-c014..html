<p class="first">Foie gras is the fattened liver of waterfowl that are hand-fed for at least 30 days, during which time they are allowed very little exercise. The result is a large liver with a silken texture and glorious flavor. In the United States, it is becoming increasingly easy to buy foie gras. If you can't locate a source, call Hudson Valley Foie Gras (516-773-4400), or visit the website at <a href="http://www.foiegras.com">www.foiegras.com</a>, for the number of a distributor near your home. Owned by my friend Michael Ginor, Hudson Valley is the largest foie gras producer in the world. Or order foie gras direct from D'Artagnan (800-DARTAGNAN or 973-344-0565), a New Jersey company that ships specialty meats all over the United States.</p>
<p class="follow"><a id="p29"/> Although most people associate foie gras with France, we have been enjoying it in the Basque Country for a long time—particularly during the past thirty years, when our cuisine has expanded in scope. The Basque Country, after all, is quite close to Landes, France, a region well known for its geese farms.</p>
<p class="follow">There are other ways to prepare foie gras, but I particularly like this simple preparation, in which the liver is quickly sauteed and served over sauteed, lightly sweetened apples. At the very end of cooking, I make a quick pan sauce using port and the fat remaining in the pan; such deglazing is common in Basque cooking, and it's a technique that rarely lets you down.</p>

<li>Using your fingers, carefully separate the liver into its two sections. For the sake of appearance, try to pull out any visible veins. Cut each liver half crosswise into 1-inch-thick slices. Sprinkle them lightly with salt and white pepper.</li>
<li>In a nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low, add the apple wedges, and cook them for about 15 minutes, turning them often, until they soften. Sprinkle them with the sugar, raise the heat to medium-high, and shake the pan to prevent burning. Cook the apples for a few minutes longer, until they are golden brown. Arrange four wedges on each of four plates. Cover the plates to keep the apples warm.</li>
<li>To cook the liver, heat two nonstick skillets over high heat. When they are very hot, distribute the liver pieces evenly between the dry skillets (the liver will release all the fat you need), shaking the pans to prevent sticking. Cook the liver for about 2 minutes on each side, until it is golden brown. Remove the pans from the heat to prevent overcooking, and lift the liver from the pans. Drain it on two layers of paper towels.</li>
<li>In one of the skillets, combine the fat remaining in both. Add the wine, and turn the heat to high. Cook, stirring, for about 30 seconds, until the sauce is hot and blended.</li>
<li>On each plate, arrange a portion of the liver next to the apples, and spoon the sauce over the liver. Serve immediately.</li>
