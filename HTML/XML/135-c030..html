<p class="first">Because making this dish is time-consuming, my mother did not prepare it as frequently as we all wanted when my brothers and sisters and I were growing up in Bilbao. Much later, when I had children of my own, I understood her reluctance. And so, like her, I generally reserve this dish for special occasions, usually in the springtime, when the vegetables are in season. I typically serve this as a first course, but it could be a side dish, too.</p>

<li>Rub the artichokes with a lemon half.</li>
<li>In a stockpot, bring 4 to 5 cups of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the flour and the second lemon half, and stir gently. Add the artichokes, and cook them over medium-high heat (or at a low boil) for about 30 to 45 minutes, until they are tender. Drain them in a colander, and set them aside. When they are cool enough to handle, cut them in half lengthwise.</li>
<li><a id="p55"/> While the artichokes cook, bring 3 to 4 cups of lightly salted water to a boil over medium-high heat in a large saucepan. Cook the lettuce leaves, fully submerged, for about 5 minutes, until they are wilted. Carefully lift the leaves from the water, and drain them in a colander, pressing them against the side of the colander with the back of a spoon to extract as much moisture as possible.</li>
<li>Let the water return to a boil, add the Swiss chard, and cook it for about 15 minutes, until it is fork-tender. Drain it, and set it aside.</li>
<li>In the stockpot, bring another 4 to 5 cups of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the milk and the cauliflower, and cook the cauliflower over medium-high heat (at a low boil) for about 15 minutes, until it is tender. Drain it, and set it aside.</li>
<li>While the cauliflower cooks, bring 3 to 4 cups of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat in a separate stockpot. Add the potatoes and carrots, and cook them over medium-high heat (at a low boil) for about 15 minutes, until they are fork-tender. Drain them, and set them aside.</li>
<li>In the pan in which you cooked the lettuce and chard, bring 2 to 3 cups of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the peas, and cook them over medium-high heat (at a low boil) for about 5 minutes. Drain them, and set them aside.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
<li>Spread the remaining 3 tablespoons of flour on a flat plate or a wax paper-lined tray. Put the eggs into a shallow bowl. In a large skillet, heat ¾ cup of the olive oil over medium-high heat.</li>
<li>While the oil heats, tear the lettuce into small pieces, and form them into 2-inch patties with your fingers.</li>
<li>Dredge the artichokes, lettuce patties, and Swiss chard in the flour, and then dip them in the eggs. When the oil in the skillet is hot, reduce the heat to medium. Cook the artichokes, lettuce, and chard in the skillet, a few pieces at a time so as not to crowd the pan, for 3 to 4 minutes, turning them once, until they are lightly browned. Lift the vegetables from the skillet, and drain them on paper towels.</li>
<li>In a large casserole, arrange all the vegetables attractively in groups so that each type is visible.</li>
<li>Heat the remaining ¼ cup oil in the skillet over medium-high heat, and add the ham. Sauté it for 2 to 3 minutes, until it is lightly browned. Pour the ham, oil, and broth over the vegetables, and season them to taste with salt. Arrange the eggs over the top of the vegetables, cover the casserole, and bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until the vegetables are heated through. Serve immediately.</li>
