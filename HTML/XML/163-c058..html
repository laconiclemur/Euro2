<p class="first">The Navarrans are well known for their expertise with canned foods, including sweet, tender white asparagus as well as piquillo peppers. There's a joke going around my hometown that two gentlemen from Navarra, upon first encountering the dramatic building for the new Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, wondered aloud about the size and number of asparagus spears it would take to fill the gigantic "can." In my cooking I generally use fresh vegetables, but when it comes to asparagus, I turn to Navarra's canned white spears.</p>
<p class="follow">If you can't find Navarra canned white asparagus locally, you can order it from Northern Boulevard (718-779-4971), a store in Queens, New York. Or use other high-quality canned white asparagus or fresh white asparagus; you'll need about 21 spears.</p>

<li>In a large saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion, and sauté it for about 5 minutes, until it is softened. Set the asparagus tips aside, and mix the remaining asparagus well with the onion. Add the 1 cup canning liquid and the broth, and bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat, and simmer for about 30 minutes, to blend the flavors.</li>

<li>Add the cream, and simmer for about 10 minutes longer, taking care not to let the cream boil. Season to taste with salt. Transfer the mixture to a blender or food processor, and blend it nearly to a purée (you may have to do this in batches). Pour the soup through a fine-mesh strainer, and serve it warm, garnished with chives and the reserved asparagus tips.</li>

<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p95"/> The Guggenheim in Bilbao</h4>
<p class="first"><em>One of the architectural masterworks</em> of the late twentieth century is the Guggenheim Bilbao Museum, which opened its doors to the public in October of 1997. The museum continues the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation's tradition of combining excellence in art with excellence in architecture, a concept realized when Frank Lloyd Wright designed the world-famous Guggenheim Museum on Fifth Avenue in New York City. Frank O. Gehry continued this tradition with his design for the striking museum now standing in Bilbao.</p>
<p class="follow">The sober, square stone administration building contrasts sharply with the mammoth glass walls and curved, titanium-covered shapes of the structure that houses the works of art. Inside, the collection consists mainly of works by the most prominent artists of the past half century, but it also includes classic works by Chagall, Kandinsky, Matisse, and Picasso. Having invigorated Bilbao far beyond any predictions, the museum makes a trip to the city more appealing than ever.</p>
