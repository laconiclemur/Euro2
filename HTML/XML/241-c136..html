<p class="first">Any student of French cuisine will recognize the similarity between this tart and <em>tarte tatin,</em> the upside-down apple tart so beloved for its lightly caramelized apples. The Basque version is equally tempting and delicious, and, because my recipe calls for store-bought puff pastry, the preparation is very simple. I like to serve this with Sweet Basque Cream (<a href="c127.xml#p208">[&gt;]</a>).</p>

<li>Preheat the oven to 300°F.</li>
<li>Spread the butter on the bottom and sides of a 10-inch pie plate.</li>
<li>In a very heavy saucepan (preferably copper), cook the sugar over low heat, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, for 5 to 6 minutes, until the sugar melts. Raise the heat slightly, and cook for about 5 minutes longer, washing the sugar crystals down the side of the pan with a pastry brush dipped in a cup of ice water. As soon as the sugar turns a caramel color, pour it into the pie plate, tipping the plate so the sugar covers the bottom and flows up the side. Take care when handling the caramelized sugar; it is very hot.</li>
<li>Lay the apple wedges over the sugar, arranging them so that the broad sides lie flat on the bottom in concentric circles. Fill in the gaps with the remaining wedges, narrow sides down, broad sides up.</li>
<li>Lay the sheets of puff pastry over the apples, overlapping the sheets. Tuck in the puff pastry at the edge of the pie plate, and trim off the excess.</li>
<li>Bake the tart on the center rack of the oven for about 1 hour, until the crust is golden brown. Set the tart in its pan on a wire rack, and let it rest until the crust is cool; the apples should still be warm. Invert the tart onto a platter, cut it into wedges, and serve it warm.</li>
