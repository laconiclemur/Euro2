<p class="first">Europeans have always love chestnuts, and nowhere is this appreciation more evident than in this sweet dessert soup. According to all accounts, the soup has been made since very early times in the rural areas of Navarra, adjacent to the Basque Country. Interestingly, across the border in the French Basque country, you will find a similar soup made with the addition of vegetables and served as an appetizer.</p>
<p class="follow">Because this soup is so rich and because chestnuts are in season in the fall, I usually serve it on chilly nights. I like to cook it in a glazed earthenware casserole, in the tradition of the Basque Country.</p>

<li>Preheat the oven to 400°F.</li>
<li>Using a sharp knife, slit the flat side of each chestnut, and lay the chestnuts in a single layer on an ungreased baking sheet. Roast them for about 15 minutes, until they are fragrant. Remove the baking sheet from the oven, but do not turn the oven off. When the chestnuts are cool enough to handle, shell them, and transfer the nutmeats to a saucepan.</li>
<li>Add the milk to the pan, and heat it over medium-high heat until it boils. Add the cinnamon stick and 2 tablespoons sugar, reduce the heat to low, and simmer gently for about 15 minutes, stirring several times, until the nuts are soft.</li>
<li>Strain the milk into a casserole or clay dish, reserving the nutmeats. Lay the bread slices on top of the milk, and sprinkle them with sugar and cinnamon. Put the dish into the oven for about 10 minutes, until the bread and milk crust over. (Alternatively, you can set the dish under the broiler for several minutes, until the bread and milk crust over. If you use a broiler, though, watch carefully to prevent scorching.) Garnish with the chestnuts, and serve.</li>
