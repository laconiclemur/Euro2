<p class="first">Piquillo peppers, canned in Navarra, are available in many specialty-foods stores in the United States, and you can order them from Northern Boulevard (718-779-4971). But you can also substitute roasted whole green or red bell peppers for this very special stuffed pepper dish. In fact, my mother always used bell peppers when I was growing up, because piquillo peppers were rarely available then even in the Basque Country. When they became easier to find, however, she switched to them because of their outstanding flavor—and also, I imagine, because they came already roasted and peeled. If you decide to use bell peppers, choose small ones and serve only two per person, instead of four of the smaller piquillos.</p>

<li><a id="p126"/> Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
<li>In a small bowl, combine the bread pieces and wine, and set the bowl aside.</li>
<li>In a larger bowl, combine the pork and beef. Salt the meat lightly, mix it well, and set the bowl aside.</li>
<li>In a skillet, heat ¼ cup of the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, and sauté them for about 5 minutes, until they are softened. Add the ground meat, and cook, stirring, until the onion and garlic are incorporated and the meat begins to brown. Add the parsley, bread pieces, and any wine not absorbed by the bread, and mix well. Cook the mixture for about 5 minutes, then remove the pan from the heat. Let the mixture cool slightly.</li>
<li>With a small spoon, carefully stuff each pepper with some of the meat, taking care not to tear the pepper. Close the top of the pepper with crossed toothpicks.</li>
<li>Spread the flour in a shallow dish. Put the eggs into a separate shallow dish. Lay the peppers in the flour, and turn them to coat them completely. Then put them into the egg, and turn them to coat them.</li>
<li>In a clean skillet, heat the remaining 6 tablespoons oil over medium heat. Cook the peppers in batches for about 2 minutes on each side, just until they are lightly browned. Drain them on two layers of paper towels.</li>
<li>Arrange the peppers in a shallow casserole just large enough to hold them upright without crowding. Spoon the sauce over them, and bake them, uncovered, for about 15 minutes, until the meat is hot. Serve immediately.</li>
