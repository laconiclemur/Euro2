<p class="first">There is not a bar or a party in Basque Country that does not offer <em>tortilla de patata</em> as a pincho. This extremely popular dish is excellent accompanied by a small glass of wine, but it can also be cut into large pieces and served as a light entrée with a green salad, making a fine light meal for vegetarians, especially. <em>Tortilla de patata</em> is also common picnic fare, and it's a popular sandwich, or <em>bocadillo,</em> filling. I make this omelet often, and it has saved me more than once when I had to make an unplanned meal, because the ingredients are household staples.</p>
<p class="follow">The omelet may sound complicated to make, since it is removed from the pan and then returned for further cooking, but after you have tried this once or twice, you will find it is very easy—as long as you have a plate that is a little larger in diameter than the pan.</p>

<li>In a large skillet (about 10 inches in diameter), heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion, and sauté it for about 5 minutes, until it is light golden. Add the potatoes, and season them to taste with salt. Reduce the heat to medium, and cook the potatoes for about 15 minutes longer, stirring, until they are tender.</li>
<li>Raise the heat to medium-high, and cook the potatoes for 1 to 2 minutes longer, until they are lightly browned, crisp on the outside, and soft on the inside. Using a large slotted spoon, remove the potatoes and onion from the pan, and drain them in a colander or on paper towels. Let the oil in the pan cool slightly, then pour all but about 1½ teaspoons into another container to use later.</li>

<li><a id="p11"/> In a large bowl, beat the eggs lightly. Add the potatoes and onion, and mix well. Set the mixture aside for a few minutes.</li>
<li>Heat the skillet over high heat, tipping the pan to assure that the oil is evenly distributed. When it is very hot, pour the egg mixture into the pan. Use a spatula to spread the mixture evenly in the skillet. Shake the pan gently to prevent sticking and burning, and cook the omelet for about 1 minute. Reduce the heat to medium, and continue cooking the omelet for 2 or 3 minutes longer, until the eggs begin to set around the edges.</li>
<li>Lay over the skillet a plate that is slightly larger in diameter than the skillet. Using one hand to hold the plate in place, invert the omelet onto it. (Do this over a clean work surface for insurance.)</li>
<li>Return the empty skillet to the stove, add another 1½ teaspoons of the reserved oil, and heat it over high heat. When the oil is hot, slide the omelet off the plate and into the pan (the uncooked side should be facing down). Shake the pan gently to prevent sticking, and cook the omelet for 1 minute. Reduce the heat to medium, and cook for about 3 minutes longer, until the omelet is set. Slide the omelet onto a serving plate, and let the omelet cool.</li>
<li>Cut the omelet into 20 small squares or wedges, and serve them skewered with toothpicks or on top of thin slices of bread.</li>
