<p class="first">Salt cod, or <em>bacalao,</em> is eaten throughout the Basque Country, and just about everyone there loves this ancient way of cooking it. When I serve <em>bacalao al</em> pil pil at the restaurant, it is extremely well received by my customers, too. And John Mariani, a food critic for <em>Esquire</em> and <em>Travel and Leisure,</em> came home from a visit to the Basque Country particularly impressed with this dish.</p>
<p class="follow"><em>Bacalao al pil pil</em> is technically difficult to make, but not too hard for the home cook to master. I highly recommend using a high-quality clay casserole, as we do at home. The casserole must be flame-proof and not too heavy. Many cookware stores and some large specialty-foods stores carry such casseroles, and you can also order them from Northern Boulevard (718-779-4971) in Queens, New York.</p>
<p class="follow">Be sure to use olive oil for the <em>pil pil;</em> another oil will not achieve the same emulsion. You'll need a full-bodied olive oil.</p>
<p class="follow">If you use a hot pepper, it should be only mildly hot, and flexible enough to cut into rings.</p>

<li>In a shallow bowl, cover the fish with cold water. Refrigerate the fish for 24 to 36 hours, changing the water every 8 hours or so. Drain the fish on paper or cloth towels.</li>
<li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and, if you like, the pepper, and cook them for 3 or 4 minutes, until the garlic is golden brown. Set the skillet aside until the garlic and pepper cool slightly. When they are cool enough to handle, remove the garlic and pepper, and reserve both for garnish. Keep the olive oil warm in the skillet.</li>
<li><a id="p152"/> Pat the salt cod dry. Using a small, sharp knife, scrape off the scales, taking care not to remove the skin. Put the fish in a separate skillet, and cover it with cold water. Bring the water to a simmer over medium heat, and cook the fish for 10 minutes, making sure that the water never boils.
<br/>Remove the salt cod, and drain it on paper or cloth towels. Reserve ½ cup of the liquid. When the fish is cool, carefully remove the bones, taking care not to break the fish into smaller pieces. (Removing the bones is much easier after cooking than before.)</li>
<li>Lay the fish skin-side up in a 12-inch-diameter earthenware casserole. Set the casserole over low heat, and add the reserved warm olive oil 1 tablespoon at a time while shaking the casserole with a rhythmic, circular motion. Never add the next tablespoon until the one preceding it has been incorporated into the emulsion. The oil will help release the gelatin under the fish skin so that as you proceed a white sauce, resembling a light mayonnaise, will develop. The sauce will take from 15 to 30 minutes to make, depending on the quality of the cod and the olive oil. If the emulsion isn't developing, sprinkle over the sauce some of the liquid in which the cod simmered, and continue shaking the casserole.</li>
<li>To serve, put two pieces of cod on each plate, and spoon some of the sauce from the casserole over it. Garnish the plates with the reserved garlic and the hot pepper, if you've used it.</li>

<blockquote><p class="left"><b>N<span style="font-size: smaller">OTE</span>:</b> <em>It's important to leave the skin on the cod when you scrape off the scales, because the skin contains a gelatinous substance that is essential to making the sauce. If you reheat this dish, begin the process in a 350°F oven, and then complete the heating on the stove, shaking the dish in the same circular motion. For a successful emulsion, be sure the olive oil is the same temperature as the fish; both should be warm.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="left"><b>V<span style="font-size: smaller">ARIATION</span>:</b></p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="left"><b>S<span style="font-size: smaller">ALT</span> C<span style="font-size: smaller">OD</span> C<span style="font-size: smaller">LUB</span> R<span style="font-size: smaller">ANERO</span>-S<span style="font-size: smaller">TYIE</span></b></p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="left"><b>Bacalao al Club Ranero</b></p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="left">Around 1900, Alejandro Caveriviere, a famed French chef, moved to Bilbao, where he worked until his retirement in 1936 in several elegant, trend-setting restaurants and clubs. While working at one of these establishments, he reportedly combined two classic Basque recipes, <em>bacalao al pil pil</em> and <em>pisto a la bilbaína</em> (Vegetable Stew, <a href="c026.xml#p51">[&gt;]</a>) to create an entirely different dish.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="follow">To make Codfish Club Ranero-Style, prepare the pil pil as described in the recipe. Add 2 cups of the pisto (made without the eggs!), and shake the casserole with a circular motion over low heat until all the ingredients are evenly mixed. Serve the dish warm. If you are using leftover pil pil, reduce the amount of pisto accordingly.</p></blockquote>
