<p class="first">My older brother Valeriano is an avid hunter and fisherman. During our summer vacations by the sea in Mundaka, he spent all day fishing with his harpoon, but as soon as autumn arrived he hunted upland game nearly every weekend. When he came home with quails, my mother frequently prepared them as I describe here. The bit of chocolate ("a piece about the size of a chestnut," my mother explained) adds richness to the sauce for the little birds.</p>

<li>Sprinkle the quails with the salt, and, if the butcher hasn't done so, truss them. Do this by folding the legs and tying them against the body with cotton string.</li>
<li>In a large pot, heat 1 cup of olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions, carrots, garlic, parsley, and peppercorns. Raise the heat to high, and cook the vegetables, stirring with a wooden spoon, for about 10 minutes, until the onions begin to brown.</li>

<li><a id="p135"/> Add the quails, and cook them for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, until they are lightly browned.</li>
<li>Add the wine and vinegar, and cover the pan. Cook the quails over medium-low heat for about 30 minutes, or until the juices run clear when the quails are pricked in the thigh with a small sharp knife or a fork. With a slotted spoon, transfer the quails to a platter. Cover them, and keep them warm.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, bring a saucepan of water to a boil over high heat, and add the pearl onions, if you are using them. Reduce the heat, and simmer the onions for about 20 minutes, until they are tender. Drain them, and set them aside.</li>
<li>Stir the liquid in the pan in which the quails were cooked, and add a little water if the liquid is too thick. Add the chocolate, and stir until it is melted and blended with the pan juices. Add the pearl onions, if you are using them, and stir gently. Return the quails to the pan, and, continuously spooning the sauce over them, cook them over low heat for about 10 minutes, until the sauce is thick and coats the quails.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, in a skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat. Lay the bread in the oil, and fry the bread for about 1 minute on each side, until it is lightly browned.</li>
<li>Untruss the quails. Lay the bread on serving plates, and top each slice with two quails. Spoon the sauce over the quails, and garnish each serving with four pearl onions, if you like.</li>
