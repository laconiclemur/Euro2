<p class="left"><a id="p98"/> <em>When I was a 20-year-old student, weighing about 100 pounds, I could eat a three-pound steak without blinking an eye. Now I am more moderate in my consumption of red meat, but the fact remains that we Basques adore oversized steaks. They are commonly prepared in</em> txokos, <em>our famed gastronomic societies, and in</em> asadores <em>(grill houses), as are other charcoal-grilled and pan-cooked meats. As soon as the huge steaks are lifted from the heat, they are sprinkled with coarse sea salt,</em> <em>which makes them especially delicious. Although beef is the Basque favorite, we like other red meats, too. Our sheep farmers breed their flocks all year long so that we have tender lamb whenever we want it. Still, the best lamb seems to be available in the spring, and I can think of no better meal than one of sweet, tender, almost-white young lamb. For my restaurants, a Basque farmer in upstate New York supplies me with very young lamb year round. Basques also like pork, so here you will find recipes for pork loin, fresh ham, and even young suckling pig, a typically Castillian treat loved by Basques. Since we are great hunters and sportsmen, we are also fond of venison, and so I have included a recipe that in Spain we prepare with roe deer. Roe deer is not available in the United States, but any venison works well. And because we Basques frequently eat organ meats, such as brains, kidneys, tripe, and liver, I have included a recipe for lamb liver and another for veal kidneys just to give you a taste of how delicious these cuts can be.</em></p>
<p class="follow"><a id="p99"/> <em>We eat as much chicken as we do any other meat. Although the Basques are subjected to mass-produced, plastic-wrapped supermarket chickens just as is anyone in the industrialized world, we fortunately have good access to free-range poultry. Usually a short drive into the countryside is all that's needed to find a farmer raising and selling free-range chickens. They are</em> <em>becoming increasingly easy to find in the United States, too, in butcher shops and even supermarkets, and I highly recommend that you try them. No chicken tastes better than a happy hen, who has been permitted to scratch for her food and exercise her muscles in a farmyard.</em></p>
<p class="follow"><a id="p100"/> <em>Basques also enjoy other poultry, as well as game birds such as quail and pheasant. I include a recipe for duck, which Basques have eaten for generations. Although my mother rarely cooked it when I was growing up, duck is now quite fashionable in the Basque Country.</em></p>
<p class="follow"><em>Fish is integral to the Basque diet. Whether rich or poor, we Basques buy the best fresh fish that we can. Because lunch tends to be the larger of our two main meals, we usually choose lighter fare for dinner, which often means fish—but sometimes we eat fish at both meals. We insist on only one thing: that the fish be as fresh as possible. Of course, there is one notable exception to this caveat, and that is salt cod. Basques love it. I have included quite a few recipes for salt cod (as well as for fresh cod), since without it a Basque's culinary life would be bereft indeed.</em></p>
<p class="follow"><em>As you will find as you read the notes preceding the recipes in this chapter, when I was young my family was one of avid sports fishermen. In the summer, my father and brothers spent hours on the sea, fishing for everything with fins or tentacles. And my mother cooked it all, much to our joy</em> <em>then and my continued delight now. Most of the preparations included here are hers. The method I use to sauté hake and scrod fillets might seem unusual to the uninitiated, but I hope you will try it. Whisking the egg whites just until they are opaque and beginning to thicken (the snow point, I call it), aerates them just enough so that they coat the fish with a lovely, light, and gently puffed exterior.</em></p>
<p class="follow"><a id="p101"/> <em>Basques are not inclined to buy fish wrapped in plastic at the supermarket. We prefer to smell the faint brininess of fresh fish and see their clear eyes and firm scales. In the Basque Country, all types of fish and shellfish are sold in small markets and in large market halls, beautifully displayed on chipped ice. As has been the tradition for centuries, the selling stalls are run by women, because the men are out at sea on their boats, catching fish for the next day's meals. (No one buys fish on Monday since Sunday is the fishermen's day of rest.) If you travel to Bilbao, be sure to visit the Mercado de la Ribera, the large multilevel market selling produce on one floor, meat and poultry on another, and fish on a third. A spectacular feast for the senses, it will provide the casual visitor with a good overview of our favorite foods.</em></p>
