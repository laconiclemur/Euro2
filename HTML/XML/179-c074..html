<p class="first">Baby lamb is a traditional springtime treat in the Basque Country, and in my restaurant I serve it year round; a Basque farmer in upstate New York sends me baby lambs monthly. If you can find baby lamb in a butcher's shop, try it. Never older than a month, it will have been fed exclusively with ewe's milk, making the meat tender, mild, and delicious. If baby lamb isn't available where you live, you can substitute a leg of more mature lamb.</p>

<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 450°F.</li>
<li>To prepare the lamb, rub it with the salt, rosemary, and olive oil. Put it into a shallow roasting pan, sprinkle it with a little water, and place the pan in the oven. Put a small oven-proof bowl or pan filled with water on the lowest rack of the oven, and leave it there while the meat roasts. Roast the meat for 1 hour. Turn the lamb over, and roast it for about 30 minutes to 1 hour longer, until it is done to your taste. While the lamb roasts, sprinkle it with water every 10 minutes or so.</li>
<li>Let the lamb stand for about 10 minutes after removing it from the oven. Collect the pan juices to use in the sauce.</li>
<li>To prepare the sauce, combine the water, vinegar, and rosemary in a saucepan, and bring them to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, and cook the mixture for about 10 minutes, until it is slightly reduced. Strain the mixture, and return it to the pan. Add the oil, cornstarch, and pan juices, and whisk well. Bring the sauce to a boil over medium-high heat, and cook it for 2 to 3 minutes, until it has thickened.</li>
<li>Carve the lamb, and serve each portion with some of the sauce.</li>

<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p123"/> Sports in the Basque Country</h4>
<p class="first"><em>The best-known</em> Basque sport is jai-alai, whose name means "gay game" or "joyful game." The best jai-alai players always attract crowds of enthusiastic fans.</p>
<p class="follow">Jai-alai is always played in three-walled courts, called <em>frontons,</em> but the game has several forms. <em>Cesta-punta</em> is played with a curved basket of wicker woven over chestnut wood, which is grooved for catching and throwing the ball at great speeds. <em>Remonte</em> is similar to <em>cesta-punta</em> but is played with a less curved and more compact basket. <em>Pala</em> is played with a short paddle and a heavier ball.</p>
<p class="follow"><em>Cesta-punta</em> is the only form of jai-alai that has taken hold in other parts of the world. My grandfather Claudio was one of the best <em>cesta-punta</em> players of his day; he was asked to play at the inauguration of Havana's <em>fronton</em> in 1920. He also played in the Philippines, Alexandria, Milan, Mexico, and Buenos Aires, to name only a few of the places where jai-alai became popular. Today in the United States, jai-alai is played in <em>frontons</em> in Nevada, Connecticut, and Florida.</p>
<p class="follow">Other Basque games are tests of endurance and strength. For example, <em>estropadaks</em> are small rowing boats with fixed seats that we use for racing. The best-known of the competitive <em>estropadak</em> regattas is held on the first Sunday of September, when thousands of fans gather in San Sebastián to watch and cheer. <em>Aizkoloriak</em> is a competition for brawny men who race the clock as they split huge tree logs with axes. <em>Harrija-sotzaileak</em> is another competition of brute strength, where men lift stones of different shapes and sizes, some of which can weigh as much as 300 kilograms (660 pounds).</p>
<p class="follow">Common to all sports and games is betting, a favorite spectator sport on the streets in the Basque Country.</p>
