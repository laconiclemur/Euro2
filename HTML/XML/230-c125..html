<p class="first">During the last years of his long life, my grandfather Claudio lived alone in Markina, where he owned several country houses and orchards. He often asked my brother, Manu, to pick the ripe Reineta apples—which are firm, tart, and incredibly delicious—and store them in the attic of one of the houses. When Claudio saw a new crop ripen, he instructed my brother to give away the stored apples to make room for the fresh. This made little sense to my brother, and, since Claudio's mind was not as sharp as it had been, my brother instead gave most of the fresh harvest to my aunts, who lived nearby, without telling my grandfather. My aunts gave many of the apples away, but, even so, they had more than their families could eat raw, and so very often made this apple purée. You can multiply the ingredients depending on the quantity of apples you have. Serve the purée with pork or game.</p>

<li>Pass the mixture through a food mill, or purée it in a blender or food processor until it is smooth and thick. Serve it warm.</li>
