<h1 class="chaptertitle"><a id="p203"/> DESSERTS</h1>
<p class="first"/>

<p class="left"><a id="p204"/> W<em>e Basques eat two three-course meals every day, with the third course being dessert. Although many meals conclude with only a piece of ripe fruit, when a meal ends with a sweet, luscious dessert we are very happy.</em></p>
<p class="follow"><em>Our desserts are simple, homey fare. Most are made with ingredients commonly found in every kitchen—eggs, milk, and sugar—and consequently tend to be smooth, rich, and custardy. Modern desserts prepared by adventuresome chefs in today's expensive restaurants are perhaps more elegant than these, but I want to share traditional Basque recipes, immediately recognizable by Basques of all generations. So <a href="c126.xml#p207">[&gt;]</a> you will find a simple custard tart—a recipe my youngest children mastered before I did! Here also are old-fashioned recipes for a creamy rice pudding and a sweet walnut purée, which are nothing if not sinfully good. My favorite dessert,</em> tostadas de crema <em>(or</em> leche frita, "<em>fried milk") is here, too, in all its silken loveliness. This is a treat I rarely had as a child because it is such a bore to prepare, so my otherwise industrious mother usually refused to make it. Still, I ate it whenever possible—it is traditionally served at carnival time in Bilbao—and now I make sure it is always on the restaurant's menu so that I can indulge at whim. And, finally, here is one of our most beloved custard creations, which is also one of the best known. Called</em> natillas, <em>it is a thick, ivory-colored sweet cream sauce very similar to what across the border in France is called</em> crème anglaise.</p>
<p class="follow"><a id="p205"/> <em>We like fruit desserts and nut desserts in the Basque Country, too, and so I have included several recipes that illustrate our special ways with apples, figs, pears, quince, almonds, and chestnuts. The quince dessert <a href="c139.xml#p224">[&gt;]</a> is very interesting because the fruit is cooked until extremely thick and sticky, something not done in very many recipes. And the fig dessert <a href="c138.xml#p223">[&gt;]</a> is more a celebration of delectable fresh figs than an instruction in cooking, but who cares? Served with natillas, the figs are heavenly.</em></p>
<p class="follow"><a id="p206"/> <em>You will notice that there are no desserts here that could be called cakes, in the American sense, and no chocolate desserts. Although cakes and chocolate desserts are available in the Basque Country, they are not classic Basque preparations. I also left out a typical Basque treat called</em> gatzatu, <em>a farmhouse dessert made from sheep's milk, that resembles sweetened yogurt. Gatzatu is delicious, but because sheep's milk is not easy to get in the United States, I omitted the recipe. If you travel to the Basque Country, I hope you will sample gatzatu, as well as many other desserts, the most traditional of which are included here to provide a sweet overview of how we indulge ourselves in the Basque Country.</em></p>
