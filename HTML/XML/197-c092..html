<p class="first">I could not write a book about the cooking of my homeland without including this traditional Basque dish, which relies on salt cod as well as our much-loved Biscayne Sauce. Unhappily, the choricero peppers necessary for the sauce are unavailable in the United States, but you can substitute dried red peppers from California or Mexico for a good, though not quite authentic, sauce. (I have seen recipes for <em>bacalao a la vizcaína</em> in other books, in particular those on Caribbean food, but whereas these versions might be tasty, they are not authentically Basque, either.) I like this dish even more the day after it is made.</p>

<li>In a shallow bowl, cover the fish with cold water. Refrigerate the fish for 24 to 36 hours, changing the water every 8 hours or so.</li>
<li>Transfer the cod to a large saucepan or a stockpot. Add enough cold water to cover the fish by 1 to 2 inches. Over medium heat, bring the water to a simmer; do not let it boil. Simmer the cod for about 10 minutes, until it is tender and flaky. Drain it, pat it dry, and then remove the bones without breaking the cod pieces. (Removing the bones is much easier after cooking than before.) Leave the skin on.</li>
<li>Put the cod skin-side up in a flame-proof earthenware casserole large enough to hold the pieces in a single layer. Spoon the sauce over the cod, and cook over low heat for about 15 minutes, until the fish and sauce are hot. Serve immediately.</li>
