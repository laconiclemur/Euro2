<p class="first">K<em>okotxas</em> are small, flavorful chunks of fish cut from the tip of the lower jaw of cod or hake. In some American fish markets kokotxas are labeled "cod tongue," but they are actually cut apart from the tongue. They can be hard to find in the United States; you may have to ask a few fishmongers before you have success. If you travel in the Basque Country, though, you can order kokotxas at nearly any bar or restaurant. So desirable are these morsels that they often are removed from the fish while still at sea and sold right from the boat as soon as it docks.</p>

<li>If the kokotxas are salted, lay them in a shallow bowl, and cover them with cold water. Refrigerate the kokotxas for 24 to 36 hours, changing the water every 8 hours or so. Drain the kokotxas, and pat them dry. (If you are using fresh hake kokotxas, skip this step.)</li>
<li>Sprinkle the kokotxas with salt and flour, and shake off the excess flour. Pour the eggs into a shallow bowl.</li>
<li>In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Dip a few of the kokotxas into the egg, and then add them to the pan. Reduce the heat to medium, and fry the kokotxas for 2 minutes on each side or until they are lightly browned. Lift them from the pan with a slotted spoon, and drain them on two layers of paper towels. Fry the remaining kokotxas the same way. Serve them hot.</li>

<blockquote><p class="left"><b>N<span style="font-size: smaller">OTE</span>:</b> <em>Portuguese markets with good fish departments sell kokotxas, labeled as tongues. If they are from cod, they are nearly always salted; if they are from hake, they are fresh. Most kokotxas available in the United States are salted. You can use salted kokotxas to make salt cod dishes such as Salt Cod Pil Pil (<a href="c091.xml#p151">[&gt;]</a>).</em></p></blockquote>
