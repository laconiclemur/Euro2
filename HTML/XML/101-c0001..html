<h1 class="chaptertitle"><a id="p7"/> PINCHOS</h1>

<p class="left"><a id="p8"/> Pinchos—<em>or</em> pintxos, <em>as the Basques spell the word—are the Basque Country's singular form of the better known Spanish</em> tapas. <em>The term derives from the Spanish word</em> pinchar, "<em>to prick," because originally pinchos were always served skewered on wooden toothpicks. Today they may be served either on toothpicks or in small earthenware bowls or on platters; they are eaten as finger food. In concept pinchos are similar to tapas; both are bites of tasty nourishment shared with friends in bars and taverns. But tapas evolved in southern Spain, from the old-time practice</em> <em>of laying a slice of bread or meat across the top of a sherry glass (their name derives from the word</em> tapar, "<em>to cover"). Today tapas must usually be eaten with a fork or spoon, and whereas tapas may be small servings of any dish, pinchos are a distinct set of little dishes that are never served at meals.</em></p>
<p class="follow"><a id="p9"/> <em>Of course, the social interaction surrounding pinchos is as important as the food. We Basques greatly enjoy meeting friends before lunch or dinner for a small glass of wine and a few pinchos. It is a time when we can discuss the latest soccer game, a new love affair, or, of course, a recipe. And when a delicious little morsel accompanies our conversation, so much the better!</em></p>
<p class="follow"><em>The pinchos I present here are traditional ones, authentic combinations of foods such as hard-cooked eggs, shrimp, anchovies, olives, ham, asparagus, and mushrooms. No matter how simple the preparation, we use fresh, delicious ingredients when we assemble pinchos. And it is not only barkeeps who assemble them. Many home cooks serve pinchos at parties and casual gatherings. They are easy to make and look pretty and inviting on a tray. The innovative chefs working in</em> nueva cocina <em>restaurants in the Basque Country may be taking pinchos to new heights with exotic combinations of foods and spectacular presentations, but I think the simple ones collected here are excellent samples of these tiny treasures.</em></p>
