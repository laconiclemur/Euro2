<p class="first">Lentils are included in many Basque dishes, particularly those served during the cold months. When I was growing up, we spent nine months of the year in the capital city of Bilbao, where my six brothers and sisters and I filled the house with noisy activity. As was the custom then, we had domestic help and also a live-in German instructor, which meant that my parents' household included eleven or twelve persons. The pots and pans in our kitchen were not much smaller than those I have in the restaurants today, and got nearly as much use. Rich, warming soups such as this one were often cooking on the stove.</p>

<li>Put the lentils into a medium flame-proof casserole or other pot, cover them with about 4 cups water, and soak them for about 8 hours.</li>
<li>Drain the lentils, and return them to the casserole. Add enough cold water to cover them by 2 to 3 inches. Bring the lentils and water to a boil over medium-high heat, reduce the heat to low, and add the chorizo sausages and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Cook the lentils over very low heat for 1 hour.</li>
<li>Add the potatoes, carrots, and green and red peppers, and cook for about 20 minutes longer, until the vegetables are fork-tender.</li>
<li>In a small skillet, heat the remaining ¼ cup olive oil over medium heat, and cook the onion for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring, until it is softened. Add the onion and oil to the soup, mix well, and cook for about 10 minutes, until the flavors blend. Cut each chorizo in half, and serve 1 piece to a bowl. Season to taste with salt, and serve.</li>
