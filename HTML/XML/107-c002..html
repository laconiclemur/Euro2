<p class="first">Nobody likes croquettes more than Basquesdo. We often eat these tasty little morsels before lunch or dinner with a glass of wine, and sometimes we serve them at a cocktail party or as a light meal; children, especially, like them for supper. I have made this master recipe with salt cod, because it is so popular in the Basque Country, but you can substitute the same amount of chopped ham, chicken or turkey, beef, or chorizo sausage meat for the salt cod (making croquettes is a terrific way to use scraps and leftovers from other dishes). Sometimes we make a variety of croquettes and form them into slightly different shapes so that our guests know that one is different from the others.</p>

<li>In a shallow bowl, cover the fish with cold water. Refrigerate the fish for 24 to 36 hours, changing the water every 8 hours or so. Drain the fish on paper towels, and finely shred it with your fingers.</li>
<li>In a skillet, heat ¼ cup of the oil over medium heat. Add the salt cod, and sauté it for about 3 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons of the flour, mix well, and sauté for about 2 minutes, until the flour is blended with the cod.</li>
<li>In a small saucepan, warm the milk; this makes it easier to blend with the other ingredients. Add 1 cup of the milk to the skillet (keep the remaining ½ cup of milk warm), and mix well to blend the milk with the flour and cod. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook the mixture, stirring, for about 10 minutes, until it is well blended and hot.</li>
<li><a id="p13"/> Add the remaining ½ cup of milk to the pan, and cook the mixture for about 10 minutes longer, stirring constantly, until it is quite tender. Season it to taste with salt, if needed.</li>
<li>Transfer the contents of the pan to a shallow 8-inch-square dish or an oval dish of about the same volume. Spread the mixture evenly. Refrigerate the dish for several hours or overnight, until the mixture is chilled and firm but malleable.</li>
<li>Spread the remaining 2 tablespoons of flour on a plate. Put the beaten egg in a shallow bowl. Spread the bread crumbs on a separate plate.</li>
<li>With slightly dampened hands, form the cod mixture into walnut-sized balls. Roll each one in flour, dip it in the egg, and then roll it in the bread crumbs to coat it all over. Set each finished ball aside on a wax paper-lined tray. Refrigerate the balls to firm them for at least 15 minutes and as long as several hours.</li>
<li>When you're ready to cook the balls, heat 1 to 2 inches of olive oil in a deep skillet. Add four or five croquettes to the hot oil, and cook them, turning them often, for about 1 minute, until they are golden brown. Using a slotted spoon, gently lift the croquettes from the pan, and drain them on paper towels. Continue frying the rest of the croquettes, letting the oil regain its heat between batches. Serve immediately, while they're still hot.</li>
