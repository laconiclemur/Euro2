<p class="first">This is a Basque caserío, or "farmhouse," recipe. Whenever I return to the Basque Country, I buy dried red choricero peppers from Felisa Madariaga, who lives on a beautiful farm near Bilbao. She is so generous (and proud that my New York customers enjoy her peppers) that she always treats me to special dishes, often chorizo sausages and freshly cooked <em>talo. Talo</em> are similar to Mexican tortillas, but they are a little thicker and more forgiving to make. In the old days, shepherds often carried talo, wrapped around cold meat or some leftover vegetables, into the pastures. Today talo are more often wrapped around sausages. When they are accompanied by a glass of red wine on a cold winter's night, you cannot hope for more!</p>

<li>In a large bowl, whisk together the cornmeal and salt. Mound the mixture in the bowl, then make a well in the center of the mound. Pour the hot water into the well. Using your fingers and working outward from the well, mix to make a soft dough that does not stick to your fingers.</li>
<li>On a work surface lightly dusted with cornmeal or flour, roll the dough to a thickness of ¼ inch. Using a large biscuit cutter or a small sharp knife, cut out 4-inch rounds.</li>
<li>Pour into a skillet just enough oil to coat the bottom. Heat the skillet over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium. Cook the cornmeal rounds for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, until they are golden brown. Drain them on paper towels, and serve them hot or warm.</li>
