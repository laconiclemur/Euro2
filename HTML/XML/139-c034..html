<p class="first">A delight for vegetarians, these burgers can be eaten alone as a light meal or served as a side dish as well as for a first course. We Basques usually have them as part of a more elaborate dish, Vegetable Medley (<a href="c030.xml#p54">[&gt;]</a>). I don't know who first thought of making lettuce patties, but my mother has been making them all my life, and they are lovely.</p>

<li>Remove the thick parts at the base of each lettuce leaf, and chop the remainder of the leaves. In a large saucepan, bring about 2 quarts of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the lettuce, reduce the heat to medium, and cook the lettuce for about 5 minutes, until it is soft. Drain it until it is nearly dry. Using your fingers, form the lettuce pieces into small balls.</li>
<li>Spread the flour on a plate and roll the lettuce balls in the flour, pressing them against the plate to flatten them into patties about 2 inches in diameter. Put the eggs into a shallow bowl.</li>
<li>In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium.</li>
<li>Dip the lettuce patties in the egg, drop them into the oil, and cook them for about 1 minute. Raise the heat to medium-high, turn the patties, and cook them for about 1 minute longer. Drain them on two layers of paper towels, and serve immediately.</li>
