<p class="first">To choose my favorite fish would be a very tough decision, but my choice would probably be turbot. Considered "king of the flatfishes," turbot is priced accordingly high (if you see turbot priced lower than sole, avoid it; most likely it isn't really turbot). Turbot are larger and rounder than sole with somewhat rough, brownish-grey skin on the upper part and smooth, nearly white skin on the underside. Although they can grow to 40 pounds, turbot are usually sold at 2 to 8 pounds. I suggest buying 4-pound turbot for the sweetest, whitest, firmest meat.</p>
<p class="follow">Because turbot is so delicious, I don't like to mask its flavor with any kind of sauce. Try it cooked in a very hot pan, as I describe here. It's important to raise and lower the heat as instructed to insure properly cooked fish.</p>

<li>In a shallow dish, gently whisk together the ¾ cup olive oil, the juice of one lemon, and the salt.</li>
<li>Set one large or two medium skillets over high heat, and heat them until they are very hot.</li>
<li>Dip the fillets in the oil mixture, and lay them in the pan, skin side up. Sear them for 1 minute. Reduce the heat to medium-high, and cook the fillets for 2 minutes longer. Raise the heat to high, carefully turn the fillets with a flat spatula, and cook them for 1 minute. Reduce the heat to medium, and cook the fillets for 2 minutes more.</li>
<li>Serve the fillets immediately on heated plates, with a little lemon juice and olive oil sprinkled over them. </li>

<blockquote><p class="left"><b>N<span style="font-size: smaller">OTE</span>:</b> <em>Skinning and filleting flatfish is difficult. Unless you are experienced at it, ask the fishmonger to fillet the turbot for you, leaving the skin in place. Two of the fillets will have the rougher top skin attached, and two will have the smooth, light underside skin.</em></p></blockquote>
