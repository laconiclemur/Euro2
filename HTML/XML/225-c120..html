<p class="first">When time is short, canned beef broth or even bouillon cubes are usually adequate, but make your own beef broth when you can. Doing so is inexpensive and easy—all you need is time. This broth recipe may be a little different from others you have seen, since it calls for chickpeas and marrow bones. These ingredients, common in the Basque Country, add robust flavor to the broth.</p>

<li>Rinse the beef shank and bones under running hot water, and put them into a deep stockpot. Add the onion, carrots, leeks, parsley, chickpeas, and about 2 gallons (8 quarts) of water. Bring the contents to a boil over high heat. Skim any foam that rises to the surface, reduce the heat to medium, and simmer for about 3 hours, uncovered, until the liquid is reduced by about half. During the simmering, occasionally skim any surface foam.</li>
<li>Strain the broth into another pot, discarding the bones and the vegetables. (You may want to use the meat from the beef shank to prepare Croquettes; see <a href="c002.xml#p12">[&gt;]</a>). Season the broth to taste with salt. Immediately plunge the pot containing the broth into a bowl or sink filled with ice cubes and cold water, and let the broth cool. Refrigerate or freeze the broth in covered containers until you are ready to use it. The broth will keep for up to 3 days in the refrigerator or for up to 1 month in the freezer.</li>

Marrow bones are usually leg bones. Both knucklebones and marrow bones are often available at supermarkets as well as butcher shops.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="follow"><em>After straining the broth, you can discard the bone marrow along with the bones, but I like it spread on bread or toast with a sprinkling of salt.</em></p></blockquote>
