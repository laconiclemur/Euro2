<p class="first">In Bilbao—and indeed throughout the Basque Country—pork loin is often sold already rubbed with a red, paste-like marinade. My mother never marinated her own pork loin; instead, like every other cook in the city, she bought the pork from the butcher already marinated. She then sliced and pan-fried it for us. When I arrived in New York, I could not find pork prepared this way and so set about discovering what was in the marinade. After some trial and error, I arrived at the right proportions of garlic, oil, and paprika—and was excited at the result. This dish tastes like home to me.</p>
<p class="follow"><a id="p113"/> Because pork loin is rarely sold in pieces as small as 2 pounds, make this dish with meat left over from Top Loin of Pork Cooked with Milk (<a href="c069.xml#p115">[&gt;]</a>) or any other pork loin dish.</p>

<li>To prepare the marinade, mash the garlic in a mortar with a little salt. Add the olive oil and paprika, and mix until the paste is intensely red.</li>
<li>Rub the loin with the paste, and then seal the loin in plastic wrap or a plastic bag. Refrigerate the meat for 2 to 4 days.</li>
<li>To cook the pork, remove the loin from the plastic bag, and slice it crosswise ½ inch thick.</li>
<li>In a large skillet, heat the oil over high heat. Add as many pork slices as will fit in the pan without crowding, and sear them for 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce the heat, turn the pork slices, and cook them for about 3 minutes longer on each side, until the meat is cooked through. Remove the cooked slices from the pan, and cook the remaining slices in the same way, adding more oil if necessary. Serve the meat with sliced roasted red peppers.</li>

<h4 class="boxtitle"><a id="p114"/> Sidrerías, Basque Cider Houses</h4>
<p class="first"><em>I know of nothing</em> that resembles Basque <em>sidrerías.</em> If you happen to visit my homeland, do not pass up any opportunity to visit one of these informal and lovely cider houses, where a simple but tasty meal can be had for a fixed price of about 25 dollars. My favorite <em>sidrería,</em> named Zapiain, is one of the oldest, and it is only a few miles away from San Sebastián (Donostia).</p>
<p class="follow"><em>Sidrerías</em> are rustic warehouses where natural cider is stored in huge barrels, called <em>kupelas.</em> In the front section of each warehouse are oversized charcoal-fired grills and long communal tables where guests stand to eat the limited fare. In fact, the menu of all <em>sidrerías</em> is the same—salt-cod omelet, salt cod with peppers, gigantic T-bone steaks to share, and, for dessert, quince jam and walnuts.</p>
<p class="follow">The fun begins when a guest decides to call out the word "<em>Mojón!</em>" At the call, thirsty guests surge toward the cider barrels, glasses in hand. The barrel tenders remove the small wooden plugs called <em>txotx</em> from the <em>kupelas,</em> and guests line up to shove their glasses under the stream, called <em>txiri,</em> of lightly fermented cider. Afterwards, it's back to the T-bones and omelets until the next customer cries out, "<em>Mojón!</em>" and the rush to the barrels is on again. Needless to say, this is a lusty and boisterous dining experience—and one that typifies the Basques' appreciation of lively good times and well-prepared, simple food and drink.</p>
