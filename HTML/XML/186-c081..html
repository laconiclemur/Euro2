<p class="first">I learned to roast chicken in this simple yet delicious method from a dear friend who otherwise could not cook at all. She was our neighbor during summers in Mundaka, and we children always turned up at her door when she roasted a plump chicken. Over the years, everyone who has tried this recipe has been very pleased with it. I always try to cook with free-range, farm-raised chickens—which I call happy hens. They are more expensive than other fowl, but their flavor is far superior. I love this dish preceded by a green salad and served with Basque Fries (<a href="c123.xml#p198">[&gt;]</a>). My youngest sons, Alex and Lucas, say this is "the best chicken in the world."</p>

<li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Sprinkle the chicken with salt inside and out. Insert one bouillon cube into the chicken's cavity. Using a sharp knife, trim off the ends of the lemon, and make a few deep incisions in the lemon. Put the lemon into the breast cavity, and then insert the other bouillon cube.</li>
<li>Rub the chicken with lard or oil, and set it, breast up, in a roasting pan. Roast the chicken for 8 minutes, then turn it breast down and baste it. After 8 minutes more, turn it breast-side up and baste it again. Continue turning and basting the chicken about every 8 minutes until it has roasted for 1 hour.</li>
<li>After 1 hour, increase the oven temperature to 450°F, and add the beer, if you're using it. Roast the chicken 15 minutes more, until it is crisp and golden.</li>
<li>Lift the chicken from the pan, and set it on a platter. Put the pan on a burner, and add the water. Cook the juices over high heat, stirring, until they are boiling and blended. Serve the pan juices with the carved chicken.</li>
