<p class="noindentb">The seafood for this recipe may be prepared one day in advance. Toss it with the remaining ingredients one or two hours before serving. If your fishmonger cannot get fresh octopus, simply increase the amounts of calamari and shrimp.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">6 to 8 cups baby lettuce</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> To poach the seafood, you will need a large saucepan fitted with a colander insert. In the bottom of the pan, combine the celery, carrot, onion, bay leaf, lemon juice, salt, and water. Bring to a boil.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_38"/><span class="red">2.</span> Place the calamari in the colander and cook in the boiling water for 2 minutes. Remove from the water, transfer to a large bowl, and set aside. Place the scallops in the colander and cook in the boiling water for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the water and transfer to the bowl with the calamari (large sea scallops may be cut in half horizontally after cooking; bay scallops may be left whole). Place the shrimp in the colander and cook in the boiling water until pink, about 3 minutes. Remove from the water. Peel, devein, and cut in half horizontally, adding them to the bowl with the calamari and scallops.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Remove the colander from the pan and place the octopus directly in the saucepan, adding more water if necessary to completely cover. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and gently simmer until you can easily push your finger through one of the thickest portions of the tentacles, 40 to 50 minutes. Transfer the octopus to a bowl and place under cold running water until cooled, about 5 minutes. Use your fingers and a small paring knife to remove the outer skin. Discard the hard mouth and the head sac. Cut the tentacles on the bias into 1-inch pieces and add to the bowl with the other seafood.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> To prepare the salad, toss the julienned celery, carrots, bell peppers, scallion, parsley, basil, and garlic in a serving bowl. Add the seafood and toss. Add the lemon juice, vinegar, and olive oil, and toss well. Season with the salt and generous grindings of pepper. Arrange 1 cup of lettuce on each serving plate. Top with equal portions of the seafood-and-vegetable mixture, and serve immediately.</p>

And although it isn’t traditional, a hint of cilantro goes very well with this dish—2 teaspoons chopped should do it.</p>
