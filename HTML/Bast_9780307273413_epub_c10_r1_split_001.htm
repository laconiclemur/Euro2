I did take a quick visit to Basilicata during one of my research trips to Puglia. I had gone to Altamura in search of the best bread in Italy, as claimed, when Franco came to meet me and swept me across the regional border into Basilicata. Matera was the first city where we stopped, and I knew then and there that this was a special place, a place somewhat forgotten, but once you crossed its borders there was no letting go. That visit led to many subsequent trips to this place of mystical landscapes and very special people—people who want you to love their land and the intense flavors of their foods.</p>

  <p class="indent">My friend Franco had returned with his wife to live in San Martino d’Agri, in the middle of Basilicata, where he was born. Franco is a wine merchant who has made his home in the United States with his family for more than fifteen years, but the call of his Lucania was too compelling, so he returned to Italy to settle in Rome—close enough, since San Martino d’Agri is only four hours away.</p>

  <p class="indent">With Franco, I explored the food bounty of this little-known and sparsely populated region. The fare is pasta, vegetables, mountain cheeses such as pecorino and provola, and lamb and pork, plus a taste of fish in the coastal towns. But within this seemingly limited list there was a world of flavors to discover. Durum-wheat pasta, dry or freshly made, reigns; Bucatini with Sausage, Pasta with Baked Cherry Tomatoes, Ditalini with <em class="calibre4">Broccoli di Rape</em>, Rigatoni with Lentils, and Fiery <em class="calibre4">Maccheroni</em> are just some of what I discovered and want to share with you.</p>

  <p class="indent">One Sunday, Franco’s sister Angela was unstoppable as she made for us <em class="calibre4">ferricelli</em>, fresh pasta, which she rolled on a knitting needle and dressed with a sausage sauce; then <em class="calibre4">lasagnelle</em>, which she dressed with Sarconi beans and tomato. With her two forefingers she dragged the dough on a board to create <em class="calibre4">raschiatelli</em>, which looked like larger cavatelli, and she dressed them with <em class="calibre4">broccoli di rape.</em> The Sarconi beans, from the town of the same name, were especially memorable. These tender, meaty, plump white beans resembling canellini turned the <em class="calibre4">lasagnelle</em> dish into a rare treat. What was ever present in each one of these dishes was the <em class="calibre4">diavollicchio</em>, the local chili pepper, used mostly in powdered form. The best of these peppers come from Senise, a small <a class="calibre8" id="page294"></a>town in the center of Basilicata, next to the Lago di Monte Cotugno. The classic appetizer here is the <em class="calibre4">Zafaran crusck.</em> And what would that be? Well, it’s like a chip made with thin-skinned, tender peppers from Senise. First they are air-dried, then popped into hot oil to crisp, and they are eaten as a snack.</p>

  <p class="indent">What I found amazing is that a sprinkle of the chili powder changed an otherwise mundane dish, such as boiled potatoes, into something festive. But also try tossing some fried fresh Senise peppers with boiled potatoes and you’ll have another flavor revelation.</p>

  <p class="indent">Even Franco got into the kitchen with his sister that Sunday during my visit, and showed me his favorite dish. He quickly sliced an abundant amount of garlic, let it cook in extra-virgin olive oil until golden, then turned off the heat and sprinkled one heaping teaspoon of the peperoncino powder into the hot oil, exclaiming, <em class="calibre4">“Alla Zift.”</em> Now there is no such word in Italian, but he kept repeating it—<em class="calibre4">Zift, Zift</em>—and I realized it was the sound that the pepper makes when it hits the hot oil. He dressed a pound of cooked pasta with that, and behold, the most delicious three-ingredient recipe I have ever tasted.</p>

  <p class="indent">The condiment of choice in Basilicata is some form of fresh or cured pork, and <em class="calibre4">luganighe</em>, the sausages of the Lucani, are the front-runner. In a land where summers are hot and meat is scarce, the best way to preserve it is to make it into sausages or salamis, add some herbs and peperoncino to keep those nasty bacteria away, and you have flavoring for pasta and soups for the whole year. One of my favorite soups from Basilicata is Wedding Soup—<em class="calibre4">Minestra Maritata</em>, with mixed vegetables, little meatballs, and cubes of provola cheese.</p>

  <p class="indent">There is great olive oil produced in Basilicata, and the renowned wine is Aglianico del Volture, a full-bodied red from the primitive varietals of which Paternoster is a very good producer. But on one early morning we headed out to visit Azienda Agricola Gli Angeli di Crocco in Montalbano Jonico, where we had some excellent Malvasia and a plateful of extraordinary just-picked figs. Azienda Crocco, run by a father-and-son team, is perched on a hill surrounded by a multitude of the most fascinating and beautiful dry clay formations, called <em class="calibre4">calanchi.</em> These <em class="calibre4">calanchi</em> make up the sides of the surrounding hills, which seem like drapes flowing in the wind, and extend serpentlike for miles, resembling the Great Wall of China. An amazing sight, but, then, this is the <em class="calibre4">terroir</em> from which Matera, the dwelling in stone also known as I Sassi, was formed.</p>

  <p class="indent">The wines from the hills of Basilicata were long traded for the <em class="calibre4">baccalà</em> of the Nordic waters. As in most of Italy, <em class="calibre4">baccalà</em> has found its way, along with <em class="calibre4">Zuppa di Pesce</em>, onto the seafood menus of Basilicata, especially on the seacoast around Maratea, a beautiful summer resort.</p>

  <p class="indent">For one of the smallest, least populated, and least known regions of Italy, Basilicata has a lot on its table, and there is no more faithful son than Franco Luisi singing its much-deserved praises.</p>

  <p class="nonindent1">Minestra Maritata <img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Makes about 5 quarts</p>

  <p class="extract">In the dialect of the Lucani (as natives of Basilicata are known) <em class="calibre4">maritare</em> means “to wed,” and I have always thought that this wonderful soup was so named because it was customarily served at wedding celebrations. Recently, however, while doing some research, I came upon another explanation of why it is called <em class="calibre4">maritata</em>—because it weds vegetables (in the soup base) with meat (in the <em class="calibre4">polpette</em>), and with this added protein it becomes a complete and balanced one-course meal. I like both interpretations of the name and believe they’re compatible. Certainly a young couple, on the brink of their first night as newlyweds, can use this fortifying nourishment!</p>

  <p class="indent">There are many ways to prepare and serve a soup with multiple elements like this one, and you can of course play around with the recipe here. One variation is to fry the meatballs rather than poaching them. Though it takes a bit more work, it does give another layer of flavor (see my recipe for Meatballs in Broth in the Umbria chapter, for instructions on frying little meatballs for soup). Another option is to add cubes of provola to the soup just before serving. If you can get a good-quality Italian provola (mild provolone), this embellishment is superb. I’ve included instructions for this step at the end of the main recipe.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page297"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Using the food processor, mince the onion, celery, carrot, garlic, and basil into a smooth paste <em class="calibre4">(pestata).</em></p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Heat the olive oil in the soup pot over high heat, and scrape in the <em class="calibre4">pestata.</em> Cook, stirring, until the <em class="calibre4">pestata</em> has dried out and just begins to stick to the bottom of the pan, about 5 minutes. Pour the cold water into the pot, stir up the <em class="calibre4">pestata</em>, put on the cover, and bring the water to a boil. Lower the heat, and simmer the broth for about 15 minutes, blending the flavors, then stir in the greens, the fennel, the zucchini, and the 2 tablespoons salt. Return to the simmer, and cook covered for 45 minutes or so, until the greens are tender. Remove the cover, and cook at an active simmer for another 45 minutes or longer, until the soup has reduced in volume and the flavors are concentrated to your taste.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> While the soup simmers, prepare the meatballs. Tear the bread into chunks, put them in a small bowl, and pour in just enough milk to cover them. Let soak for a few minutes, until completely saturated, then lift the bread out of the bowl and squeeze out the milk in your fists (use the milk for another purpose). Tear the moistened bread into shreds, and toss them into a large bowl.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Remove the sausage meat from the casing, and crumble it in with the shredded bread, breaking up any meat clumps with your fingers. Pour the beaten egg over the meat, and sprinkle the salt, freshly ground black pepper, and parsley on top. Fold and toss and squeeze all the ingredients through your fingers to distribute them evenly. Scoop up a small amount of the meat mix—about a heaping teaspoon—and roll it in your palms to form a 1-inch ball (the size of a large grape). Continue to form balls until all the meat is used up.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Meanwhile, fill the 4-quart saucepan with 3 quarts of lightly salted water to poach the meatballs, and bring it to a boil. Drop in the meatballs, cover the pot, and return the water to a boil quickly. Adjust the heat to keep the water simmering gently, and poach the meatballs, uncovered, about 5 minutes, until cooked through. Lift them out with a spider or strainer, let drain briefly, and drop them into the finished soup (discard the poaching water).</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Bring the soup to a simmer, and cook meatballs and soup together for about 5 minutes. (If you’ll be serving the soup later, put the meatballs in a bowl. Reheat them in the soup, and simmer 5 minutes just before serving.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Turn off the heat, and ladle the soup, with plenty of vegetables and meatballs, into warm bowls. Sprinkle each serving with some of the grated cheese, and give it a drizzle of your best olive oil. Serve right away, passing more cheese at the table.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> If you are adding provola to the soup, as I like to do, drop in the cubes just after the meatballs have simmered in it and you’ve turned off the heat. Give the soup one good stir to distribute the provola pieces, which will begin to melt right away, and immediately ladle individual portions into your warm bowls. (Don’t leave the provola in the soup pot for a long time before serving, because it will become stringy.)</p>

  <p class="extract">Potatoes will never taste the same after you have tried this dish. This preparation captures the beauty of the cooking of Basilicata: straightforward, simple, but full of brilliant flavor. Even if you are not so passionate about hot pepper, I encourage you not to be timid with the peperoncino in this dish.</p>

  <p class="indent">Of course, this kind of simple cooking depends on fine ingredients. Excellent olive oil and good potatoes are key. I like russets, but Yukon Gold or waxy varieties would work, too.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Put the peperoncino flakes in the spice grinder or mortar and pestle, and grind to a fine powder.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Put the potatoes in the 4-quart pot with water to cover them by about 2 inches, and bring to a boil. Cook just until the potatoes are easily pierced with a fork or sharp knife blade (don’t let them get mushy), then drain and let them cool. Peel off the skins, and cut the potatoes crosswise into round slices, about ⅓ inch thick. Put the slices in a large warmed serving bowl, sprinkle the salt over them, and toss well to season. Cover the bowl with a cloth kitchen towel to keep them warm.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the dressing: Pour the olive oil in the skillet, and set over medium heat for a couple of minutes. Strew the sliced garlic and sprinkle the ground peperoncino in the hot oil, and let both sizzle, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the heat, and stir in the chopped parsley. Drizzle the seasoned oil from the skillet over the warm potatoes, and toss to coat all the slices. Serve immediately.</p>

  <p class="extract">The trio of seasonal vegetables here lends a distinctive flavor and texture to this skillet-cooked vegetable dish. Crisp and soft at the same time, it is a deluxe version of home fries, with the artichokes and favas adding color and excitement to the familiar flavor of pan-fried potatoes. It’s a great dinner vegetable dish, as well as a terrific accompaniment to eggs at a springtime breakfast or brunch. (If you are watching your carbs, omit the potatoes and increase the amounts of other vegetables by half.)</p>

Drain the beans, and drop them right away into a large bowl of ice water. When chilled, drain the favas again; peel off (and discard) the inner skins. You should have about 2 cups peeled favas.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To prepare the artichokes: Fill a large bowl with a couple of quarts of cold water, and squeeze in the juice of the lemon, dropping in the cut lemon halves, too. Snap off the thick outside artichoke leaves; cut off the top third of the remaining leaf tips, and trim the stem tip. Peel the globe of the artichoke, removing the stubs of the plucked leaves and the skin covering the stem, to expose the lighter-colored tender flesh. Slice the artichoke in half lengthwise, and scrape out the choke (if present) with a paring knife or the edge of a teaspoon. Slice the artichoke halves into 1-inch-thick wedges, and drop them into the bowl of acidulated water.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour 4 tablespoons of the olive oil into the big skillet, set it over medium heat, and scatter in the pancetta pieces. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, as they render fat, then stir in the onion slices, sprinkle in the peperoncino, and cook another 4 minutes or so, until the onions are sizzling and wilting. Drain the artichoke wedges and spread them in the pan; stir and toss gently to coat them with oil. Cover the skillet, and cook for about 15 minutes, until the artichokes are tender, stirring now and then.</p>

Cover and cook for 10 minutes or so, stirring and turning the vegetables over gently so the potatoes don’t break apart too much. If they’re sticking to the bottom of the skillet, loosen with a few tablespoons of water, scrape them up, and turn them over. If there’s liquid in the pan, remove the cover and cook it away over slightly higher heat. When the potatoes start to brown, sprinkle on the salt, and drizzle the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil all over.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Cook, uncovered, for another 5 to 10 minutes, occasionally lifting and tumbling the vegetables over with the spatula. As you do, scrape up the crusty glaze that forms on the skillet bottom, and turn it with the vegetables, to incorporate the crustiness throughout. When everything is golden and lightly crusted, turn off the heat. Serve the <em class="calibre4">ciaudedda</em> family-style while still hot, right from the skillet.</p>

  <p class="nonindent1">Bucatini con Salsicce <img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Makes about 7 cups, enough for 2 pounds of bucatini or other pasta, serving 12</p>

  <p class="extract">This recipe makes a wonderful tomato-and-sausage sauce for pasta. Typical of Basilicata, it is uncomplicated yet yields a complex and delicious flavor. It is important to use the best sausage, preferably a mix freshly made by a real Italian butcher. If there’s one available to you, ask for sweet, all-pork sausage, preferably a medium grind of meat with some texture, rather than a fine grind, which tends to be pasty. To save work, since you want the meat to be loose, ask for the sausage mix before it is put in the casing. As for the pasta, I recommend bucatini, which is what I first had in Basilicata. But I like spaghetti with this, too—a whole-wheat spaghetti would be especially nice.</p>

Break it up with your fingers into the smallest possible bits, pour the white wine over it, and toss the crumbled meat until it’s evenly moistened. Remove the stems of the drained peperoncini, scrape out the seeds (or leave some, if you like it hot), and slice the peppers crosswise into ¼-inch rings.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour the olive oil into the skillet, and set it over medium heat. Scatter in the sliced garlic, and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 3 minutes. Toss the sausage meat into the skillet, and spread it out, breaking apart any clumps, and stirring with the oil and garlic. Raise the heat a bit, and cook for 5 minutes or so, stirring now and then, as the meat juices bubble and evaporate. When the pan is dry and the sausage starts sizzling, season it with the salt, and scatter the peperoncini slices in the pan. Stir and cook for a minute or two, until the peppers are sizzling, too.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour in the crushed tomatoes and 3 cups of water (with which you sloshed out the tomato containers), and stir well. Cover the pan, bring the liquid to a boil over high heat, then set the cover ajar and adjust the heat to keep a steady bubbling boil. Cook for an hour or so, until the sauce has reduced by nearly half, stirring more frequently as it thickens; if it is still loose, cook uncovered for a few minutes more. When the sauce has a consistency you like for dressing pasta, turn off the heat. You can use some of the sauce right away—you’ll need half of it to dress a pound of bucatini—or let it cool (then refrigerate or freeze) for later use.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> For the pasta: Fill the large pot with salted water (at least 6 quarts water with 1 tablespoon salt), and heat to a rolling boil. Drop in the bucatini, stirring and separating the strands. Cover the pot, return the water to a boil over high heat, then set the cover ajar and cook the pasta until barely <em class="calibre4">al dente.</em> Meanwhile, heat half the sausage sauce in the big skillet back to a bare simmer; if it has cooled and thickened, loosen it with some of the pasta water.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When done, lift the bucatini from the pot, let drain for a moment, and drop it into the sauce.

  <p class="extract">The deep flavor and delightfully varied textures of this pasta dressing develop in the oven, where you bake the cherry tomatoes coated with bread crumbs just before you toss them with pasta. Roasting them this way intensifies their flavor, and the bread crumbs become crunchy. It is a lovely dish to make when sweet cherry tomatoes are in season, but it is also good with the lesser cherry-tomato varieties you get in winter; these can be used successfully here because of the concentration of taste and texture during baking.</p>

  <p class="indent">This dressing is suitable for almost any pasta, but I particularly like it with spaghetti, gemelli, or penne. Because the tomatoes are at their best as soon as they come out of the oven, the dressing and pasta should be cooked simultaneously, and I have written the recipe to ensure that you will have your pasta and baked tomatoes ready for each other at the same time.</p>

First, slice off the bottom of the stem with a paring knife—just the dried part, where the stem was first cut, usually no more than an inch or so. With the blade of the knife, lift the outer skin of the stem, starting at your fresh bottom cut, and peel it toward the top in one long strip. Pull off the large, tough leaves attached to the lower stem, too. Peel away more strips of skin (and lower leaves) until only the pale inner stem remains, with all the tender leaves and <em class="calibre4">broccoli di rape</em> florets at the top.

  <p class="extract">Like many traditional Lucani dishes, this one is fashioned from the handful of ingredients one would find even in the most humble peasant pantry: dried peppers, yesterday’s bread, a chunk of hard cheese, olive oil, and garlic. Minimal yet delicious.</p>

  <p class="indent">The fire in fiery <em class="calibre4">maccheroni</em>, of course, comes from dried <em class="calibre4">diavolicchio</em>, the hot chili peppers so beloved in Basilicata and other southern regions. Here, whole dried peperoncino pods are soaked until soft, then puréed into a pesto to dress the pasta. Toasted bread crumbs play an important role in this dish, too, when they’re tossed in just before serving. They pick up the paste and garlicky olive oil, cling to the strands of pasta (preferably bucatini or perciatelli), and give crunchy, fiery sparks of flavor to every enjoyable bite.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To soften the peperoncini: Remove the stems, put them in a heatproof bowl or measuring cup, and pour over them 2 cups of boiling water. Let them soak for several hours (preferably overnight), until they are very pliable.</p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page309"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the pepper pesto: Drain the peperoncini (discard the soaking water), and put them in the bowl of the food processor with 6 tablespoons of the olive oil. Process to a smooth paste (though you may see a few seeds), scraping down the sides several times. If you are not using the pesto right away, pack it into a small container, smooth the top, and cover the pesto with a thin film of olive oil (a little will go a long way).</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To toast the bread crumbs: Spread them on a rimmed baking sheet and place it in a 350° oven.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When you are ready to cook the pasta, fill the large pot with water and 1 tablespoon salt, and heat to a rolling boil.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> As soon as the bucatini goes in the pot, pour the remaining olive oil into the big skillet, and set it over medium-high heat. Scatter in the sliced garlic, and cook for a minute or so, until it’s sizzling, then scrape in the pepper pesto, spread it over the pan bottom, and let it toast for a minute. Ladle in about 2 cups of the boiling pasta water, sprinkle in the 1 teaspoon salt and chopped parsley, and stir well. Bring the water to a boil, and cook until half of it evaporates, about 3 minutes, then lower the heat to keep the sauce barely simmering.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When the bucatini is <em class="calibre4">al dente</em>, lift it from the pot, let drain for a moment, and drop it into the skillet.

  <p class="extract">In the coastal areas of Basilicata, the varied catch of the day is the basis of this uncomplicated yet very tasty fish soup. Here I recommend using monkfish and grouper fillets, both with firm texture, so they won’t fall apart in the <em class="calibre4">zuppa.</em> Halibut is another good choice. Indeed, many varieties of fish and shellfish can be prepared this way, as long as you adjust the cooking time so the flesh remains intact and avoid overcooking. If using clams or mussels, use a wider pot, so the shells do not break the meaty fish as they open.</p>

Quickly lay the fish pieces in the pan in a single layer, shaking off any loose flour before they go in, and placing the grouper pieces skin side down. Leave as much space as possible between the pieces. Without moving the pieces, fry the fish on the first side for about 2 minutes, until a light crust forms.

To decide if <em class="calibre4">Baccalà</em> has been soaked sufficiently, press a finger against it at a thick part, and touch it to the tongue. If it’s palatably salty, it is ready to be cooked. Drain the <em class="calibre4">baccalù</em>, pat dry, and cook right away or store in the refrigerator, well wrapped, and cook within a day or so.</p>

Lay the codfish pieces in the pan in a single layer, and fry for about 5 minutes, until the underside is colored, then flip the pieces over. Scatter the sliced garlic and the peperoncino over the pan bottom, in between the fish pieces. Cook for several minutes, to brown the second side, then turn them all over again.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Nestle the roasted-pepper pieces in between the fish pieces, to start cooking on the pan bottom.

Shake the pan to distribute the liquids evenly throughout, and bring them to a simmer. Cook for about 8 minutes, or until the fish is done to your liking.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To poach the prunes: Cut them into bite-sized morsels. Put them in a small saucepan with ⅓ cup of the sugar, the lemon zest, and the wine. Set the pan over medium-low heat, and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar. Let the syrup bubble gently and steadily for 15 minutes or so, reducing slowly, until it has thickened and barely covers the shiny poached prunes. Leave the prunes in the syrup to cool completely, then drain through a sieve, collecting and saving the remaining syrup, about ¼ cup. (You can poach the prunes hours or a day ahead of time and leave them soaking in the syrup. Drain well before assembling the cake.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the cake: Arrange a rack in the center of the oven, and heat to 350°. Secure the bottom disk in the springform, and grease the inside surfaces with a tablespoon of the soft butter. Stir the bread crumbs and a tablespoon of sugar together. Coat the buttered bottom and sides of the cake pan completely with the crumb mixture, and shake out any loose crumbs.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Sift together the flour, baking powder, and baking soda.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Put the remaining sugar and butter in the mixer bowl and, using the paddle attachment, cream together for several minutes on high speed, scraping down the bowl several times, until light and smooth.</p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page316"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Beat in the egg yolks one at a time; scrape down the bowl, and fluff up the batter on high speed after incorporating each yolk. On low speed, blend in the dry ingredients, mixing just until completely moistened and incorporated.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> In a clean bowl, whip the egg whites with the salt to firm peaks, using the whisk attachment or a hand whisk. Stir in a third of the whites to lighten the cake batter, then gently fold in the remainder. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan, and spread it to fill the springform in a flat, even layer.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Scatter the drained prune pieces all over the top of the batter, spaced evenly, covering the whole cake. Put the pan in the oven, and bake for about 45 minutes (rotating it after 25 minutes), as the batter rises around the prune pieces. When the top is golden brown and a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean, remove the cake to a wire cooling rack. Drizzle the remaining wine syrup all over the top of the warm cake, and let it cool for ½ hour or so before loosening and removing the side ring.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Serve the <em class="calibre4">torta</em> slightly warm or at room temperature, cut in wedges—plain or topped with whipped cream.</p>
