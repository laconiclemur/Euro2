<p class="chapterOpenerText" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">T</span></span><span class="italic">his panorama of Emilia Romagna’s desserts spans both time and distance. It does not pretend to encompass the wealth of the region’s sweets, but rather is a sampling of each area and period. Included here are 400 years of court food, beginning in the 1500s with Cardinal d’Este’s Tart and weaving through the centuries to the contemporary Frozen Hazelnut Zabaione with Chocolate Marsala Sauce. I have borrowed as well from the vast collection of sweets marking feast days and festivals. And there are home dishes, their origins ranging from mountain villages to the farms of the Po River plain. Some are country desserts still baked in the hot coals of kitchen hearths, while others were created in the modern stainless steel kitchens of city restaurants</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Desserts in Emilia-Romagna possess almost as much diversity as do her pastas. The simplest of sweets, like fresh melon with balsamic vinegar and mint, exist side by side with the unrestrained excess of a frozen mousse of espresso, mascarpone cheese, and cream. The same pastry shop may produce the homey <span class="underline">Ciambelle</span> cake and sophisticated Duchess of Parma Torte. Desserts fall into several categories. <span class="underline">Dolci</span> is the <a id="page394"/>all-inclusive term for sweets. A <span class="underline">torta</span> can be a cake, a tart, or a pudding in the shape of a cake</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">“Keeping cakes” of winter is my own phrase for the spiced cakes of Christmas, baked in autumn and mellowed until the holidays. They are part of a category of sweets meant for long storage or maturing (<span class="underline">dolci di lunga conservazione</span>). Jams, conserves, cookies, candies, grape syrup, and liqueurs all fall into this group. Spoon sweets (<span class="underline">dolci al cucchiaio</span>) are literally spoonable custards and creams. For me, fruit dishes are part of this category, as are frozen desserts</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Chestnut dishes are under yet another heading. Although there are only three, they represent rich traditions from the hills and mountains of the region. These nuts were the flour, sweetener, and substance of many sweets in the past</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">With each recipe you will find information on its traditions and ideas for serving the dish today. The menu suggestions at the end of each recipe get down to specifics, explaining how to serve the sweets with the rest of the dishes in this book</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">A Note on Pastry:</span> <span class="italic">The tarts in this chapter share a similar pastry, a butter/sugar dough called <span class="underline">pasta frolla.</span> Some tarts demand a crust with more butter or sugar, and some less. In Nonna’s Jam Tart, there is yet another possible interpretation of the pastry. The butter and sugar are whipped to a fluff with flour folded in later, creating a shortbread-style crust that is light and crisp</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Shorter, sweeter crusts may break apart as you transfer them to the tart pan. But remember, no one sees the bottom of your dessert. As long as the thickness of the crust is even for proper baking, there is nothing to worry about. Just press the pieces into the pan, joining the edges by pinching them together. These fragile crusts reward with melt-in-the-mouth tenderness</span>.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making Almond Powder:</span> Combine the almonds, 2 tablespoons confectioner’s sugar, and 3 tablespoons cocoa in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Process until the almonds are a fine powder.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Blending the Batter:</span> Butter the bottom and sides of an 8-inch springform pan with the 1 tablespoon of butter. Cut a circle of parchment paper to cover the bottom <a id="page396"/>of the pan. Butter the paper with ½ tablespoon butter and line the pan with it, butter side up. Use the 3 to 4 tablespoons flour to coat the entire interior of the springform, shaking out any excess. Preheat the oven to 375°F, and set a rack in the center of the oven. Using an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or a hand-held electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar at medium speed 8 to 10 minutes, or until almost white and very fluffy. Scrape down the sides of the bowl several times during beating. Beating the butter and sugar to absolute airiness ensures the <span class="italic">torta’s</span> fine grain and melting lightness. Still at medium speed, beat in the peanut butter. Then beat in the egg yolks, two at a time, until smooth. Reduce the speed to medium-low, and beat in the melted chocolates, the dissolved coffee, and the rum and vanilla. Then use a big spatula to fold in the almond powder by hand, keeping the batter light.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Whip the egg whites to stiff peaks. Lighten the chocolate batter by folding a quarter of the whites into it. Then fold in the rest, keeping the mixture light but without leaving any streaks of white.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Baking:</span> Turn the batter into the baking pan, gently smoothing the top. Bake 15 minutes. Then reduce the oven heat to 325°F and bake another 15 to 20 minutes, or until a tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out with a few streaks of thick batter. The cake will have puffed about two thirds of the way up the sides of the pan. Cool the cake 10 minutes in the pan set on a rack. The cake will settle slightly but will remain level. Spread a kitchen towel on a large plate, and turn the cake out onto it. Peel off the parchment paper and cool the cake completely. Then place a round cake plate on top of the cake and hold the two plates together as you flip them over so the <span class="italic">torta</span> is right side up on the cake plate.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Serving:</span> <span class="italic">Torta Barozzi</span> is moist and fudgy. Just before serving, sift the tablespoon of cocoa over the cake. Then top it with a sifting of the confectioner’s sugar. (Or for a whimsical decoration, cut a large stencil of the letter “B” out of stiff paper or cardboard. Set it in the center of the cake before dusting the entire top with the confectioner’s sugar. Carefully lift off the stencil once the sugar has settled.) Serve the <span class="italic">Barozzi</span> at room temperature, slicing it in small wedges.</p>

<div class="box"><hr/>
<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">“It’s All There on the Box”</span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Cracking the code of <span class="italic">Torta Barozzi</span> is Modena’s favorite food game. For decades local cooks have tried to unravel its mystery, without success. When a Modenese dinner party gets dull, ask about <span class="italic">Torta Barozzi</span> and settle back. The heat of the debate will warm you for the rest of the evening. Eugenio Gollini invented the cake in 1897 at his Pasticceria Gollini in Vignola. The cake commemorated the birthday of Renaissance architect Jacopo Barozzi, a native son of Vignola who invented the spiral staircase. Today Gollini’s grandsons, Carlo and Eugenio, still make <span class="italic">Barozzi</span> at the same <span class="italic">pasticceria</span>. Its recipe is secret, although its ingredients are stated on the cake’s box. Family members have sworn never to reveal nor change the formula. But Eugenio Gollini smiles serenely when he tells you it is all there in plain sight.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Gollini offered no clue of how peanuts—a startling and definitely non-Italian ingredient—became part of the cake. I speculate that late 19th-century cooks considered these nuts, brought from Africa, to be exotic and intriguing. Perhaps in experimenting with them, the elder Gollini discovered how good they are with chocolate. Then he might have found that peanuts puréed into peanut butter ensured a smoother and even more melting <span class="italic">Torta Barozzi</span> Historian Renato Bergonzini explained why the people of Vignola believe the cake’s secret eludes discovery: “Barozzi left the last step of his spiral staircase unfinished. No one knows why, and no one would presume to finish it. To imitate the <span class="italic">torta</span> is like trying to finish Barozzi’s staircase: impudent and foolish. Only the master himself can complete his work.” I confess to both impudence and foolishness, but also to success. This recipe comes tantalizingly close to the original.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Blending the Dough:</span> Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a baking sheet with the tablespoon butter, and set an oven rack in the center of the oven. Make the jam cake in the easiest and most traditional way—by hand. Put all the dry ingredients for the dough, including the lemon zest, in a shallow bowl. Blend them thoroughly with your hands or with a fork. Rub the butter into the dry ingredients, using your fingertips, until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir the egg, vanilla, and milk together. Make a well in the middle of the dry ingredients, and add the liquids. Gradually work in the dry ingredients, tossing them with a fork rather than stirring. The idea is to thoroughly moisten the dough but not beat it, as that makes it tough. Help with your hands. The dough should be lumpy, sticky, and moist.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Shaping and Filling the Dough:</span> Generously flour a work surface, and turn the dough out onto it. Lightly flour your hands. Pat the dough out to form a rectangle about 8 inches wide and 13 inches long. Dab the jam down the center, in a ribbon about 2 inches wide. Fold the two flaps of pastry lengthwise over the filling, overlapping slightly. Pinch the seam together down the length of the cake. Pinch the ends together so the jam can’t ooze out during baking.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Baking and Serving:</span> Transfer the pastry to the baking sheet, and sprinkle with the 2 teaspoons sugar. Bake 25 minutes. Reduce the heat to 250°F and bake another 25 minutes. Serve the <span class="italic">Ciambelle</span> warm or at room temperature. Cut it into slices about ½ inch thick, and arrange them on a platter.</p>

<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Codifying <span class="italic">Ciambelle</span> defies all logic. It translates as “ring cake,” yet this traditional recipe is for a long loaf that looks like a flattened baguette. In pastry shops throughout the region, you can find long loaves (with or without a jam filling) sitting side by side with the same pastry baked into rings. Even more confounding, some are like pound cakes while others resemble sweet buttery biscuits. Each is called <span class="italic">Ciambelle</span>. Seventeenth-century Bolognese engravings show street vendors hawking <span class="italic">Ciambelle</span> rings—they carried them strung like doughnuts on long poles. Early recipes describe sweet <span class="italic">Ciambelle</span> like this recipe, as well as savory ones baked without sugar. Every part of the region has its favorite version, and the name changes according to where you happen to be. What is the true <span class="italic">Ciambelle?</span> It is the one you are eating at that particular moment.</p>

Using a long metal spatula, cover the sides of the torte with a thin coating of chocolate buttercream. Spoon the remaining chocolate buttercream into a pastry bag fitted with a wide serated tip. Pipe an undulating border around the outer edge of the torte’s top layer. (There will be about ½ cup buttercream left over.)

<a id="page408"/>
<div class="box"><hr/>
<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">The Duchess of Parma</span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">There is only one. Although many women have held the title, in Parma when you say “Duchess of Parma,” everyone knows you are referring to Marie Louise of Austria. She was the city’s most beloved ruler, and her name is on everything suggesting refinement and excellence.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">As princess of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and wife to Napoleon, she was forced to make a choice. She could either go into exile with Napoleon on Elba or rule Parma with the assistance of Austrian general Adam Albert Neipperg. A dashing military man, Neipperg was tall, intelligent, and strikingly handsome. The black patch over his eye only added excitement. Historical gossip claims they were lovers even before Marie Louise had to decide between Parma and Napoleon. She chose Parma, sharing her reign with Neipperg, and the next 30 years were some of the brightest in Parma’s history. The city’s elegant neoclassic opera house is one tangible legacy of Marie Louise’s era. Some music experts say its audiences are even more demanding of singers than La Scala.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Another legacy is the city’s identifying color, “Parma yellow.” This soft golden yellow tinged with orange is always matte and velvety, never hard and flat. The opera house is Parma yellow, as are many of the town’s buildings. The color is a melding of the Hapsburg yellow of Marie Louise’s family crest and the yellow of France’s Bourbon ruling family, who held Parma during the 18th century. (Modena has its yellow, similar to Parma’s, stemming from Modena’s own long relationship with Austria.) Pastry shops share another Marie Louise legacy: influences from France and Austria that make Parma pastries more refined and intricate than most.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Marie Louise (or Maria Luigia as she is known in Parma) is still a presence in the city. Her picture is found in shops, homes, and restaurants almost as often as portraits of native son Giuseppe Verdi. The portrait you see most often is the one I like the least. In it she is young, her long narrow head looks overbred, and the blue eyes are bland. In a later portrait, painted when she was in her fifties, she is far more compelling. Experience, intelligence, and passion speak out from the pale face. The jaw and cheekbones are strong, the eyes glow. This is a woman who could rule a duchy, a duchess worthy of Parma.</p>

Using a wooden spatula, stir the custard continuously over medium-low heat 5 minutes, or until it reaches a temperature of 170°F and has thickened. Do not boil.

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">I have taken some liberties with the recipe. By creaming the butter and sugar, and eliminating some flour in the bottom crust, the tart is shorter, crisper, and even more like shortbread. Flour added to the top crust makes it less fragile, so it can be woven into the traditional lattice. Absolutely essential to the tart’s success is having the butter between 62° and 72°F so it can fluff to maximum volume and easily absorb all the flour</span>.</p>

<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Although nothing can be exactly as it was, dishes like this give us a glimpse into the past. Pastry crusts with saffron were common in the 16th century, and cinnamon, pepper, and orange flavored sweet as well as savory dishes. Typical of the period, too, was the pound <span class="italic">each</span> of butter and sugar that I have eliminated in this modern version. The original recipe calls for either wheat kernels, <span class="italic">farro</span>, or rice—a choice that appears in many recipes of the era. <span class="italic">Farro</span> is spelt, or emmer, two very old strains of wheat used by the ancient Romans and still found in central Italian dishes today. Although there are slight differences between the two grains, in Italy <span class="italic">farro</span> refers to them both. After discovering that wheat grains bake into hard kernels, I turned to spelt. Surprisingly, it closely resembles barley in flavor.  To find spelt in the United States. But the even more readily available barley makes a fine alternative. The homey-sounding tart turns exotic with its topping of either candied melon seeds or anise seeds, which suggest the Arab influences on the sweets of the Renaissance. Toasted pine nuts are the third choice offered in the original recipe.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">F<span class="italic">ew ever guess the secret ingredient of these pastries from Parma. Enveloped in the sweet crust are tastes of vanilla, citron, and almond. The mystery lies in their filling. Cooking fresh spinach in sugar may come as a surprise to many, but sweet spinach tarts are found in Reggio, in France, and even in 18th-century England. I suspect if we could stroll through the markets of ancient Persia and India, we would find them there too. Ugo Falavigna, of Parma’s Pasticerria Torino, believes the original of this recipe came from Austria to Parma in the early 19th century. He claims it came from the court cook to Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma. Whatever their origins, the turnovers are absolutely delicious and elegant enough to end the most important of dinners. I often serve them after a frozen or fruit-based dessert with coffee in the living room</span>.</p>

Once the liquid is clear and the sugar is melted (about 3 minutes), cook over medium heat another 2 minutes. Allow to cool. Strain the cooled syrup into a large stainless steel bowl. Whisk in the egg yolks and 3 tablespoons of the almond syrup. Set the bowl over a pot of boiling water, making sure it does not touch the water. Whisk until the custard is very thick, 2 to 5 minutes. It will reach about 165°F on an instant-reading thermometer. Whisk <a id="page431"/>in the last 3 tablespoons almond syrup and the vanilla. Immediately turn the custard into the bowl of an electric mixer, and beat at medium-low speed 5 minutes. Then beat at low speed 10 minutes, or until cooled to room temperature. Scoop half the mixture into another bowl. Thoroughly blend the melted chocolate into that custard. Stir the crushed pistachios into the remaining custard.

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Assembling the Zuppa Inglese:</span> Although Agnoletti suggests lining a mold with Spanish Sponge Cake, filling it, and then burying it in the snow, there is another method that makes unmolding a little easier. Line an 8¼ by 4¼-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap, leaving a generous overhang. Slice the cake in half vertically. Using a long serrated knife, divide each half horizontally into three very thin sheets of cake. Trim two pieces to fit the long sides of the loaf pan, and another two smaller pieces to slip into the short ends. Before fitting them into the loaf pan, barely moisten the cake with rum syrup by lightly brushing each slice. Do not cover the bottom of the loaf pan with cake.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Fill the mold half full with the almond custard, smoothing with a spatula. Any extra custard can be frozen for later use. Trim a slice of cake to fit over the custard, completely covering it. Set it in place, pressing gently with the palm of your hand. Sprinkle it with a little liqueur. Spread all the chocolate custard over the cake, and completely cover it with another trimmed slice of cake. Do not sprinkle this slice with liqueur. Use scissors to trim and even out the side slices of cake. Pull up the overhanging plastic wrap to cover, and seal the mold. Freeze from 12 hours to 1 month.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Decorating and Serving:</span> About 30 minutes before serving, remove the mold from the freezer. Use four pieces of wax paper to cover the sides of an oval or rectangular serving dish. Turn the mold out onto the dish. First lift off the pan, then gently pull away the plastic wrap. Thickly frost the top and sides with the whipped cream, using a long narrow spatula and circular motions to create lavish swirls. Lightly crush the pistachios with the side of a large knife. Arrange them in a row about ¾ inch wide down the center of the cake, then down the two narrow ends to the platter. Stud the slivers of red cherry here and there among the green nuts. Refrigerate the cake up to 30 minutes, then cut into ½-inch-thick slices.</p>

<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">The provenance of this unusual <span class="italic">zuppa inglese</span> may seem more French than Italian, even though the name means “English Soup.” But according to its 19th-century creator, Vincenzo Agnoletti, cook to the Duchess of Parma, <span class="italic">zuppa inglese</span> did originate in Italy. Writing sometime shortly before 1834, he claims the <span class="italic">zuppa</span> came full circle from Italy through France and England, then back into contemporary fashion in Italy. The custard in this dish is made with a sugar syrup rather than the more usual milk or cream. The French use this same technique today for frozen parfaits. Agnoletti offered it as one of his many variations on making custard. He suggested varying flavorings with vanilla, coffee, or fruit purées. Change the custards to your own taste as desired. Modern <span class="italic">zuppe inglese</span> in Emilia-Romagna and throughout Italy differ slightly from this one. They are not frozen. Rather, most are a custard trifle molded in a loaf or dome shape. Layers of liqueur-soaked cake enclose dense pastry creams in assorted flavors. Rum syrup often moistens the cake. But Emilia-Romagna shares Tuscany’s taste for Alchermes, the liqueur of spices, flowers, and red cochineal brought to Italy by Arab invaders many centuries ago. Alchermes is often used to soak the cake of the region’s <span class="italic">zuppe inglese</span>, turning the dessert a startling crimson. There are few restaurant dessert tables in Emilia-Romagna without a <span class="italic">zuppa inglese</span>, and most of them are Alchermes red.</p>

Fold in the rest of the whites, leaving a few streaks of white. Sift a quarter of the flour mixture over the eggs, and gently fold it in.

<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">A Little History</span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">What the basic butter cake is to America, Spanish Sponge is to Italy. For centuries Emilia-Romagna’s court and convent kitchens turned out the cake. A Bolognese recipe from the early 1600s instructs the cook to beat the eggs and sugar for an hour and a half before adding flour! The cake appears again in the 18th century as a specialty of the Bolognese Abbey of Saints Naborre and Felice. There it was cut into long slices and eaten plain. Although many believe Spanish Sponge entered Italy through Naples, where the Spanish ruled, I would not discount Emilia-Romagna’s strong Spanish connections. During the Medieval and Renaissance periods, Ferrara’s court and Bologna’s university were international centers. Parma had a long relationship with Spain, culminating in the early 18th century when Duchess Elisabetta Farnese married King Philip V of Spain. No doubt Parma gained recipes as well as intrigues, politics, and fashions through that alliance.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Concentrating the Milk:</span> In a 3-quart saucepan, combine the milk, lemon zest, cloves, cinnamon stick, and vanilla bean. Bring to a boil, and cook at a lively bubble 10 minutes, taking care that the milk does not boil over. The milk should be reduced by about one fifth. Remove the pan from the heat, add the sugar, and stir until it melts. Let the milk cool to room temperature.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Blending and Baking the Custard:</span> Preheat the oven to 350°F. Use the 2 teaspoons butter to grease a 2¼-cup baking dish with a diameter of about 7 inches and sides about 1½ inches high. Set out a slightly larger baking pan to use for a water <a id="page441"/>bath. Baking in a water bath shields the custard from the toughening effects of direct heat. Shield it further by folding a kitchen towel in half and laying it over the bottom of the larger pan. The custard dish will be set on the towel and then the boiling water poured in. (The custard could also be divided among five ½-cup buttered ramekins. Use a baking pan large enough to hold them without touching, and set them on a towel in the pan as described above.)</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Bring about 2 quarts water to a boil in a kettle. Give the cooled milk a stir, and then pour it through a strainer into a mixing bowl. Thoroughly whisk in the eggs and yolk. Pour into the custard dish, and cover the dish (or each ramekin) with foil. Set the custard dish (or ramekins) in the towel-lined baking pan, and set the pan on the center rack of the oven. Carefully pour boiling water into the water pan, to within ½ inch of the top of the custard dish (or ramekins). Bake 50 minutes, or until a knife inserted halfway between the center of the custard and its edge comes out clean. The center will still be creamy. (If baking in ramekins, test them after 25 minutes.) Turn off the oven, open the door, and let the custard sit in the water bath about 15 minutes. Then remove it from the bath and cool it on a rack.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Serving:</span> Turn the custard out onto a round dinner plate (or on individual dessert dishes). Cover and chill.

When I was a kid we would roam the farms, hunting melons. When we found them, we sat right there in the field and feasted. The farmers were furious. Hiding watermelon patches is a fine art here.

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Chestnuts used to be the wheat of Italy’s mountain people. Land for growing wheat is scarce in the hills, but there is room enough for chestnut trees to flourish. Flour ground from the dried nuts made pastas, breads, cakes, and fritters. Even the aromatic dried leaves were saved. Moistened with water, they became flavorful wrappings for cushioning flatbreads baked on stone griddles, and for protecting vegetable patties cooking between clay tiles or under heated clay domes. But the biggest treats of chestnut season were the newly harvested nuts of October and November. Everyone reveled in their sweetness</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Even today, hot roasted chestnuts are sold on street corners in towns and cities, and autumn chestnut festivals thrive in mountain villages throughout Emilia-Romagna. At Castel del Rio, in the mountains of Bologna province, crowds gather on October weekends for the town’s annual chestnut festival. In front of the village’s medieval castle, local men roast chestnuts over blazing fires</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">The nuts are traditionally cooked in giant-size black pans that are suspended over the flames by chains hooked up to iron tripods. The pans’ long handles are the levers used to flip the chestnuts into the air. The nuts hover for a moment over the sparks and flames. There is an intake of breath. Will they fall back into the pan or disappear into the fire? Invariably the nuts land safely and continue roasting until their shells are brittle and almost charred</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">The festival-goers buy little bags of the hot nuts and plastic cups of the season’s new red wine. Sloughing off the black shells with one hand, they sip from the cup in the other. Sweet and meaty, the chestnuts taste the way their burning leaves smell—of forests, honey, and sweet hay</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">In the marketplace, freshly gathered chestnuts glow like polished mahogany nuggets in large baskets. Marring their beauty with cooking seems a sin, until you reach into the bag of still-warm roasted nuts, rub off more shell, and eat. The sin is venial rather than mortal</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Chestnut desserts are loved today, but in the old days they were special indeed. Years before prosperity and transportation brought sugar and sweets to the mountains, dried chestnuts made most of the desserts. Dried and left whole, or ground into flour, the nuts became the cakes, breads, fritters, and winter puddings. Whole nuts are still reconstituted into soups, stews, pastas, and fillings. One mountain valley in Parma <a id="page448"/>celebrates the New Year by stuffing turkey with nothing but fragrant chestnuts</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Fresh chestnuts always mean Christmas in Emilia-Romagna. No matter how many elaborate desserts crowd the table, hot chestnuts roasted over an open fire are still treasured. Rushed from the hearth, they are shelled hot and dropped into glasses of sweet red wine. The wine changes from place to place, but the tradition is always the same</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Fortunately, some of these desserts can be made in our kitchens. Each of the recipes shared here emphasizes a different dimension of the chestnut and another facet of its traditions. Sweet chestnut flour becomes fritters like the ones sold in Castel del Rio’s town square. An old dish from Parma’s mountains emphasizes the goodness of freshly roasted chestnuts with a flamboyant flambé. The special quality chestnuts bring to cakes and baked puddings is illustrated in Chestnut Ricotta Cheesecake, adapted from traditional recipes found throughout Emilia and Romagna</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">If you are lucky enough to live in an area with Italian markets, you will find fresh chestnuts in good supply during November and December. The freshest ones are plump, fragrant, and shiny, looking like polished wood. Taste them in all their natural sweetness, just as they are eaten in Emilia-Romagna after special winter meals. Simply roast the chestnuts as described in Desserts, and serve them with sweet red wine for dunking. Of course these are excellent, too, in the recipes that follow</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Since most of the United States’ chestnut trees were destroyed by blight in the early part of this century, imported chestnuts stock our stores. Sometimes it takes a long while for them to reach their final destination. If the chestnuts you can find are starting to dry out, turning dark and matte in appearance, don’t worry—once roasted they can still be quite flavorful.

Cover a baking sheet with a triple thickness of paper towels. Preheat the oven to 175° to 200°F. Just before frying, whip the egg whites to stiff peaks. Lighten the chestnut batter by stirring in a quarter of the whites. Then, using big round strokes, fold the remaining whites into the batter, keeping the mixture light.

Because cheesemaking is unfamiliar to many, the instructions lead you through the process step by step. Keep in mind that slowly heating the milk mixture develops a soft ricotta curd. Fast heating hardens the curd, producing a very different cheese.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Stir together all the ingredients except the salt in a heavy 6-quart saucepan with a nonreactive interior. Set the pan over medium-low heat. Cook 40 minutes, or until the milk reaches 170°F on an instant-reading thermometer. Keep the heat at medium-low. To keep the curd large, do not stir more than three or four times. If you lift it with the spatula, you will see sandlike particles of milk forming as the clear whey begins separating from the curd. As the milk comes close to 170°F, the curds will be <a id="page455"/>slightly larger, about the size of an uncooked lentil. When the temperature reaches 170°F, turn the heat up to medium. Do not stir. Take 6 to 8 minutes to bring the mixture to 205° to 208°F when measured at the center of the pot. The liquid whey will be almost clear. By the time the cheese comes to 205°F, the curd should mound on the spatula like a soft white custard. At 205°F to 208°F, the liquid will be on the verge of boiling, with the surface looking like mounds about to erupt. Turn off the heat and let the cheese stand 10 minutes.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">“Keeping cakes”—dense cakes full of spices and fruit—were first created in Medieval convents and monasteries, where they were baked in the autumn and stored away to mellow until Christmas</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">In Emilia-Romagna, as in all of Italy, each area has its own traditional keeping cake. The three shared in this chapter stand out for their popularity in their respective provinces. They also illustrate the sometimes subtle and often intriguing differences in keeping cakes. Shadings of taste are dictated by tradition and built flavor by flavor, with nuances coming from unexpected ingredients like red wine, chocolate, or black pepper. For those of us who know only the American/British fruitcake, these could be fine additions to a holiday repertoire</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Parma’s and Reggio’s <span class="underline">Spongata</span> honey cake seems more like a pastry than a cake. Its disc of golden crust encloses a filling of nuts, fruits, and bread crumbs, held together with honey. The round dark loaves of <span class="underline">Pampepato</span> from Ferrara taste of spices, chocolate, citron, and orange. Bologna’s spice and honey cake, the <span class="underline">Certosino,</span> is distinguished by candied fruits not only in the cake but decorating its top as well</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Although each of these cakes seems quite different, they are all variations on a theme shared with keeping cakes found throughout Italy and much of Europe. Baked into the cakes are the preserved treasures of the autumn harvest; fruits, nuts, and sweeteners. Everything precious was employed in celebrating Christmas, the most important moment of the Christian year</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Each cook used the best ingredients he or she could afford. Candied fruits expressed the ultimate wealth of processed sugar, an expensive commodity until the 19th century. In the Middle Ages, topping Bologna’s <span class="underline">Certosino</span> cake with its big chunks of candied fruits was like displaying emeralds and rubies</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Honey was more easily had and much less expensive than sugar. Honey still sweetness <span class="underline">Certosino</span> and <span class="underline">Spongata.</span> Poorer convents and monasteries substituted honey for sugar. In wine-growing areas, cooked-down grape syrup was the least expensive sweetener of all. Even today, grape syrup and dried fruits (rather than candied ones) separate Modena’s Christmas cake from the honey-and-candied-fruit-sweetened <span class="underline">Certosino</span> of neighboring Bologna</span>.</p>
<a id="page457"/>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Spices traveled long distances from exotic places. Stored under lock and key, they were used with great care. They were thought to cure ills and to preserve food against spoilage, as well as giving incomparable flavor to all sorts of dishes. What a treat it must have been to eat a cake flavored with precious cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and pepper. It was the spices, not the sugar or the fruit, that gave these cakes their names. A common name for a keeping cake is <span class="underline">pan speziale,</span> meaning spiced bread; the <span class="underline">speziale</span> was the spice seller or pharmacist. Peppered bread, <span class="underline">pamp</span> or <span class="underline">pan pepato,</span> evolved into Ferrara’s <span class="underline">Pampepato.</span></span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">As time passed, spices and sugar became more affordable. But a new treasure entered the Christmas cakes: chocolate. A 17th-century Bolognese recipe describes making chocolate from the cocoa bean. Bologna’s aristocrats of the early 1600s sipped hot chocolate scented with cinnamon, jasmine, and ambergris. But most likely, chocolate was not baked into Christmas cakes until the 19th century. Today chocolate sets apart Ferrara’s <span class="underline">Pampepato</span>—not only is it a flavoring, but a full cloak of chocolate seals the cake. Even Bologna’s <span class="underline">Certosino,</span> created by the Medieval Carthusian monks, received its measure of chocolate during the 1800s</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Flavorings may shift slightly with evolving tastes, but the cakes’ role never changes.

<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">In the Land of Giuseppe Verdi</span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Along the Po River on Emilia-Romagna’s plain, you can still find towns where life is little changed. In his book <span class="italic">The Po of Mysteries (Un Po di Misteri)</span>, Enzo Sermasi writes about the country at the Parma/Piacenza border, where composer Giuseppi Verdi was born, lived, and died, and where he remains a living entity. There village men gather in wine taverns where “plastic and Coca-Cola have not passed through the door.” They drink wine in the old way—from small white bowls, not as a beverage but as a food. The men dance together, and they sing Verdi as easily as they make conversation. Shaking his head, one old man says, “Young people don’t like Verdi. No, no, I know it sounds impossible, but they do not.” Then he adds with a grin, “But when they grow up it changes. It is inevitable.”</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">In shops and homes throughout Parma province, pictures of Verdi replace the usual portraits of political leaders. There are the local specialties that have become Verdi foods—Christmas <span class="italic">Spongata</span> cake and the cured pork shoulder of San Secondo. So famous for creating exquisite eating from every part of the pig, Parma has a saying: “The pig is like the music of Verdi—there is nothing left to throw away.”</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">The Parma plain feels timeless, its green pastures and small farms unchanged in centuries. Verdi country is addictive. Does anyone here <span class="italic">not</span> eat well? At Trattoria Vernizzi in Frescarolo di Busseto, there is a collection of Verdi memorabilia and wonderful culatello. This small local ham, cured solely on this tiny stretch of plain, rarely leaves Parma province and is prized even above Parma ham. Dinner at Vernizzi is filled with laughter, as we win the owner’s approval by nearly swooning over the quality of his culatello. Even the butter is extraordinary in its sweetness. La Buca, in Zibello, is another jewel on the Verdi plain, where mothers and daughters have cooked for three generations. It is a small house with two rooms opening off a wide entry hall. On the left is the room for diners, on the right, the bar. Neither has changed much in 80 years.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Smart diners from Mantua, Parma, and Piacenza come to eat handmade tagliatelle and pastas filled with sweet squash, the local cured pork shank with piquant apple conserve, and vegetables grown within shouting distance. In the bar village life continues, seemingly untouched by anything known to the diners across the hall. Men play cards around the one big table. Only dialect is spoken, and although we are noted with amiable nods, we know not to intrude; this is not of our life. But we do touch in a subtle way. Verdi’s <span class="italic">Aida</span> plays on a radio in the background. As I unconsciously sway to the music, some of the agreeable nods become warm smiles. For a moment Verdi is our link. Then the men turn back to their cards. I turn to follow my hostess, who wants to show me how to make culatello.</p>
