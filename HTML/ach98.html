<p class="author1"><span class="txit">riso e latte di “bertilla”</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">Gianni named this dish for his mother, Maria-Bertilla, who would make it for him as an after-school snack. “I savored each bite,” Gianni recalls, “spooning around the edges of the bowl toward the center until each morsel was eaten.”</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 cups milk</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups water</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cups arborio rice</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon butter or olive oil</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Bring the milk and water to boil in a large saucepan set over medium-high heat. Stir in the rice and salt to taste. Simmer until the rice has absorbed most of the liquid, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool for 2 minutes. The rice should be creamy and, when poured into bowls, should be <span class="txit">all’onda,</span> which means “wavy.” Top each portion with a little butter or olive oil. Serve immediately.</p>
