<p class="noindent"><em>“Skål!”</em> (Pronounced “scawl.”)</p>
<p class="indent">This toast has, since at least the Viking age, been a symbol of friendship, respect, and togetherness, and any visitor to Scandinavia will be surprised at how frequently the friendly word is uttered. But it does not take long to discover that the amiable encouragement to drink up has a long and apparent history. In the Viking sagas, a man who did not drink up his horn when a toast was presented was seen as unreliable. Knowing how to drink, that is, to get as drunk as your drinking companions, neither much more nor less, was a quality just as highly regarded by the Vikings as strength, honesty, and brutality.</p>
<p class="indent">Luckily, our societies have progressed considerably since the time when the fearless and cruel Vikings terrorized the good people of Europe. Our thirst has also diminished considerably. But Scandinavians are still social drinkers, and to a not-so-thirsty stranger, the social aspect may <a id="page_284"/>feel like something in between friendliness and coercion.</p>
<p class="indent">As recently as the nineteenth century, a dinner party in rural Sweden could include as many as seven toasts: a “welcome toast” as the guests arrived (and more than one if the guests arrived in several groups), an “appetite toast” as the party was seated, a “fish toast” with the fish, a “meat toast,” a “pancake toast” with dessert, a “give thanks for the food toast,” and a “farewell toast.” If even more toasts were exchanged over the table, a dinner party could be quite excruciating, at least for a stranger lacking the stamina of his or her Scandinavian hosts. The only thing not allowed, if there were more than five people at the table, was toasting the hostess. Drunkenness was more a rule than an exception, and in order to have some control over the situation, the hostess had to be excused from the mandatory drinking.</p>
<p class="indent">What you drink helps determine how you are drinking, and the aquavit, snaps, and beer culture of Scandinavia may explain why we love to toast. Going back in history, the mead and beer made by the Vikings was so weak that great quantities had to be drunk before any effect could be felt. At the other extreme, neither aquavit—spiced and cask-aged potato liquor—nor snaps—spiced or herb-infused grain spirits—is meant to be savored. Unlike wine, which should be sniffed, sipped, and enjoyed as slowly as possible, aquavit or snaps should be tossed back quickly, the warm sensation you feel afterward being almost as important as the flavor.</p>
<p class="indent">There is an old saying that “the Danes live to eat, the Norwegians eat to live, and the Swedes eat to drink.” While Danes traditionally enjoyed eating rich food, and Norwegians struggled to survive, Swedes developed a rich culture of spiced spirits, easy homemade alternatives to the expensive aquavit, whose production was normally controlled by the aristocracy or clergy. In 1756, Sweden had more than 180,000 registered home distilleries, one for every ten Swedes. Today snaps is one of the most important aspects of the Swedish gastronomic heritage, a tradition that is continually expanded to include new, more exotic flavors like lemongrass and kumquat.</p>
<p class="indent">Snaps and aquavit were seen as something in between medicine and alcohol, and even people who claim they do not drink have been known to take the occasional sip of aquavit to “help arthritis” or snaps to “clear a sore throat,” “alleviate indigestion,” or “improve circulation.” Assigning different medicinal qualities to different types of snaps is partly a continuation of the traditional herbal medicine, partly an excuse for drinking.</p>
<p class="indent">Making your own snaps is an easy way to turn plain vodka into something interesting. If the liquor you are using as a starting point is good and quite neutral in its flavor, the process is very easy: Just put something spicy or tasty that you like—be it parsley, lemon zest, coriander seeds, chile peppers, rose petals, or ginger—into a couple cups of liquor and let it stand for a few days. The alcohol will draw flavor, and sometimes color, out of the spices, leaving the various types you make not only different tasting, but also different looking. I think I like the process of making snaps as much as drinking it—seeing how the spirits start to change color and sipping a small sample of each every evening to ascertain whether it is done or needs one more day before I can remove the spices and place it in a bottle with a homemade label.</p>

</div>
<p class="noindents">MAKES 1 LITER</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>One 1-liter bottle grain vodka</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 lemon, washed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon coriander seeds</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Pour the vodka into a glass jar. With a sharp knife or potato peeler, remove the colored zest from the lemon. Add lemon zest and coriander seeds to the vodka and close the jar tightly. Let stand at room temperature for 2 to 4 days, depending on how much flavor you want and how intense the aromatic oils in the lemon zest are. If you want to speed up the process, place the jar in a sunny window.</p>
<p class="noindentt">While the snaps is macerating, wash off the label from the original bottle and replace with a homemade label.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Strain the snaps and pour back into the bottle. Add a few of the coriander seeds to the bottle for decorative purposes. Serve in shot glasses.</p>

<p class="noindent"><small><strong><em>GLØGG</em> IS NORMALLY SWEETENED WITH SUGAR, BUT HONEY IS MUCH MORE AROMATIC. USE A SPICY RED WINE, A SYRAH OR GRENACHE, FOR EXAMPLE.</strong></small></p>
</div>
<p class="noindents">MAKES 1 QUART</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup water</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 to 4 tablespoons honey or sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 stick cinnamon</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 whole cloves</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 cardamom seeds</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>One 750-ml bottle red wine</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ orange, sliced</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">In a medium pot, combine the water, honey, cinnamon, cloves, and cardamom, and bring to boil. Simmer over medium-low heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour half the syrup into a separate bowl, being careful not to pour out any spices. Add the red wine to the pot containing the spices and remaining syrup. Heat over medium-low heat until the temperature is about 170°F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove from heat and add the orange slices. Add the reserved syrup to taste. Serve warm.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindent">This is the traditional drink that is normally served at pre-Christmas parties, when days are at their darkest and people really need something uplifting. In the traditional drink—<em>gløgg</em> in Norwegian—it is normal to add a generous amount of vodka to the hot wine, but I find that too overpowering and, frankly, too intoxicating.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_291"/>THE WATER OF LIFE</h3>
<p class="image"><a id="page_290"/><img alt="image" src="../images/14fig03.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Aquavit is the national drink of Norway, and undoubtedly the most important drink in the whole of Scandinavia. No traditional Scandinavian meat-rich meal should be served without a little digestive help from a small glass or two of the heavily spiced potato or grain liquor.</p>
<p class="indent">Aquavit dates back at least to 1531, when the archbishop of Trondheim received a bottle of liquor along with a letter stating, “I send Your Grace some water called <em>Aqua vitae.</em> This water cures all types of internal diseases from which a human being may suffer.” Its name, of Latin origin, means “water of life,” and at first it was hailed as a remedy for everything from labor pains and rheumatism to indigestion, headaches, colds, gangrene, and lice. Lumbermen were supplied with bottles of aquavit in order to keep warm and to have something to drink that would not freeze while they worked in the forest, and farm workers would have a glass or two in the morning before they went out to the fields. After a while, the authorities realized that aquavit too had its limitations and started discouraging its use and levying taxes on it like other alcoholic beverages. But by then it was a part of the national character, and versions were made in tens of thousands of home distilleries—a tradition that is still practiced today.</p>
<p class="indent">Although its name points to a close relationship with other “waters of life,” like the French eau-de-vie and Scottish-Irish whiskey (whose original name, <em>usquebaugh,</em> also means “water of life”), aquavit seems to have developed into something uniquely Scandinavian. The Norwegian versions are made from potato liquor, but in Sweden and Denmark they may be also made from grain liquor. Most are heavily flavored with caraway, dill seeds, and fennel, some with anise, coriander, cumin, lemon zest, wormwood, or cinnamon. Certain varieties are aged in oak casks; others are served young and raw.</p>
<p class="indent">I enjoy a cold shot of well-made aquavit with traditional foods, especially around Christmas, and as something warming after a long ski trip. I am, however, forced to admit that I prefer the aquavit I make myself to the store-bought variety. Only then do I have full control over all the flavors.</p>

</div>
<p class="noindents">MAKES 1 LITER</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons caraway seeds, or more</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon fennel seeds</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons dill seeds</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 star anise</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon coriander seeds</strong></p>

<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons cumin seeds (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>One 1-liter bottle potato vodka</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Add the spices to the vodka bottle and cover tightly. Let stand for 2 to 3 weeks, depending on how strong you want the aquavit to be. Shake the bottle every once in a while.</p>
<p class="noindentt">When the aquavit has reached the desired intensity of flavor, strain and discard the solids; return the aquavit to the bottle.</p>
