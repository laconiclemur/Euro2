  <p class="center-para"><a id="page_171" class="calibre1"></a>Preserving fruit and veg at the end of summer was a normal part of life when I was growing up. It was a way of keeping the scents and flavours of produce long after it was in season and was also a good reason to get together with friends and family – we celebrated the end of a bountiful season and went to work to preserve as much as we possibly could to see us through the winter. Bell peppers, aubergines (eggplants), courgettes (zucchini) and green beans were all preserved and we knew we would have to wait until the next summer before these vegetables reappeared in our gardens and market stalls. But also, in preserving, the taste changed, resulting in wonderful ingredients for antipasti or fillings for panini.</p>

  <p class="center-para">Our beloved tomato was the highlight of those late summer days – family and friends would gather together to bottle, sun-dry and make <em class="calibre4">concentrato</em> (tomato purée/paste) in the last of the hot summer sun. My job, as a boy, was to collect as many beer bottles as I could, in which to store a year-long supply of our local San Marzano tomatoes, grown around the Vesuvio area. Whole days would be spent carefully preserving tomatoes, and not just in our family: everyone in the village did the same – we even exchanged them as gifts to see whose tomatoes were nicer.</p>

  <p class="center-para">I still like to preserve as much as I can, and whenever I go on a mushroom hunt and strike lucky with basketfuls, I make sure they never go wasted and preserve them in oil to enjoy later in the year, usually at Christmas time. And when my friend Paolo has a glut of vegetables grown in his allotment, he shares them with me so they can be preserved. This year was it was beetroot and green beans. Markets are a great way of buying quantities of produce at good value, so if I see peppers or aubergines sold in bulk, as long as they are fresh, I buy them with preserving in mind.</p>

  <p class="center-para">Fruit, too, gets bottled; I love summer walks in the forest and fields and am always on the lookout for tiny damson plums, wild cherries and berries. Not only to be made into delicious jam but also to preserve in alcohol to liven up desserts.</p>

  <p class="center-para">Making preserves and bottling fruits and vegetables is a wonderful stress buster for me – not only do I enjoy foraging outdoors, I also love the ritual of preparing what I have collected, organizing the jars and putting them into my store cupboard. When the jars eventually get opened, each one has a story to tell – it may be where I picked that particular fruit or what sort of day it had been – and the taste of summer suddenly brightens up the dull of winter.</p>
