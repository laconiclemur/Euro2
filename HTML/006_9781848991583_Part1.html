<p class="normalw"><b>In this chapter, you will find a few basic recipes that are essentials in many of my dishes, like a homemade stock and a salad dressing. Plus, I’ve selected some recipes that are perfect to serve with the main courses in this book. Complex dishes are complemented most effectively by the simplest accompaniments, and if they are carefully created using the best ingredients, then you really cannot go wrong.</b></p>
