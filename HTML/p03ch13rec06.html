<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">Rice pudding is popular all over Spain, especially in the north, which is dairy country. It is always flavored with a cinnamon stick and a strip of lemon peel. Most versions are made quite thick. Some are baked in the oven, others made on the stovetop. In Asturias, they sometimes add butter and caramelize the top. My favorite is this very creamy version from Navarre, with the good amount of liquid left at the end thickened with egg yolk. Be prepared for a long cooking time, up to an hour or so; risotto rice will take the longest. Serve it cold, at room temperature, or warm.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 4 TO 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">6½ cups whole milk</p>
<p class="qun">1 cinnamon stick</p>
<p class="qun">Peel of ½ lemon—removed in 1 or 2 long strips</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup risotto rice, such as Arborio or Carnaroli</p>
<p class="qun">½ cup sugar, or more to taste</p>
<p class="qun">4 large egg yolks</p>
<p class="qun1">Cinnamon for sprinkling (optional)</p>
<p class="recsum">Bring the milk to a boil with the cinnamon stick and lemon peel in a large saucepan. Add the rice and cook gently over very low heat for 45 minutes to 1 hour, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon so that the rice does not stick at the bottom (especially at the start), until it is very soft.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Stir in the sugar and cook for another 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the lemon peel and cinnamon stick. There should still be a good amount of liquid left.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Beat the egg yolks lightly in a small bowl. Beat in a few tablespoonfuls of the milk and rice so the yolks won’t curdle, then pour into the pan, stirring vigorously for seconds only, until the liquid becomes creamy. Do not let boil, or the yolks will curdle.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Pour into a serving dish or little bowls. Serve warm, chilled, or at room temperature, with a light dusting of cinnamon if you like.</p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">VARIATION</span></p>
<p class="summary">Omit the cinnamon. Just before serving, sprinkle the top of the pudding evenly with 3 tablespoons of sugar, and caramelize with a mini blowtorch.</p>
