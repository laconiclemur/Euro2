  <p class="nonindent">Although the vegetable dishes in Germany are not the most exciting elements in that country’s cuisine, they are far better than one is led to believe in German restaurants here. I have a feeling this is because American diners are used to having one or two vegetables alongside their meat and potatoes, and feel cheated if they do not. Since most German vegetable dishes are rich and complicated and require careful timing, it would seem wasteful to any frugal person to serve them merely as a garnish or Beilage—”lay-by.” Therefore, in an effort to cater to this American blue-plate requirement, the chef simply adds one or two tepid, unseasoned, overcooked canned vegetables to the platter and sends it out—meat, potatoes and two vegetables.</p>

  <p class="indent">In Germany, vegetables are taken more seriously, as they are in Italy and the French provinces. They appear only as standard accompaniments to the entree when they are especially and traditionally suited to it, such as certain cabbage and sauerkraut preparations are to certain meats and wursts. While in some international-type restaurants one is served steak or roast meat, platter style, surrounded with several vegetables as a garnish, this is an exception and not at all in keeping with the spirit of German cooking. Vegetable dishes, richly sauced, perhaps baked, fried or puffed into soufflés and puddings, are important enough to be a separate course. In rural homes they are often the dinner entree, followed by a platter of cold cuts and cheese or a rich pudding. Such an entrée <a id="page259"></a>might consist of a single vegetable such as cauliflower or asparagus, covered with a creamy cheese sauce and browned in the oven, or it may be a huge platter of assorted vegetables—a whole cauliflower in the center surrounded by five to eight other vegetables, selected for color as well as flavor. A bowl of hot Cream Sauce, Hollandaise or Cheese Sauce might be served on the side and a few of the vegetables will be topped with breadcrumbs browned in hot butter.</p>

  <p class="indent">The variety of vegetables served in Germany is staggering, and I don’t think I will forget a 5 <span class="small">A.M</span>. visit I made to the wholesale vegetable market in West Berlin just before Easter. There were literally miles of magnificent stalls decked with every vegetable we know here and many that are found only in a few foreign market sections in the United States and were therefore unfamiliar. Vegetables that were sold in large quantities were packed in net bags colored to match the vegetables themselves. Pale green cabbages were strung up in jade-colored mesh, red cabbages in amethyst sacks; yellow turnips in gold, and so on. You can be sure they all tasted every bit as good as they looked and for the most part had a much more robust, natural flavor than any we get here, unless one is lucky enough to live near small farms. The tomatoes and mushrooms were the most surprising of all, the first being sun-ripened and ruby-red, with a flavor I haven’t tasted in a tomato here for at least twenty years. As for the mushrooms, there are six or eight standard varieties, any of which make our own tasteless white mushrooms seem like balsa wood.</p>

  <p class="indent">Since Germany is a northern country, winter vegetables are extremely popular and widely used, much more so than here. All of the cabbages and root vegetables make frequent appearances on menus and there are a number of interesting ways in which they are prepared.</p>

  <p class="indent">As you might expect with people who hate to waste anything, vegetables are cooked in extremely healthy and economical ways in Germany. They are simmered or steamed quickly in as little water as possible, and often are first braised for a few minutes in hot fat. This is the best possible way to preserve their color, flavor and vitamins. In addition, vegetable cooking water is rarely thrown away. It is thickened into a sauce with an Einbrenne, or roux, or saved for soup stock. Leftover vegetables go into omelettes, puddings or fritters, or are served as salads the next day with vinaigrette sauce or mayonnaise.</p>

  <p class="indent">Almost any vegetable is used raw or cooked for a salad in Germany. The raw is usually sliced, cut or thinly grated, always marinated in Raw Vegetable Marinade and then sometimes finished with mayonnaise. Cooked vegetables, whole or cut in larger pieces, are covered with Cooked Vegetable Marinade while warm and then chilled. They may also be mixed with mayonnaise, depending upon your own preference and the vegetable in question. One thing in Germany that would delight any health-food addict is a Rohkostsalatplatte—a platter of assorted raw vegetables, arranged in a pinwheel pattern. This would include such things as grated beets, carrots, celery, red and/or white cabbage separately or mixed, sliced tomato, radish, some spikes of endive and <a id="page260"></a>a few bouquets of lettuce leaves. The vegetables may be plain, or marinated separately, and are sprinkled with minced parsley or dill. This is often an appetizer that is followed by a one-pot stew or soup entree.</p>

  <p class="center"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_007_r1.jpg" /></p>

  <p class="nonindent">The following two recipes are for general and typical preparations you can use when you want vegetables to “taste German.”</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_4"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>STEWED YOUNG VEGETABLES (Dünstgemüse)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">This pertains to young and tender vegetables, as follows: carrots, turnips, parsley root, parsnip, knob celery, small kohlrabi, horseradish, beets, spinach, lettuce, all cabbages, broccoli and Brussels sprouts, peas, beans, Swiss chard, tomatoes, cucumbers, squashes, peppers and mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">GENERALLY ABOUT 4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 pounds</em> young, <em>small vegetables in season</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 to 3 tablespoons butter or minced bacon</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ onion, minced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>seasonings to taste: such as minced parsley, dill, savory, marjoram, chives, nutmeg, pepper, sugar, lemon juice, vinegar, grated cheese, etc</em>.</p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 to 2 cups stock or water, as needed</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 to 2 tablespoons flour dissolved in a little cold water, or tiny dumplings made of 1 to 2 tablespoons butter and 1 to 2 tablespoons flour, kneaded together</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 or 4 tablespoons sweet or sour cream, optional and to taste</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page261"></a>Peel, trim and wash vegetables as necessary, and cut into suitable pieces or shapes. Heat butter or bacon in a heavy saucepan or casserole and when fat is hot, add onion. Cover and braise over low heat about 3 minutes, until onion is soft and transparent. Add vegetables, toss until well coated with fat; cover pan tightly and braise about 5 minutes, shaking pan once or twice to prevent scorching. Vegetables should have become intensely colored. Add herbs, spices or seasonings to taste. Sprinkle with salt and add about 1” liquid to pan. Cover tightly and simmer slowly but steadily until vegetables are tender, but not too soft. Add more liquid to pan as needed during cooking. Mix flour with water to a thin paste; or knead butter and flour together and form tiny dumplings. Add either of these bindings to hot but not boiling pan juices and simmer 3 or 4 minutes, or until sauce has thickened. Check seasoning, adding what is necessary and stir in cream if you are using it. Heat but do not boil.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_5"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>COOKED VEGETABLES (Kochgemüse)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">This method is used on any old or tough vegetables, or any that are inclined to be scaly, stringy or otherwise fibrous. These would include cauliflower, asparagus, oyster plant, knob celery if large, leeks, or any of the large or old vegetables mentioned above.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">GENERALLY 4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 pounds vegetables</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>water to cover</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ onion, minced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 to 2 cups vegetable stock, as needed</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>milk, cream or half-and-half, optional and to taste</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>seasonings such as minced parsley, savory, dill, marjoram, chervil, salt, pepper, nutmeg, lemon juice, vinegar, etc</em>.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Peel, trim, wash and cut vegetables as necessary. Cook until tender in just enough boiling salted water to cover, or steam in a vegetable steamer. If necessary to cut vegetables after cooking—i.e., chopped spinach or cabbage—drain well and do so. Reserve vegetable stock. Heat butter in a 1- to 2-quart saucepan and when hot and bubbling, add onion. Sauté and stir over low heat; you may fry onion from pale yellow to golden brown, depending on the flavor you want in your sauce. Add flour, stir and sauté about 5 or 6 minutes. The darker brown you want your sauce to be, the longer you should sauté the flour. Add 1½ cups of vegetable stock. Beat over low heat with a wire whisk or wooden spoon until <a id="page262"></a>sauce is smooth and thick. Add seasonings and herbs. Return vegetables to sauce and simmer together 10 to 15 minutes. Check seasoning again before serving. Milk, cream or half-and-half can be stirred in just before serving. Heat but do not boil.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATION</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Bacon can be substituted for butter if it seems suited to the vegetable you are cooking. Olive oil can be used if you do not intend to finish the sauce with milk or cream.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_6"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>VEGETABLES AU GRATIN (Überbackene Gemüse)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">This preparation is frequently found in Germany, mostly with such vegetables as artichoke hearts, asparagus, broccoli, leeks, cauliflower, oyster plant, knob celery and parsnips, but never with leaf vegetables or seed vegetables that become watery as they cook down. The vegetable in question is cleaned, trimmed, peeled and washed as necessary and cut into suitable shapes and sizes or left whole if small enough. It is then cooked in boiling water to cover with a little salt, until tender. The vegetables are drained and the stock reserved. The vegetables are then placed in a shallow buttered open baking dish, such as a pie plate. Prepare the Cheese Sauce, or the White Sauce, using vegetable stock as liquid and finishing off with heavy sweet cream but no egg yolks. Pour sauce over vegetables, sprinkle breadcrumbs and grated cheese and dot with butter. Bake in upper third of 475° oven about 10 minutes, or until sauce is bubbling-hot and top has a nicely browned crust.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_7"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>VEGETABLES UNDER CRUST (Überkrustete Gemüse)</em></h3>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">4 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 pounds vegetables in season, such as cauliflower, asparagus, leeks, chicory oyster plant, artichoke bottoms, etc. salt water to cover</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 to 3 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, approximately</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 to 4 tablespoons cream</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon tomato purée (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>chopped ham or smoked pork loin (Canadian bacon) (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent"><a id="page263"></a>Preheat oven to 475°. Wash and cut vegetables as necessary. Cauliflower may be left whole or broken into flowerets. Asparagus may be whole or cut in 2” lengths. Leeks should be split lengthwise if large. Remove bitter leaves from chicory and split head lengthwise. Oyster plant should be cut in finger-strips. Artichoke bottoms can be left whole. Cook until tender in just enough boiling salted water to cover. Drain well. Place vegetables in a buttered baking dish or casserole, depending on depth needed. Top with dots of butter and grated cheese. Plain cream can be poured over vegetables or it can be mixed with a little tomato purée and/or minced ham or smoked pork loin. Place in upper third of preheated oven about 10 to 15 minutes, or until vegetables are topped with a golden brown crust.</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_8"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>BERLIN VEGETABLE PUDDING (Gemüsepudding, auf Berliner Art)</em></h3>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ small cauliflower, cooked in flowerets</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup cooked green peas</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>6 to 8 cooked Brussels sprouts</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 or 3 cooked kohlrabi, or 6 or</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>8 cooked asparagus</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 or 3 small cooked carrots</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup sliced mushrooms, sautéed in butter or canned</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 cup milk</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt to taste</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>nutmeg to taste</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>5 egg yolks</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>5 egg whites, stiffly beaten</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>breadcrumbs</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Vegetables may be fresh, frozen or canned. If raw or partially cooked, they should be completely cooked, separately, in well-salted water and then drained. Cauliflower should be in flowerets; peas whole, Brussels sprouts cut in halves or quarters, if large; kohlrabi in strips; asparagus in 1” lengths; carrots in julienne strips or slices; mushrooms sliced. Combine together, tossing gently with a fork. Heat butter in a saucepan and when hot and bubbling, stir in flour. Stir and sauté slowly about 4 minutes, or until flour just begins to take on color. Add milk and beat smooth, over low heat, with a wire whisk or wooden spoon. Simmer sauce 5 minutes. Season with salt and nutmeg to taste, and cool completely.</p>

  <p class="indent">Preheat oven to 350°. When sauce is cool, beat yolks lightly and stir into sauce. Add vegetables and turn gently in sauce. Fold in stiffly beaten egg whites gently but thoroughly with a rubber spatula. Butter a 6-cup soufflé dish, or comparable baking dish, and sprinkle bottom and sides with breadcrumbs, tapping out excess. Turn vegetables into baking dish. Set in pan a third full of hot water and bake in preheated oven for about 1 hour, or until pudding has risen and is completely set.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page264"></a><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Obviously you can vary the vegetable combination in this pudding, depending on the season and what you might have as leftovers. Parboiled zucchini, cubed cooked artichoke hearts, cooked oyster plant or any vegetable that is not too moist can be included. Minced parsley and/or dill can be added to the sauce before the vegetables are stirred in, as can a little grated onion or lemon rind.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_9"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>LEIPZIG MIXED VEGETABLES (Leipziger Allerlei)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">Leipzig, in the eastern province of Saxony, is a city of great cultural associations—the birthplace of Wagner and a musical center where Bach composed much of his work. It was also noted for its many booksellers and for the following mixed-vegetable combination that is served all over Germany. The Leipzig “variety” contains a combination of vegetables that may vary from season to season and from one cook to another. I do not remember ever seeing a recipe for it that did not include carrots, kohlrabi and green peas, usually cauliflower, often asparagus and, occasionally, mushrooms. Cabbage may also be used, but no other leaf vegetables are ever part of the mixture; neither are such “fruit” vegetables as tomatoes, squash or peppers. Celery and parsley roots may be included and once or twice I have been served this Allerlei with string beans in it. Now that I’ve said all that, I have no doubt that on your first day in Germany you will come face to face with some Feinschmecker who will insist that if it contains kohlrabi and carrots and not string beans or mushrooms, it may be an Allerlei but it’s certainly not Leipziger. It’s one of those dishes—along with bouillabaisse, paella and Sauerbraten. The following combination is my favorite, but you can change it to suit yourself and the season.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">4 TO 6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 small young carrots</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 or 3 medium-sized kohlrabi</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 cup green peas (about 1 pound in shells)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ head cauliflower</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ pound asparagus (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ pound small white mushrooms</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 large onion, minced (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 to 1½ cups vegetable stock</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt to taste</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>white pepper to taste</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>minced parsley</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">All vegetables should be washed and trimmed, scraped or peeled, as necessary. Carrots should be sliced or cut in julienne strips; kohlrabi in <a id="page265"></a>matchstick strips; cauliflower in flowerets; asparagus in 1” to 2” lengths; mushrooms sliced and sautéed in butter 3 or 4 minutes along with a little lemon juice. Cook each vegetable separately in just enough lightly salted water. Drain well and combine all vegetable stock. Sauté mushrooms in a little butter with lemon juice but do not mix with other vegetables.</p>

  <p class="indent">Heat butter in a saucepan or casserole; when hot and bubbling, add onion if you are using it. I find that it gives the vegetables a rich and savory touch; others think it too overpowering. If you use onion, fry slowly until it becomes golden brown, then sprinkle with flour. If you do not use onion, sprinkle flour into hot butter. Stir and sauté flour slowly about 6 minutes, or until the color of cocoa. Add 1 cup vegetable stock and stir until smooth with a wire whisk or wooden spoon over low heat. Simmer sauce 5 minutes, adding more vegetable liquid if it becomes too thick. Season to taste with salt, pepper and parsley. Add vegetables and mushrooms to sauce and heat through slowly. In northern Germany, Crab Butter, is often stirred into this sauce or used instead of plain butter for making the Einbrenne; crayfish tails or shrimp may also be added as a garnish.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_10"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>ARTICHOKES (Artischocken)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">These are usually served just as they are in the U.S.—steamed or boiled, hot or cold. To wash and prepare artichokes, cut off stem end flat, so bottoms can stand on a plate. Remove tough or spotted outer leaves and trim thistles off leaf tips. Soak in cold water 5 to 10 minutes and drain. To cook, place artichokes upright in a deep saucepan, close together so they hold each other up, but do not cram them too tightly. Add 2” to 3” boiling water to the pot, 1 tablespoon vinegar and a little salt. Cover pot and steam slowly but steadily 25 to 35 minutes, depending on size of artichokes. An artichoke is done when a leaf can be plucked out easily. Turn upside down to drain. Melted butter or Hollandaise Sauce, is served with hot artichokes. If you want to serve them chilled, use Vinaigrette Herb Dressing. Artichoke bottoms are often served as hot or cold appetizers in Germany. Cook as above and when done remove all leaves and the choke.</p>

  <p class="indent">To prepare cold stuffed artichoke bottoms, fill with Meat Salad, piling the salad up in an attractive peak and masking it with mayonnaise. Set on a salad plate and surround with a ring of mayonnaise. Garnish with lettuce, tomatoes, pickled gherkins, etc.</p>

  <p class="indent">To prepare hot stuffed artichoke bottoms, fill each with Creamed Mushrooms, to which you can add a little sautéed minced onion, or minced cooked ham, if you like. Top with a sprinkling of <a id="page266"></a>breadcrumbs, dot with butter and bake until brown in the upper third of a 475° oven.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_11"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>ASPARAGUS (Spargel oder Stangenspargel)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">This delectable vegetable is recognized as one of the most welcome signs of spring in just about every country in the Western world, and Germany is no exception. The tender, mildly flavored ivory asparagus of Schwetzingen are the most highly prized in that country, and, along with rose-pink salmon, new potatoes and the first tiny strawberries, herald the arrival of Frühling am Rhein—spring on the Rhine, usually the first place it presents itself in Germany.</p>

  <p class="indent">The Germans like asparagus most of all with ham, but they often eat it with smoked salmon, or with one of the toppings that follow here. Asparagus also flavor many chicken and shellfish stews and salads, while leftovers are generally used for omelettes or a vegetable pudding such as the one.</p>

  <p class="indent">To prepare asparagus, snap off tough ends with your fingers; do not cut off with a knife. Scale off any tough skin that remains near the bottom with a sharp, thin paring knife. Wash asparagus well under running cold water. The tough ends and skin can be washed and used to make a soup stock. Asparagus may be steamed or boiled in bundles, on a rack, or, if you go in for such specialized equipment, in an asparagus steamer. The simplest method is to cook them in a large, deep skillet that has a tight-fitting cover. Place washed, trimmed asparagus in boiling water to which you add a little salt and, for a real German touch, a pinch of sugar as well. Cook rapidly just 5 or 6 minutes. They should retain their bright green color and be slightly firm to the teeth, though tender when pierced with a sharp-pointed knife. Remove from water immediately with slotted pancake turner or tongs and drain before adding sauce.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>SAUCES AND TOPPINGS FOR COOKED ASPARAGUS:</strong></p>

  <p class="indent">Melted butter, plain or with breadcrumbs browned in the butter.</p>

  <p class="indent">Grated lemon rind may be sprinkled over the breadcrumbs.</p>

  <p class="indent">Chopped hazelnuts or blanched, slivered almonds, browned in butter.</p>

  <p class="indent">Hollandaise Sauce.</p>

  <p class="indent">Fine Mustard Sauce.</p>

  <p class="indent">White Sauce, is a great favorite in southern Germany. Use asparagus stock and milk for the liquid and flavor with nutmeg. Egg yolk, cream and lemon juice generally finish this sauce. Minced cooked ham is sometimes added, in which case the dish becomes Asparagus in Ham-Cream (Spargel in Schinkencreme).</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">4 GENEROUS SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 pounds asparagus, cooked as described in above recipe</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 tablespoons butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 tablespoons flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¾ cup asparagus stock</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¾ cup Rhine wine</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 egg yolks beaten into ¼ cup sweet cream</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt to taste</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>sugar to taste</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Drain asparagus well and keep warm on heated covered platter. Do not leave asparagus in cooking water while you prepare sauce. Heat butter in a saucepan and when it is hot and bubbling, stir in flour. Stir until flour just begins to take on color, about 4 minutes. Add asparagus stock and beat with a wire whisk or wooden spoon, over low heat, until sauce is smooth and thick. Simmer 5 minutes, then stir in wine and mix until smoothly blended. Bring sauce to a boil once, then remove from heat. Add a little hot sauce to the egg-yolk-cream mixture, then turn that back slowly into the rest of the sauce. Stir and heat if necessary, but do not boil. Flavor with salt and sugar as needed and serve over asparagus.</p>

  <h3 class="section" id="heading_id_16"><img alt="" src="../Images/Sher_9780307754578_epub_L02_r1.jpg" />&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<a id="page268"></a><em>BEETS (Rote Rühen)</em></h3>

  <p class="nonindent">Usually beets are served cold and pickled, as described. However, they are often eaten hot. To preserve their color, flavor and vitamins, they are cooked without being peeled. The leaves should be cut off, but about 2” to 3” of stem should be left on so beets do not “bleed” as they cook. If the leaves are young and tender they can be cooked separately in the same way as spinach. Scrub beets well with a stiff brush; wash under cold running water. Cook cleaned beets in boiling salted water to cover, until tender when pierced with a fork or skewer or, in Germany, with a knitting needle. Small beets will be done in about 30 minutes; large ones in 1 to 1½ hours. Drain and cool slightly before peeling; the skins will slip off easily.

  <p class="nonindent">Both Kohl and Kraut denote cabbage in Germany, although strictly speaking they are not synonymous. Kohl is cabbage, and everything in that family is some kind of Kohl. Cauliflower is Blumenkohl, or flower cabbage; kale is Grünkohl, or Braunkohl, because it is green raw but darkens to a brownish color when cooked; common white cabbage is Weisskohl; winter cabbage is Winterkohl; red cabbage is Rotkohl, while curly, mild-flavored savoy is Wirsing. Brussels sprouts are rose cabbage, Rosenkohl; the name Kohlrabi denotes the vegetable that is half cabbage, half turnip. Kraut, literally, is a purée or concentration of any fruit or vegetable; shredded cabbage is Kraut. When shredded cabbage is pickled or sour, it becomes sauerkraut. The cabbage family is far and away the favorite vegetable group in Germany and there are an enormous number of recipes for each variety. It is so popular, in fact, that many sayings and maxims are based on it. “An old story” in Germany is “aufgewärmter Kohl” (warmed-over cabbage), and the English expression, “fair words butter no parsnips,” becomes in German <em>schöne Worte <a id="page270"></a>machen den Kohl nicht fett</em>—pretty words do not make the cabbage fat. A person who is something of a blockhead is a Kohlkopf—cabbage head, and that is the only derogatory statement Germans ever make concerning their favorite vegetable.</p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>vinegar to taste</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Remove tough outer leaves from cabbage. Cut head in quarters and wash well. Remove center stalk and trim off heavy spiny ribs. Bring water to a boil, add a little salt and the cabbage. Cover and simmer over moderate heat about 10 minutes, or until tender. Remove from pot and drain well, reserving cooking stock. Grind through a food chopper, or chop by hand and drain again. Heat butter in a 2-quart saucepan and when it is hot and bubbling, add onion. Sauté slowly, stirring, until onion turns deep golden brown. Sprinkle flour over onion. Continue stirring and sautéing over low heat until flour becomes color of cocoa. Do this slowly and carefully so that onion and flour do not burn and blacken. Pour in 2 cups of cabbage liquid and beat smooth with a wire whisk or wooden spoon. Season sauce with salt, pepper and, if you like, a dash of vinegar. Add chopped cabbage to sauce, cover and simmer 5 to 10 minutes.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. For Savoy Cabbage in White Sauce, follow recipe but when cabbage has been cooked, chopped and drained, use its cooking stock to make White Sauce. Onion may be used or eliminated. Finish sauce with a dash of cream. In southern Germany, some minced fresh chives and ½ teaspoon meat extract are added to this cream sauce.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. Any of the recipes for savoy cabbage can be applied to white cabbage, kale, broccoli or Brussels sprouts. Adjust cooking time according to type of cabbage being used. White cabbage should be shredded raw or chopped after it is cooked. Broccoli should be cooked and then chopped or cut in flowerets. Brussels sprouts may be whole if small, otherwise cut in half when raw, or chopped after they are cooked. Kale can be cooked in leaves, then chopped. Any of these can be combined or mixed with kohlrabi.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">When cooked properly, red cabbage is known as Blaukraut—blue kraut—because of the deep purple color it takes on. This is due to the hot vinegar and fat in which the cabbage is braised before water or stock is added. If you skip that initial step, the cabbage will “bleed” as it cooks and you will have the faded pink, oversoft concoction that gives red cabbage a bad name. It tastes best when made a day in advance.</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="nonindent">The table was set, and I have found<br />
    the good old German flavor.<br />
    You greeted me, my Sauerkraut,<br />
    With your most charming savor.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">No less a poet than Heinrich Heine wrote the above ode to that most German of German vegetables—sauerkraut. If it has been badly maligned, it is due to the soggy, overcooked versions of it we get too often in German restaurants or hot-dog stands. When prepared properly and well seasoned, it is a succulent and tempting vegetable. Ideally, sauerkraut should be cooked to a stage known as “dry but juicy,” the kraut itself being moist but with no soupy sauce around it. To achieve that result, sauté the sauerkraut first in hot fat, then cook very slowly in a little water or stock in a heavy casserole or Dutch oven, adding more liquid if needed. The kraut sauce can then be bound in any of the ways indicated in the following recipes. Seasonings vary from place to place; juniper is always used in Swabia, caraway seeds may be, apple and onion almost always are. When sauerkraut needs an elegant touch it gets it via pineapple, wine or even champagne.</p>

  <p class="indent">The best sauerkraut to buy is the kind that comes in big wooden barrels and is sold in delicatessens and appetizing stores. However, sauerkraut packed in plastic bags or cans can also be fairly good, but find a brand that is not too soft. Both of these will probably be more sour, and need more washing, than the fresh barreled kraut. In addition to these recipes, sauerkraut is also eaten cold and raw—as is—as a sort of pickle relish or condiment with meat dishes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Since sauerkraut is shredded raw cabbage that has been pickled in salt, it has a high acid content. Therefore, it is best to cook it in a glass or enameled pot—a must if you plan to add wine or vinegar.</p>

  <p class="hr">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">6 TO 8 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 pounds or 2 quarts sauerkraut, fresh or canned</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>4 tablespoons rendered lard, goose fat or finely minced bacon, or butter if you prefer it</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 large onion, minced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 medium-sized apples, peeled, cored and chopped</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 to 4 cups stock or water, as needed</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>6 or 8 juniper berries (optional), or 1 tablespoon caraway seeds (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon flour dissolved in a little cold water, or 1 large raw potato, peeled</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt to taste</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Drain sauerkraut in a colander, pressing out excess liquid. If it is very sour, rinse once or twice in the colander until the flavor is mild; press out excess water. Heat fat or melt bacon in an enameled Dutch oven or casserole; when hot, add onion and apple and sauté slowly until golden brown. Add sauerkraut, stir until mixed with fat, cover and braise over very low heat 10 minutes. Add enough stock to half-cover sauerkraut. Add juniper berries or caraway seeds if you are using either. Cover and simmer slowly but steadily ½ to 2 hours, or until sauerkraut is soft but not overcooked. Add more liquid to pot as needed during cooking. To thicken sauce, stir in flour blended with water and simmer 3 or 4 minutes. I find that the potato makes a richer, more flavorful thickening. It should be grated into sauerkraut the last 20 minutes or so of cooking time. Check to see if more liquid is needed as sauce thickens. Season to taste. It is a good idea to make sauerkraut the day before you want to serve it and store in the refrigerator overnight, as its flavor will improve.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. Wine Kraut (Weinkraut): Apples and caraway seeds or juniper berries may be used or eliminated. After sauerkraut is sautéed, add ¾ cup dry white wine or apple wine and just enough water or stock to half cover kraut. Proceed with cooking, adding a dash of wine for extra flavor at the end.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. Hungarian Sauerkraut (Ungarisches Sauerkraut): Eliminate apples and jumper berries, but use caraway seeds if you like. Sauté 1 tablespoon sweet paprika along with onion. Lard or bacon are the fats normally used for this. Cook sauerkraut. To thicken, stir 3 tablespoons flour into 1 cup sour cream and add to sauce. Stir into sauerkraut and simmer 10 minutes. Season with salt and a pinch of sugar if necessary.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. Pineapple Kraut (Ananaskraut) : This is made the same way except that it is thickened. Add 1 #2 can cubed drained pineapple to cooked kraut; stir in and heat together 15 or 20 minutes.<a id="page277"></a></p>

  <p class="nonindent">4 Champagne Kraut (Sektkraut): Substitute champagne for water or stock. Or the washed and drained kraut can simply be covered with champagne and cooked in it, without any fat or thickening being added. I like the sauerkraut sautéed in butter, then cooked in champagne without onion, apple or other such flavorings. You can mix ½ cup crushed, drained canned pineapple into cooked kraut and heat through before serving, or finish with an extra dash of champagne.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">5. Wine Kraut, Lorraine Style (Lothringer Weinkraut) : Use rendered goose fat for braising, and cook kraut in white wine without adding any other liquid. Add 8 juniper berries and 3 whole cloves. Do not bind sauce but finish with ¼ to ½ cup brandy and simmer 3 or 4 minutes before serving.</p>

Drain off excess liquid and season to taste. Cool completely.</p>

  <p class="indent">Spread the cooled, drained sauerkraut over the sheets of dough and sprinkle with the ground or chopped smoked ham or pork loin. Roll sheets carefully, jelly-roll style. Cut in pieces about 3 fingers wide, as you would for Strudel. Flatten slightly with your hand so each piece has two wide flat sides. Heat butter or lard in a shallow casserole or baking dish that has a cover. Add Strudel pieces, side by side in a single layer, without crowding into pan. Brown on both sides in hot fat, turning once gently with a wooden spatula. When brown, add just enough water or stock to cover bottom of pan. Cover and braise in a 375° oven or on the stove about ½ hour, or until dough bakes through. Add more liquid to pan if necessary. If you would like a sauce for this, remove finished Strudel from pan to a heated platter. Stir paprika into pan juices and then add sour cream. Heat but do not boil, then spoon over Strudels.</p>

  <p class="indent">NOTE</p>

  <p class="nonindent">If you would like to serve this as an appetizer, make strudeis half the size; this amount will give you enough for a dozen people.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Steamed or boiled carrots, either whole, sliced or diced, are most often served with melted butter to which some minced parsley or dill has been added. They are also served in a White Sauce, made with their own stock, which might be flavored with a dash of sugar and again, minced parsley or dill. Onion would not be used in that sauce, nor would it be thickened with egg yolk; finish it off with a little milk or sweet cream.</p>

  <p class="indent">Diced carrots mixed with peas, buttered or in white sauce, are also favorites in Germany; the less said about them the better, here or there.</p>

  <p class="indent">Whole glazed carrots are attractive garnishes for roasts and pot roasts. To prepare, scrape and cook carrots in salted water. Drain well and reserve stock. For 4 or 5 carrots, melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet and when it is hot, stir in 1 tablespoon sugar. Sauté slowly until sugar turns a golden caramel color but do not let it burn. Add 1 cup carrot stock, stir, then add carrots. Cover skillet and simmer slowly but steadily until liquid evaporates. Shake pan frequently during cooking until carrots are evenly glazed on all sides.</p>

Kohlrabi have a spiny, threadlike cover that must be peeled off before being cooked. As this outer skin separates itself easily from the white inner meat, the job of peeling is a simple one. If they are small, they may be cooked in halves or quarters, though usually this vegetable is cut in matchstick strips or diced. Kohlrabi are sold in bunches, usually 4 or 5 in each.

  <p class="nonindent">This delicately flavored root vegetable is extremely popular throughout Germany, and is prepared with melted butter and breadcrumbs, au gratin, fried or creamed. It is also mixed with other vegetables and added to stews. Its name in German means “black root,” and that is a clue to the main problem in preparing it. Once it is scraped, this long thin snow-white vegetable turns black almost instantly. To avoid that, it must immediately be plunged into cold water that has lemon juice or vinegar added to it, or a tablespoonful or two of flour mixed in with it. Acidulate the water with lemon or vinegar and mix in the flour. Drain the cleaned and cut oyster plant just before cooking. Simmer in fresh clear lightly salted water.

  <p class="nonindent">These sweet white-root vegetables are most often used to flavor soups and braised meats. However, they are also served as a vegetable. Scrape as you would carrots, or peel thinly and wash. They may be cooked whole, sliced, diced or cut in half lengthwise, though it is best to cook whole and cut them when done. Simmer in just enough salted water to cover. A whole parsnip will be done in about ½ hour. Drain when tender and serve with melted butter, with or without breadcrumbs, creamed, <a id="page289"></a>baked or fried, or in crisp savory cakes, as below. Allow one large parsnip for each serving.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Stuffed vegetables, such as tomatoes, cucumbers, kohlrabi, cabbage, zucchini and peppers, are often served for dinner in German homes. <a id="page294"></a>They are simple to prepare, are economical and provide a change in the standard meat and vegetable theme. The three main stuffings follow, but the variety is quite endless. All of these are very good when reheated and so can be cooked a day or two ahead of time. If the filling does not contain meat, one small stuffed vegetable often is served as an appetizer, usually hot, but in the case of rice stuffing, sometimes cold.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>BREAD FILLING</strong> <em>(Semmelfüllung)</em></p>

Heat butter in a skillet and sauté onion and parsley slowly until soft and onion is transparent. For a stronger flavor, brown onion first, then stir in parsley for a minute or two. Mix well into soaked bread. Add one beaten egg and one tablespoonful cream at a time, until mixture is moist but not too soft. Other herbs can be mixed in according to taste. Stuff vegetables according to specific recipes.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 cups well-seasoned meat or chicken stock</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon minced parsley</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">If rice is converted or otherwise processed, it needs no washing or cleaning. If you are lucky enough to be able to get absolutely raw rice, clean by rubbing grains until glossy between two layers of clean kitchen toweling. Heat butter in a 1- to ½-quart heavy saucepan or casserole and when hot and bubbling, add onion. Stir and sauté over low heat until soft and yellow. Add rice and stir until well coated with butter. Stir and fry rice over low heat about 5 minutes, or until grains become glassy. Bring stock to a boil and pour over rice. Cover, bring to a boil and reduce heat until sauce is simmering very slowly but steadily. Cook until rice is tender, anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes, depending on the type you use. Add more liquid if necessary during cooking but do not raise lid too often. Do not stir rice as it cooks or it will become pasty. Rice should be tender and grains separate.

  <p class="nonindent">Cabbage is stuffed in three different ways in Germany, always with some version of a meat filling. It may be formed into rolls, baked as a pudding with alternate layers of meat and cabbage leaves, or the head may be stuffed whole. The last method sounds much better than it looks when served. The stuffing is spooned between the leaves of green or savoy cabbage, the head is tied together and the whole thing is steamed until done. However, once you cut this apart to serve it, you have nothing but a pile of cabbage leaves with meat tumbling around them. I have, therefore, not included this version here. When preparing the filling for cabbage, rice is generally used instead of the alternate potato or bread.</p>

  <p class="right"><a id="page296"></a><span class="small">ABOUT 6 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 2-pound head of cabbage</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>water to cover</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>twice the recipe for Meat Filling</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>Tomato, Anchovy or Bacon Sauce</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">With a thin sharp pointed paring knife, carefully cut the core out of the cabbage head. This will loosen the leaves so they can be removed easily. Remove leaves individually as gently as you can so they do not break. Wash under running water. Stack leaves on top of each other in a deep pot, cover with water, add a little salt and cook about 10 minutes, until half done. Drain and let leaves cool slightly. Place on a board and very carefully trim thick portion of ribs off backs.</p>

  <p class="indent">Prepare filling, using rice. Butter a baking dish with tight-fitting cover, or use a pudding mold. Place a layer of cabbage leaves on the bottom, then half the meat, another layer of cabbage, the rest of the meat and, finally, the remaining cabbage leaves. Or you could start with a layer of half the cabbage leaves, add all the meat and top with remaining cabbage which has been shredded. Cover dish or mold and set in a larger pot. Add enough hot water to come halfway up sides of dish or mold. Steam 1 to ½ hours, until done. Serve with one of the sauces suggested above.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 small onion studded with 6 cloves</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>¼ cup sweet or sour cream</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 tablespoon tomato purée</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt and pepper to taste</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">For this dish, use only the large outer leaves. Smaller inside leaves can be reserved for another use, or can be shredded and cooked along with <a id="page297"></a>cabbage rolls. Prepare and cook leaves as directed in above recipe. Be extra careful about trimming ribs, as it is even more important for leaves to be intact for this. Cook leaves 7 or 8 minutes. Some of the smaller ones can be cooked also, to piece out rolls should that be necessary.</p>

  <p class="indent">Prepare filling with rice rather than potato or bread. When leaves have been drained and trimmed, lay out flat. Place 1 generous tablespoonful of stuffing at rib end of leaf. Roll from the rib end to the tip, tucking sides in as you go along. These rolls can be tied together, but if you can handle them gently, that is not strictly necessary. Heat butter or bacon fat in a deep Dutch oven or casserole and when it is hot, add rolls. Brown on all sides over moderate heat, turning very gently if they have not been tied. Add stock and onion with cloves. Cover pot and simmer slowly but steadily 1 to ½ hours, or until meat is done. (You will have to cut through one test roll to be sure.) Remove onion from sauce. Dissolve flour in sweet or sour cream and stir into hot but not boiling sauce. Add tomato purée and simmer about 5 minutes, adjusting seasoning to taste.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. A tablespoonful of paprika can be added to the rolls as they are browning.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. The rolls may braise in a 375° oven instead of on the stove. Check to see if more liquid is needed in pan during baking.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">3. Sweet-and-Sour Cabbage Rolls (Pikante Kohlrouladen): This unusual but not unknown version was a favorite of my grandmother’s and met with unqualified success whenever she served it. I suspect it originated around Nürnberg, where Lebkuchen are so often used in cooking, or it might reflect the Rhinelanders’ love of raisins and a sweet-sour sauce. Prepare and stuff cabbage leaves. It is not necessary to tie them or brown in fat. Place in a deep pot or kettle and cover completely with beef stock or water. Add the clove-studded onion, 1 bay leaf, juice of 1 lemon, 2 tablespoons brown sugar and 3 to 4 tablespoons tomato purée. Cover and simmer slowly but steadily 1 hour. Add ½ cup unsoaked raisins and 8 or 9 crushed Lebkuchen or gingersnaps and simmer again 15 minutes. Stir sauce once in a while to keep it smooth and add more stock if it seems too thick. (As an alternate to the crushed cookies, thicken the sauce with an Einbrenne made by sautéing 2 tablespoons flour until brown in 3 tablespoons butter, bacon fat or lard and adding to sauce.) Arrange cooked cabbage rolls in a single layer in an open baking pan that is at least 3” to 4” deep. Check sauce for seasoning, adding salt and more lemon juice and/or sugar to give a sweet-sour flavor. Pour sauce into baking pan, covering cabbage rolls completely. Bake in 375° oven 30 to 40 minutes, or until sauce is thick and rolls are browned.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Wash and dry tomatoes. Cut lid off top and reserve. Gently scoop out seeds and juice. Salt lightly inside and out and fill with stuffing. It should not be packed in too tightly. Replace tops as lids. Butter a deep baking dish and stand tomatoes in it. Bake in preheated oven, 375° for rice, 450° for cheese. Bake 15 minutes; remove tomato lids for last 5 minutes <a id="page299"></a>of cooking time. If rice is used, sprinkle tops with grated cheese when you remove lids.</p>

  <p class="indent">Tomatoes stuffed with meat can be prepared the same way, using leftover meat for the recipe and allowing 5 extra minutes of baking time before removing tomato lids. Raw meat takes too long to cook for tomatoes, which would fall apart by the time the filling was done. If you do start with raw meat, sauté in butter or oil, then proceed with filling.</p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>8 medium-sized green peppers</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>Meat Filling or Rice Filling</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons flour dissolved in a little cold water (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>½ cup sweet cream</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">The peppers should be as perfect as possible and equal in size. Wash and dry and cut lid off top. Remove seeds and white fibers from inside shell. Rinse insides, dry and sprinkle lightly with salt. Fill to the brim but do not pack stuffing too tightly. Cover with lids. Heat butter or bacon fat in a deep casserole and stand peppers upright in hot fat. Cover pan and braise about 10 minutes, adding a little liquid to cover the bottom of the pan if the fat is burning or the peppers scorching. After 10 minutes add enough stock to half-cover peppers. Cover and simmer about 20 to 30 minutes or until almost done. Add tomatoes or purée and simmer, covered, again for 10 minutes.

  <p class="indent2"><strong>VARIATION</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">When no cream is added to sauce, peppers can be prepared with a slightly sweet-and-sour flavor. Add ½ a small bay leaf to stock along with tomatoes. Before sauce has its final simmering, flavor with about 1 tablespoon each sugar and lemon juice.</p>

  <p class="right"><span class="small">6 TO 8 SERVINGS</span></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 cups white beans, yellow or green split peas or whole dried green peas, or lentils (i scant pound)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>water to cover</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>pinch of baking soda, if necessary</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>salt</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 large carrot, diced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 stalks celery, sliced, or ½ knob celery, peeled and sliced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 leek, sliced (optional)</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>3 to 4 tablespoons minced bacon, lard or butter</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>1 large onion, minced</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons flour</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>vinegar to taste, for lentils</em></p>

  <p class="hanging"><em>2 tablespoons tomato purée, for white beans</em></p>

  <p class="hanging1"><em>pinch of marjoram, optional for peas</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">If necessary, soak beans, peas or lentils overnight in water to cover with pinch of baking soda. Some dried legumes are treated so that they do not have to be soaked. Follow instructions on package. To cook, cover with water and add a little salt along with carrot and celery, and leek if you use it. Cover and cook slowly until tender but not mushy, about 45 minutes to 1 hour for treated legumes, longer for the old-fashioned kind. Heat fat in a skillet and when hot and bubbling, add onion. Sauté slowly, stirring, over low heat, until onion is a rich golden brown. Add flour and sauté until it becomes a medium brown cocoa color. Stir flour and onions into legumes, bring to a boil slowly and simmer until thickened. Check seasoning, adding vinegar to lentils, tomato purée to beans, and marjoram to peas.</p>

  <p class="indent">White beans are always served whole. Lentils are served whole or puréed.</p>

  <p class="indent2"><strong>PEA PURÉE</strong> <em>(Erbsenpüree)</em></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Peas, whether yellow or green, split or whole, are always puréed; this should be done before adding onion-flour thickening. Stir in, heat and stir until smooth, and season to taste. Garnishes vary. You can top any of these with bits of crumbled crisp bacon or minced parsley.</p>

  <p class="indent">The yellow purée is a standard with Berlin’s Eisbein, and in Swabia with sauerkraut, fried fresh liver sausage and Spätzle. Pea purée is almost always topped with onion rings, that have been sautéed golden brown in butter, and toasted breadcrumbs. The pea purée, after being thickened, is turned out into a shallow buttered baking dish, topped with onions, melted butter and breadcrumbs and baked in a 350° oven for 20 minutes, or until there is a rich brown crust on top.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page302"></a><strong>VARIATIONS</strong></p>

  <p class="nonindent">1. In some parts of Germany, 1 clove sliced garlic is substituted for onion when thickening sauce. Browned bits of garlic can also be used to top split pea purée if none is in purée itself.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">2. Any of these legumes become one-pot meals if you cook frankfurter-type wurst in them. Brown the wurst first in a skillet for richer flavor. If large, such as knockwurst, slice in i”-thick pieces; otherwise add smaller wursts whole.</p>
