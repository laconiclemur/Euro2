    <p class="nonindent1_break"><a id="page181"/><span class="C_COTX"><span class="dk_blue">Most visitors to Iceland</span></span> who don’t venture beyond the lava fields surrounding Reykjavík on their way to such nearby tourist hot spots as the waterfall of <a id="ind281a"/>Gullfoss or the geysers of <a id="ind257a"/>Geysir National Park assume the country is a land of jagged black volcanic rock with sparse stands of trees heroically growing in the shadow of soaring mountains. They would never guess that eastern Iceland boasts vast green forests and a bountiful sun that rarely finds its way to Reykjavík. This is the land that reminds Icelanders of what once existed in many parts of the country before the trees were felled by their ancestors to build wooden houses.</p>
<p class="extract"><a id="ind67a"/>Birch, the national tree of Iceland, grows in abundance in the eastern forests. Its sap was once a staple for Icelanders, who boiled it down to syrup in the same way that maple sap is processed in the United States. The tradition has long been lost, save for a few stalwarts who never forgot the importance of birch on the Icelandic table.</p>
<p class="extract">Today, <a id="ind66a"/>Bergrún Arna Thorsteinsdóttir sells birch syrup, mushrooms, and other traditional Icelandic culinary products through her company <a id="ind312a"/>Holt og Heidar. The <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-s55">birch schnapps and liqueur company</a> that Gunnar and a partner founded in 2009 uses birch for infusing their spirits from Bergrún, adding a birch twig to every bottle.</p>
<p class="extract">As she wanders through the lush green forests of eastern Iceland, Bergrún taps birch trees and forages for mushrooms. It is another country altogether from the mossy lava fields of the west, reminding Icelanders who visit the area of what their ancestors likely experienced as they inhaled the oxygen-rich air of the forests. Her company’s products are an easy way to transport the past into the contemporary Icelandic kitchen. They are an edible reminder of what once was, and if conservation and reforestation efforts succeed, a symbol of what can be again.</p>
<h2 class="A2" id="c08-s57"><a id="page182"/><span class="dk_blue">A Conversation with Birch and Mushroom Forager Bergrún Arna Thorsteinsdóttir</span></h2>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> How do you make your birch syrup and other products?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">It requires 125 liters of birch sap to make a single liter of birch syrup. The process is very labor-intensive and calls for a tremendous amount of raw ingredients. We add 25 percent sugar to each jar of birch syrup that we sell. Otherwise, the tannins are so bitter that the syrup would not appeal to the consumer. Making birch syrup was a tradition that disappeared centuries ago, but we are trying to revive it. Last year we produced 300 kilograms [660 pounds] of birch syrup, and this year we hope to produce even more.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Whom do you sell your products to?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">We used to sell them only in Iceland, but now there is interest abroad, and we have started selling our products to Norway, with other countries hopefully on the horizon. Tourists seem very interested in what we make, and more and more Icelanders are interested in what we do, too. That makes me happy, because it is their heritage that we are trying to preserve.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> How much land do you use to produce your products?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">We are allowed to use the entire birch forest as long as we use it responsibly. We are very conscientious and do not exploit the forest in any way. We replant seedlings to replace the trees that we take, and tapping the trees for sap does no harm to them. We do everything here in a sustainable way, because we have learned lessons from the past. Our ancestors deforested much of Iceland for their timber needs, and today we consider these forests to be precious and deserving of protection.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Have you tried Gunnar’s liqueur and schnapps?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">Yes, I like them very much. It’s nice to see our birch transformed into something so beautiful. We had been trying to make birch juice, but it wasn’t working out. When we were contacted about using our birch to make spirits, we were excited to see if someone else could make a go of infusing liquids with birch, and we are happy that it was a success.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> <a id="page183"/><a id="ind387a"/>How many people do you employ?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">There are only two of us, and then we have seasonal workers throughout the year to help us. We tap trees beginning around April, and once it begins, it lasts for about three weeks. It’s a short season and we need to move quickly to obtain as much sap as we can.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Do you handle other Icelandic ingredients in addition to the birch?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">Yes, we also collect mushrooms and sell them both dried and fresh. We harvest berries and sell them fresh or turn them into jams and juices. The same goes for rhubarb. We try to use as many of Iceland’s natural products as we can to show people just how delicious and special they are.</p>

<p class="Essays_header"><span class="dk_blue">VISITING EASTERN ICELAND</span></p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">Eastern Iceland is one of the farthest locations to visit from Reykjavík, but the few days of driving time or the hour-long plane ride you must undertake to get there is well worth it. <a id="ind205a"/>Egilsstadir, the largest town of the region, is not far from the lush birch forests and large barley farm of <a id="ind631a"/>Vallanes, where owner <a id="ind219a"/>Eymundur Magnússon is always happy to welcome visitors to his little piece of Icelandic heaven on the shores of picturesque <a id="ind341a"/><a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c06_r1.htm#c06-s39">Lake Lagarfljót</a>. It is said that a monster similar to the one in Loch Ness surfaces every so often in the lake, so keep your eyes open for a sighting.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">The region boasts many guesthouse, hotel, and cozy cabin accommodations, perfect base camps for the horseback riding, river rafting, and hiking opportunities that abound in the area. South of Egilsstadir, along a shoreline drive that will leave you mesmerized by the natural beauty of its waterfalls, cliffs, and soaring mountains, is Iceland’s largest glacier, <a id="ind633a"/>Vatnajökull, which covers 8 percent of the country.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">Here is where you can view (even take a boat ride through) the massive turquoise blue icebergs that have broken off from the glacier and are making their way out to sea. This is also the area where <a id="ind491a"/>reindeer herds roam freely. They are plentiful, and should you be watching for their velvet antlers on the horizon, you are very likely to spot some.</p>

<div class="headnote">Gunnar’s <a id="ind193a"/>tableside presentations at Dill are sometimes dramatic affairs that are as beautiful as his food is exquisite, and this recipe is a nice illustration of that quality. The marrow is smoked over onion peels, a technique explained <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c10_r1.htm#c10-s74">Dried Vegetable Peels</a>. When served tableside directly from the oven, the striking contrast of the long pieces of halved bone, bubbling from caramelization, resting on a bed of onion peels and accompanied with red and yellow beets, yields a riot of colors that elicits gasps of appreciation from the diners. Another version of this dish calls for smoking the marrowbones over a bed of dried birch leaves, an option that is just as striking, and perfect for a brisk autumn day. The beet–cherry vinegar puree and the red and yellow beets are the ideal chromatic counterpoints for an enticing dish you will want to make again and again.</div>

<p class="IL_item"><strong>¼ cup (60 ml) water</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>2½ tablespoons sugar</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1 sprig rosemary</strong></p>
<p class="IL_head"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>BEET–CHERRY VINEGAR PUREE</strong></span></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>¾ cup (180 ml) cherry or raspberry vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1¾ cups (420 ml) freshly squeezed red beet juice (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c08_r1.htm#c08-note34">see notes</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1 cup (200 g) sugar</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1½ teaspoons powdered agar agar (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-note18">see note</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Salt</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">To make the smoked bone marrow, season the marrowbones with salt. Arrange the onion peels on the bottom of a deep hotel pan or similar vessel lined with foil and place over high heat. Evenly arrange the bones in a perforated hotel pan that fits inside the first pan. Ignite the peels with a kitchen torch, top with the perforated pan, and seal the entire set-up securely with aluminum foil. Allow the smoke to smolder out completely, about 30 minutes, before removing the foil.</div>
<div class="method">To make the beets, cut the yellow and red beets into planks 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. Using a round cutter ½ inch (12 mm) in diameter, cut each plank to yield a cylinder ½ inch (12 mm) in diameter and 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. Bring a saucepan of salted water to a boil, add the yellow cylinders, and cook for 5 to 5½ minutes, until just tender. Using a slotted <a id="page190"/>spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain. Repeat the process with the red cylinders. Place each color in a separate heatproof bowl (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c08_r1.htm#c08-note34">see notes</a>).</div>
<div class="method">Combine the vinegar, water, sugar, and rosemary in a saucepan and bring to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat, discard the rosemary, and pour half of the liquid over the red cylinders and half over the yellow cylinders. Let stand at room temperature for 3 hours before using, or cover and refrigerate until ready to use.</div>
<div class="method">To make the beet–cherry vinegar puree, combine the vinegar, half of the red beet juice, and the sugar in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat, add the agar agar, and process with an immersion blender until smooth. Season with salt, then return to low heat and cook, stirring, for about 1 minute, until the mixture starts to thicken. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a small heatproof bowl and let cool to room temperature. It will be the texture and thickness of fluid gel.</div>
<div class="method">Transfer the mixture to a blender and process on high speed, adding the remaining beet juice in a slow, steady stream. Continue to process until the puree is the consistency of a glossy gel. Transfer to a squeeze bottle and refrigerate until chilled. The puree will keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.</div>
<div class="method">Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Once you have removed the foil, finish the marrow in the oven for 2 minutes. Finally, caramelize the surface of the marrow with a kitchen torch or place under the broiler for 2 to 3 minutes.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, arrange 2 marrowbone halves and a spoonful of beet cylinders on a plate. Drizzle them both with the vinegar puree.</div>
<div class="note" id="c08-note34">
<p class="note_head"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>NOTES</strong></span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">1. Soaking the bones in ice water for at least 2 hours before using will remove any excess blood and impurities.</span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">2. Save the beet scraps created when preparing different elements in this recipe for the beet juice required for the vinegar. They will not yield enough juice for the whole recipe, but it is nevertheless a good way to avoid waste.</span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">3. The yellow and red beets can be cooked in the same water as long as the yellow beets are cooked first.</span></p>

<p class="Essays_header"><a id="page191"/><span class="dk_blue">HOW TO ASSEMBLE A <a id="ind581a"/>HOMEMADE SMOKER</span></p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">Constructing a smoker is not as difficult as it sounds. The only tools required for a basic smoker are a bottom compartment that can handle direct heat and has a tight-fitting lid (or aluminum foil), the smoking material, a kitchen torch or matchstick to light the smoking material, and a top compartment to hold what is being smoked. A deep hotel pan (or deep baking pan), a perforated hotel pan (or a wire rack), and aluminum foil work well. A vegetable steamer—a pan with a rack insert and a lid—is also a good option.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">Put a bed of hay, leaves, wood chips, or onion peels in the bottom compartment and arrange what you are smoking in the top compartment and place over high heat. Ignite the smoking material and get a good flame going by gently blowing on it. Then set the top compartment in the bottom compartment and seal the entire set-up securely with the lid (foil). The lid will cut off the oxygen supply, resulting in a smoldering fire that will infuse the food with smokiness. The smoke will take about 5 to 10 minutes to subside, depending upon the intensity of the flame and the smoking material used. At this point, repeat the process once or twice more, depending on the smokiness desired.</p>

<div class="yield">SERVES 4 <span class="yield_pipe">|</span> PREPARATION TIME: ABOUT 2¼ HOURS</div>
<div class="headnote1">This lovely little appetizer, with its bubbling cheese and mushrooms prepared two ways, is easy to create. Collecting mushrooms appeals to Gunnar’s love of <a id="ind388a"/>foraging, and one of the prime spots to look for them is in eastern Iceland, where they flourish in the birch forests. Elsewhere in the country they are less commonly encountered because of past deforestation.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent">Gunnar likes to use larch mushrooms, one of the most common species in Iceland, for this dish. They can be difficult to find elsewhere, so just use your favorite mix of fresh mushrooms in their place. For the cheese, he uses the funky smelling Ísbúi, but that, too, is a challenge to find outside of Iceland. Aged Gouda or raclette make a fine substitute.</div>
<div class="ingredient">

<p class="IL_item"><strong>4 large, thick slices Ísbúi, aged Gouda, or raclette cheese</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">To make the mushroom and birch foam, combine the mushrooms, water, and birch in a saucepan and bring to a vigorous simmer. Turn down the heat to low, cover partially, and simmer gently for 1½ hours. Keep an eye on the water during this step and add more as needed to prevent scorching. Drain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve, reserving the liquid and solids separately. Return the liquid to the saucepan, bring to a boil, and reduce by half. Add the milk and reduce by one-fourth, stirring frequently to prevent the milk from foaming over the sides of the pan. Strain once more through a fine-mesh sieve, as the milk can produce a film on the surface of the liquid. Season with salt and vinegar. When ready to serve, add the soy lecithin and process with an immersion blender until foamy (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c08_r1.htm#c08-note35">see note</a>).</div>
<div class="method">To make the mushroom puree, discard the birch twigs from the reserved mushrooms. Put the mushrooms in a blender or food processor and process to a chunky paste. Combine the cream and butter in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and stir until most of the liquid has evaporated and the mushrooms have thickened. Season with salt and vinegar.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, spoon the mushroom puree onto a plate and place a slice of cheese on top to cover the puree completely. Ignite the cheese with a kitchen torch until it is golden brown and bubbly, then top with a generous spoonful of the foam.</div>

<div class="headnote1">Salsify, a root vegetable with white, creamy flesh and sturdy skin, is also known as the oyster plant because its flavor recalls the brininess of that shellfish. A member of the dandelion family, salsify can be used in the same way as other root vegetables, such as parsnip, celery root, and rutabaga, and is a favorite of Gunnar’s, who prizes its long shelf life and pronounced flavor.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent">Here, it is paired with redfish, pine, birch tree schnapps, and burned butter for an interesting flavor marriage that melds the virtues of the woods and the sea. Gunnar likes redfish for its lean flavor and flaky texture, but should you have trouble finding it, flounder, trout, smelt, or tilapia are good substitutes. This dish represents eastern Iceland especially well because the region is one of the few in the country where the forest meets the sea.</div>

<div class="headnote">Eastern Iceland is filled with welcoming country hotels that serve buffets of traditional dishes. This recipe is the refined version of some of those buffets; it calls for slow cooking spice-studded pork belly, glazing it with a cap of herbaceous whey, and accompanying it with crispy pork skin, caramelized parsnips, and celery root puree. The dish is finished with an elegant herb emulsion and <a id="ind386a"/>mountain spinach, an amethyst-colored herb also known as orach. Mountain spinach, which has long flourished in the temperate climates of central Europe, has recently found its way to the greenhouses of Iceland, where it has quickly become a favorite of Gunnar’s, who values it for both its pronounced flavor and its jewel-box color.</div>

<div class="method"><a id="page199"/>To make the pork belly, cut the skin off (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c08_r1.htm#c08-note36">see note</a>) and save it to make the crispy pork skin. Combine the water, salt, sugar, cinnamon, juniper, cloves, and rosemary in a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Place the pork belly in a vacuum bag, pour the brine over it, and seal on the lowest setting. Refrigerate for 12 hours.</div>
<div class="method">Preheat an immersion circulator to 167°F (75°C). Place the bag in the circulator and cook for 12 hours. Remove the bag from the circulator and keep warm.</div>
<div class="method">To make the <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-s51">crispy pork skin</a>, prepare as directed, crisping in the oil and seasoning with the salt, cinnamon, cloves, and juniper.</div>
<div class="method">To make the glaze, reduce the whey in a small saucepan over medium heat until only 1 tablespoon remains. Set aside. In a separate small saucepan, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter with half the oil over medium-high heat. Add the shallot, cinnamon, rosemary, and cloves and cook, stirring, for 5 to 7 minutes, until the shallot is caramelized and the spices are aromatic. And the vinegar and reduce by three-fourths. Add the stock and reduce by half. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and stir until melted. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into the saucepan holding the whey and whisk together. Season with salt and vinegar.</div>
<div class="method">To finish the pork belly, remove the belly from the bag and cut into 8 equal pieces. Heat a large sauté pan over medium heat. When the pan is hot, arrange the belly, fat side down, in the pan. Let the fat render until it begins to turn a light golden brown. Spoon some of the glaze into the pan and then, using tongs, turn the belly pieces over to coat them in the glaze. Cook for a minute or two more before adding more glaze and turning once more. Continue this process until the pork belly is lacquered, glossy, and well coated in glaze.</div>
<div class="method">To make the caramelized parsnip, bring a saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add the parsnip and cook for about 5 minutes, until almost tender. The timing will depend on the size of the parsnip. Drain and pat dry with paper towels. Melt enough butter with some oil in a sauté pan over medium-high heat to form a thin film on the pan bottom. Add the parsnip and sauté until deeply caramelized. Remove from the heat, and when cool enough to handle, slice thinly crosswise on a mandoline (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03-note13">see notes</a>).</div>
<div class="method"><a id="page200"/>To make the parsnip puree, melt the butter in a <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c02_r1.htm#c02-eass2">pressure cooker</a>. Add the parsnips, baking soda, and salt, lock the lid in place, bring to medium-high pressure, and cook for 15 minutes, until the parsnips are caramelized and tender. Let the pressure release naturally for 15 minutes. Remove the lid, transfer the contents of the cooker to a blender, and process until smooth. Season with salt and add a generous amount of beer vinegar. The parsnips are very sweet and require a substantial splash of vinegar for balance. If the mixture is too thick after seasoning, add water to thin it to the desired consistency.</div>
<div class="method">To make the celery root puree, preheat the immersion circulator to 183°F (84°C). Place the celery root, milk, and cream in a vacuum bag and seal on the lowest setting. Cook in the circulator for about 8 minutes, until tender. Test for doneness by pinching the celery root through the bag. If it is tender and breaks apart easily, it is ready. The timing will depend on how fine the cut is. Remove the bag from the circulator and drain the celery root, reserving the solids and cooking liquid separately. Transfer the celery root to a blender, add the butter, and process on high speed to a puree, adding a little of the cooking liquid if necessary to achieve a smooth consistency. Season with salt and cider vinegar.</div>
<div class="method">To make the herb emulsion, in a blender, combine the mustard, beer vinegar, garlic, shallot, dill, parsley, and water and process on high speed to a puree while adding the oil in a slow, steady stream. Add more water, if necessary, to achieve a smooth consistency. Season with salt and more vinegar, if desired.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, arrange 2 pork belly slices fat side-up on each plate. Spoon the parsnip and celery root purees alongside. Arrange a few pieces of the caramelized parsnips next to the purees and drizzle everything with the herb emulsion. Garnish with mountain spinach.</div>

<div class="headnote1">Wild geese, which soar overhead everywhere in Iceland, are a prized protein on the Icelandic table. Wild birds are coveted foods in the country, with the greatest reverence reserved for a breed of grouse called a ptarmigan, a bird primarily found in the eastern region whose feathers change from brown to white in winter as a form of camouflage. This makes it an extremely elusive target and accounts for the celebratory meal it prompts when a skilled hunter brings one home.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent">Smoked ptarmigan is a traditional part of many Christmas feasts in Iceland, but goose is frequently a stand-in when the grouse is not available. If goose is difficult to find where you live, substitute duck breasts and double the quantity. Gunnar serves goose at Dill in the fall and winter months. It is paired here with celery root and <a id="ind419a"/><a id="ind433a"/>parsley and dill oil, making it a perfect dish to serve during the colder months of the year.</div>

<div class="method"><a id="page203"/>To make the herb oil, combine the parsley, dill, and oil in a blender and process on high speed for 7 to 10 minutes, until steaming hot and the herbs are fully incorporated into the oil. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for 12 hours. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve, then transfer to a squeeze bottle. The oil will keep in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</div>
<div class="method">To make the celery root puree, preheat an immersion circulator to 183°F (84°C). Place the celery root, milk, cream, and salt in a vacuum bag and seal on the lowest setting. Cook in the circulator for about 8 minutes, until tender. The timing will depend on how fine the cut. Test the doneness of the celery root by pinching it through the bag.

<div class="method">To make the fried celery root, melt the butter with the oil in a sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the celery root and fry, turning every few minutes to ensure even cooking, for 8 to 10 minutes, until golden brown on the outside and creamy on the inside. Add the vinegar and cook until completely evaporated. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the celery root to paper towels to drain. Add the shallots to the same pan and sauté for about 7 minutes, until tender. Add the burned butter and chives and toss together with the celery root. Season with salt. Keep warm.</div>

Add the sugar and cook, stirring occasionally, until caramelized. Add the cider vinegar and cook until reduced by three-fourths. Add both stocks, cover, and simmer for about 30 minutes, until the sauce is glossy and coats the back of a wooden spoon. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve and season with salt and beer vinegar.</div>
<div class="method">To make the fried goose breast, melt the butter with the oil in a large sauté pan over high heat. Add the thyme and sauté for 30 seconds.

Turn down the heat to medium-high and continue to cook for about 6 more minutes, until medium-rare, or to desired doneness. Transfer the breasts to paper towels and let rest for 7 minutes, flipping them once at the halfway point to distribute the internal juices evenly before serving. Thinly slice, dividing each breast into 2 servings.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, spoon the celery root puree on a plate, top with goose breast slices, and arrange the fried celery root alongside. Drizzle everything with the sauce and the herb oil.</div>

<div class="headnote"><em>Ástarpungar</em> translates as “love balls” in Icelandic, and once you see their shape, you will realize it means exactly what you think it does. They are basically fried doughnut holes, and in some households in northern Iceland, they are still prepared weekly and typically served with rhubarb or crowberry jam. At Dill, Gunnar serves them with raisins that have been plumped in his birch schnapps and sprinkles them with <a id="ind71a"/><a id="ind610a"/>birch sugar. Should you not have a bottle of birch schnapps on hand, dark rum is a good substitute. The one essential is a dollop of freshly whipped cream, and voilà, your love balls are ready to be served to the people in your life toward whom you feel the most affection. Gunnar’s recipe is from an old Icelandic recipe book that belonged to his grandmother.</div>

<p class="IL_item"><strong>Scant 1½ cups (200 g) black or golden raisins</strong></p>

<p class="IL_item"><strong>1 cup (200 g) sugar</strong></p>
<p class="IL_head"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>CREAM</strong></span></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>½ cup (120 ml) heavy cream</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>¼ cup (50 g) crème fraîche</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1½ tablespoons sugar</strong></p>
<p class="IL_head"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>LOVE BALLS</strong></span></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>4 cups (500 g) all-purpose flour</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1½ tablespoons sugar</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1 teaspoon salt</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>2 tablespoons baking powder</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>2 cups (480 ml) buttermilk</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>2 eggs</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Birch-soaked raisins (at left)</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Rapeseed oil, for deep-frying</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">To make the birch-soaked raisins, combine the schnapps and sugar in a saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat and add the raisins. Let stand at room temperature for at least 1 hour.</div>
<div class="method">To make the birch sugar, pulse the birch leaves in a spice grinder to a powder, then sift through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any large bits and stems. Transfer the ground leaves to a spice grinder, add the sugar, and pulse until a fine powder forms.</div>
<div class="method">To make the cream, in a bowl, whip the cream to stiff peaks. Fold in the crème fraîche and sugar just until fully incorporated. Cover and refrigerate until chilled.</div>
<div class="method"><a id="page207"/>To make the love balls, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder in a bowl and stir to mix well. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture, add the buttermilk to the well, and then pull the flour into the well, mixing it with the liquid. Whisk until fully incorporated. The consistency should be thick but pourable. Do not worry about lumps; they make the balls better in the end. Whisk in the eggs one at a time, incorporating the first egg completely before adding the second. Finally, stir in half the birch-soaked raisins (reserve the other half for service), mixing well.</div>
<div class="method">Pour oil to a depth of 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10 cm) into a deep, heavy pot and heat to 350°F (180°C). Line a large plate with paper towels. When the oil is hot, for each love ball, scoop up 2 to 3 tablespoons of the dough with an ice cream scoop or large spoon and carefully drop the ball into the oil. Do not make the balls any larger or they will be golden brown on the exterior but still raw in the center. Also, do not crowd them in the oil or they will not cook evenly and they will absorb the oil. Deep-fry the balls, turning them once, for about 3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Using a slotted spoon, transfer them to the paper towel–lined plate to drain. Repeat with the remaining batter.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, sprinkle the warm balls with the birch sugar and drizzle them with the cream. Serve the reserved raisins on the side.</div>
