<h1 class="chapter">gluten-free fresh pasta</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>This recipe was first printed in our <i>Sicily</i> book as in recent years we have discovered that Giancarlo and our son Giorgio cannot tolerate wheat in their diets. This recipe was a saving grace for us. It can be used for cut ribbons as well as stuffed and shaped pasta.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 6 AS A STARTER / 4 AS A MAIN</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>50 g (2 oz/generous ¼ cup) gluten-free plain (all-purpose) flour</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>50 g (2 oz/generous ⅓ cup) buckwheat flour</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>175 g (6 oz/scant 1½ cups) tapioca flour (tapioca starch)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 heaped tablespoon xantham gum</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>180 g (6¼ oz) egg (approx. 3 large eggs)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2–3 tablespoons cold water</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Put all the ingredients, including 2 tablespoons of the cold water, into a food processor and blend until a ball of dough forms. If it is very dry and doesn’t form a ball, add another tablespoon of water. You are aiming for a firm but pliable dough. Knead the dough for a few minutes to ensure it is well blended. Wrap in cling film (plastic wrap) and rest for 30 minutes at room temperature, or if you prefer to keep it longer it can be left up to 1 day in the fridge.</p>
<p class="tx">If you don’t have a food processor, tip the dry ingredients into a bowl and stir to combine. Make a well in the centre of the ingredients and add the eggs with the oil and 2 tablespoons of water. Use a table knife to break up the eggs and combine the dry ingredients little by little. Eventually your knife will become ineffective, so use your hands to bring the dough together into a ball. If it is very dry and hard add 1 tablespoon more water. Knead and rest the dough as above.</p>
<p class="tx">After the dough has rested, use as fresh pasta, rolling the dough by hand or through a machine, remembering to use gluten-free flour for dusting.</p>
