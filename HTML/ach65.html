<h3 class="h3b"><a id="page_129"/><a id="ach65"/>tomato sauce with mushrooms</h3>
<p class="author1"><span class="txit">marinara con funghi</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This is the first sauce I learned to make. It is simple and inexpensive. During the lean years when I was just starting out in New York, I found it a great comfort nutritionally and economically. This recipe makes enough sauce for 1 pound of linguine or spaghetti. It may be made one day ahead; refrigerate it and reheat before serving. This sauce also pairs well with <a class="nounder" href="ach90.html#page_175">Polenta</a>: Cook the polenta and then stir in one third of the sauce. Distribute among four dinner plates and top with remaining sauce.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 tablespoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 clove garlic, sliced</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">10 ounces white mushrooms, cut into <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub>-inch-thick slices</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 cups canned whole plum tomatoes (about one 35-ounce can)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 fresh basil leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano leaves or <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> teaspoon dried (optional)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Freshly grated Parmesan or pecorino Romano cheese for garnish (optional)</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Warm the olive oil in a large sauté pan set over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook until softened and lightly colored, about 2 minutes. Stir in the mushrooms and cook until lightly colored and softened, about 5 minutes. Remove the mushrooms to a plate and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Add the tomatoes to the sauté pan, crushing them with your hands or the back of a slotted spoon as you stir them into the pan. Add the basil and oregano (if using), and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the sauce thickens slightly, about 15 minutes. Return the mushrooms to the pan and continue to simmer until the sauce is sweet, about another 15 minutes. Serve over pasta garnished with Parmesan or pecorino Romano cheese if desired.</p>
