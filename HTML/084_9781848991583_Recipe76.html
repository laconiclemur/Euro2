<p class="acktxt">4 large Savoy cabbage leaves, for wrapping</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 salmon fillets, about 4 ounces each</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">12 pearl onions, peeled</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 teaspoon sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 ounces thick pancetta, cut into ¼-inch lardons</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">3½ cups fresh podded peas</p>
<p class="acktxta">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE LEMON BUTTER SAUCE</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">4 tablespoons whipping cream</p>
<p class="acktxt">7 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</p>
<p class="acktxt">finely grated zest and juice of 1 lemon</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add the cabbage leaves, then turn the heat down to medium and cook 5 minutes, or until tender. Using a large slotted spoon, lift out the leaves and transfer them to a bowl of ice water and leave 1 minute; remove and pat dry. Cut along each side of the central stem, about three-quarters of the way up a leaf from the stem end. Discard the stem, leaving the leaf still attached at the top; repeat with the remaining leaves. Season the leaves with a little salt and pepper, then put the leaves, stem-end facing up, on the countertop. Lay a salmon fillet horizontally on the bottom half of a leaf, fold in the sides and wrap up to make a package; repeat to make 4 packages. Wrap each package tightly in plastic wrap. Twist and secure each end with a knot, pushing out any air. Leave in the refrigerator until ready to cook.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. When it is foaming, add the pearl onions and cook 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, without browning. Season with salt and pepper, add enough water to cover and simmer 15 minutes, uncovered, or until the onions are soft and the liquid reduces by half. Add the sugar and cook, stirring, 3 to 4 minutes longer until the onions become glazed and transparent, then leave to one side.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Meanwhile, bring a small pan of water to a boil. Add the pancetta and blanch 1 to 2 minutes until just cooked. Drain, then refresh in cold water, tip onto paper towels and pat dry. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the pancetta and sauté 7 to 8 minutes until crisp and golden brown. Leave to one side.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Bring a large saucepan of water to a simmer, with a steamer insert on top. Put the salmon packages in the steamer, cover and steam 9 minutes, or until they are cooked but still slightly pink in the middle, then leave to rest in a warm place 2 minutes.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> Meanwhile, make the lemon butter. Pour the cream into the cleaned small pan and bring to a boil. Remove the pan from the heat and add 1 tablespoon cold water, then whisk in the butter, a little at a time. If becomes too thick, add a little lemon juice to thin it. Continue until all the butter is incorporated. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then add the lemon zest, cover with plastic wrap and leave to one side.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>6</b> Add the peas to the pan with the onions and simmer 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until tender. Add the pancetta and season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove and discard the plastic wrap from the salmon and serve with the pea mixture and the lemon butter sauce spooned over the top or served separately.</p>
