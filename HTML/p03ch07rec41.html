<p class="summary"><span class="bi">I went shopping with Rosa at Madrid’s San Martín market and then watched her</span> cook lunch for friends in her charming attic flat. Rosa was born in Salamanca. Her mother was from a Basque shipowning family. Her father, a university professor, was a gourmand who had acquired a varied palate, because his notary father moved the family between northern Castile, Cantabria, Castellón, Alicante, and Madrid. He always had little stories to tell about the dishes that his wife put on the table, and he passed his fascination with the history of food to his daughter.</p>
<p class="summary">In 1985, Rosa founded a company that made pastries and frozen sauces. Now she teaches in cooking schools in Madrid, Guadalajara, and Salamanca. She teaches all kinds of people, including chefs, pastry cooks, and butchers. Young people in Spain want to learn about new technology, the latest international trends, and healthy eating and organic foods, as well as how to prepare quick and easy dishes, and more traditional ones to make on weekends. Rosa’s cooking shows how traditional foods can be updated and become lighter, healthier, and more pleasing without losing their character. She has written several books, including <span class="italic">Arroces</span> (<span class="italic">Rice</span>) and <span class="italic">3,000 Años de Cocina Española</span> (<span class="italic">Three Thousand Years of Spanish Cooking</span>), with Monique Fuller. Some of the recipes she has e-mailed me have gone into this book, including two recipes for <span class="italic">berenjenas rellenas,</span> stuffed eggplants.</p>
