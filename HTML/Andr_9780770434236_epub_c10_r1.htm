<div class="chapter_opener_text" id="div19">When I was a young boy, I used to help my father, Mariano, cook the best-known dish in Spanish cuisine: paella. We had this huge paella pan, almost a meter in diameter, that could feed more than a hundred people. Because we didn’t have a big home, my father loved to invite dozens of friends to the countryside in the spring and summer for a spectacular paella. He would put me in charge of the open fire. I would add more wood when my father needed it at the beginning of the paella process, just after adding the rice. Then, when the heat reached its peak, I would help move the charcoal away from under the paella pan to ensure that the rice wouldn’t overcook. Without knowing any better, I thought that my father had relegated me to the most menial, sweaty, and simple job around the paella pan. It was only many years later that I realized that he had actually given me the single most important task in creating paella.</div>
<div class="chapter_opener_text1" id="div20">Just like the classic American barbecue, it’s all about the fire. Paella began life as a country meal, using the ingredients of the surrounding fields and the heat from burning vines. Like the barbecue, paella cooking has traditionally been the preserve of the menfolk, cooking for large groups of friends in the open air. And even though we don’t use firewood in today’s kitchens, controlling the heat is still the most important task of anyone aspiring to cook classic paella. The paella is not strictly the food itself, but the large, flat round pan we use to cook the rice (just as the barbecue isn’t the meat, but the grill it sits on). This two-handled pan is the perfect medium for the heat; as the liquid reduces, the oil and proteins inside the paella mixture seal in the heat, cooking the rice underneath. That’s why it’s so important to resist the temptation to dip your finger or a spoon into the rice while it’s cooking. If you break the film on the surface, the heat will escape as if from a chimney and the rice will cook unevenly. Paella pans range from small (for two people) to huge (for five hundred people). For the recipes here, a twelve-inch paella pan is ideal; you can find one at one of the websites listed in the Sources section. (You can also use a large sauté pan.)</div>
<div class="chapter_opener_text1" id="div21"><a id="page153"/>Of course, rice is the key ingredient in any paella, and it’s good to get to know the different varieties we have in Spain. When we talk about rice, we are mainly talking about short-grain rice like Bomba from Valencia, which looks like a little ball, or Calasparra from Murcia, which is a little longer in shape. These are becoming increasingly available across the United States. But if you can’t find either, you can substitute Arborio. (Never use a long-grain or parboiled rice.) That’s true of the other rice dishes in this chapter as well. Just remember that different varieties of rice cook in slightly different ways. If you use a rice that isn’t Spanish, you’ll need to check on the side of the box for the right quantity of stock or water to use.</div>
<div class="chapter_opener_text1" id="div22">People often expect rice to be a side dish to other ingredients: chicken, seafood, fresh vegetables. Yet the real star of these recipes is the rice and nothing but the rice.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div24">I can remember as a child listening to the older generation talking about the days when chicken was served only on special occasions in the little towns across Spain. People had few chickens and little grain to feed them, so they’d wait for a birthday or a festival to kill the birds and make a spectacular stew. This is an homage to those days, when chickens were something special and the dishes that featured them were the centerpiece of a feast.</div>
<div class="yield" id="div25"><span class="bold"><span class="brown1">Serves 4</span></span></div>
<div class="ingredients" id="div26">
<div class="IL_item_top" id="div27">2 tablespoons Spanish extra-virgin olive oil</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div28">2 chicken legs, cut into small pieces</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div29">½ pound fresh mushrooms, such as chanterelles</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div30">3 ounces green beans, cut into 1-inch pieces</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div31">½ garlic clove, peeled and finely chopped (about 1 teaspoon)</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div32">2 tablespoons chopped <span class="italic">jamón serrano</span> (Spanish cured ham)</div>

<div class="IL_item" id="div37">1 bay leaf</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div38">1 tablespoon salt</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div39">1½ cups Spanish Bomba or Calasparra rice, or Arborio rice</div>
</div>
<div class="method" id="div40">Heat the olive oil in a paella pan over high heat. Add the chicken and sauté until it is very brown on all sides, about 8 minutes. Remove and set aside.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div41">Add the mushrooms to the paella pan and sauté until they are golden, about 3 minutes. Add the green beans and the garlic, and cook for 3 minutes. Return the chicken to the pan, along with the ham.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div42">Pour in the white wine and cook until it is reduced by half, about 1 minute. Add the <span class="italic">sofrito</span> and cook for 3 minutes. Pour in the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Crush the saffron and add it to the pan, along with the bay leaf. Season with the salt. (Make sure it’s just a little salty, because when you add the rice, the dish will balance itself out.)</div>
<div class="method1" id="div43">Add the rice, taking care to spread it evenly around the pan. Cook for 5 minutes on a high flame, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon. You’ll see the rice floating around the pan. If it’s not, add an extra ½ cup of stock or water.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div44">Reduce the heat to low and cook at a slow boil for 10 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed. Never put your finger or a spoon into the paella during this cooking, or the rice will cook unevenly.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div45">Remove the pan from the heat and let it sit for 3 minutes. The stock should be absorbed by the rice and there should be a nice shine to the top of the paella. Serve immediately.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div49"><span class="italic">Arroz con leche</span> is the dessert that best reflects Asturian cooking. Mieres is my hometown, and I return there as often as I can to visit my family. Asturias doesn’t produce rice, but it’s undoubtedly one of the best milk-producing regions in Europe, with its green pastures and mountains. In Washington, I buy a local organic milk from Blue Highland Dairy that reminds me a lot of Asturian milk—full of cream and flavor—for this wonderfully creamy dish.</div>
<div class="yield" id="div50"><span class="bold"><span class="brown1">Serves 4</span></span></div>
<div class="ingredients" id="div51">
<div class="IL_item_top" id="div52">10 cups whole milk</div>

<div class="method1" id="div60">Add the butter and simmer for another 5 minutes. Add the sugar and mix vigorously. Remove the pot from the heat and spread the rice on a platter. Leave it to rest. As it cools, the milk will develop a thin skin on the top of the rice; fold this into the rice before serving. The pudding will be ready when it reaches room temperature, in 3 or 4 hours. You can also serve it cold from the refrigerator the next day.</div>

<div class="tip_header" id="div61">José’s tips</div>
<div class="tip_text" id="div62">If you want a richer rice, add 3 egg yolks after removing the pot from the heat. You can also sprinkle some sugar on top and caramelize it with a torch. When you take the rice off the heat, the mixture should not be too compact, because it will become even denser as it cools down. You can always add some extra hot milk later if it becomes too dense.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div64"><span class="italic">Bogavante</span>, or clawed lobster, should not be confused with the clawless spiny lobster called <span class="italic">langosta</span>, which has a more delicate and subtle flavor. In Spain both are considered a delicacy and are available only at a very high price, mainly because they are wild and hard to catch. When I first came to New York and visited the Fulton Fish Market, in downtown Manhattan, I couldn’t believe my eyes: the <span class="italic">bogavante</span> lobsters cost less than $4 a pound! This paella is the perfect showcase for the lobster, proving that the best paellas are those with just one or two main ingredients.</div>
<div class="yield" id="div65"><span class="bold"><span class="brown1">Serves 4</span></span></div>
<div class="ingredients" id="div66">
<div class="IL_item_top" id="div67">1 small Maine lobster (1 to 1¼ pounds)</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div68">2 tablespoons Spanish extra-virgin olive oil</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div69">6 ounces fresh squid, cut into small pieces</div>

</div>
<div class="method" id="div76">Using a very sharp knife, separate the lobster head from the tail. Cut the lobster head in half, putting the blade between the eyes. Slice through the head cleanly, then cut it into quarters, and cut the claws in half. Cut the tail into 6 medallions.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div77">In a paella pan over high heat, sear the lobster medallions in the olive oil for 1 minute. Remove them from the pan and set them aside. Add the squid to the pan and sear for 15 seconds. Add the <span class="italic">sofrito</span>, stir, and cook for 1 minute. Add the garlic, reduce the heat to low, and cook for 3 minutes.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div78">Pour in the fish stock, raise the heat, and bring to a boil. Crush the saffron and add it to the pan. Season with the salt. (Make sure it’s just a little bit salty; the rice will balance out the saltiness.)</div>
<div class="method1" id="div79">Add the rice, taking care not to dump it in a pile—spread it evenly around the pan. Cook for 5 minutes over high heat, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon. You’ll see the rice floating around the pan at this stage. If it’s not, the mixture is too dry and you should add another ½ cup of stock or water.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div80">Place the lobster head, claws, and medallions on top and reduce the heat to low. After this point, never put your finger or anything else in the rice. If you do, you will break the natural film that forms on top of the paella and the rice will cook unevenly. Maintaining a slow boil, cook for 10 minutes, or until all the liquid is absorbed.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div85">If there’s something Americans and Spaniards share, it’s a passion for clams—and for eating them raw. (What we don’t do so often in Spain is to fry them, which my friend Bob Kinkead does with Ipswich clams at his restaurant in Washington, D.C.) This simple rice dish maintains the best of the unique, fresh clam flavor. It’s not raw, and it’s certainly not fried—it’s a delicious something in between.</div>

<div class="method1" id="div101">Add the carrots to the sauté pan and cook for another 5 minutes. Add the rice and cook for 2 minutes. Add the wine and cook until reduced by half, about 30 seconds. Pour in 1½ cups of the hot fish stock and a little salt to taste. (Take care with the salt because the clams add their own saltiness to the rice.) Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the rice is silky and creamy, 14 minutes.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div102">In a separate small pan, bring the remaining ½ cup of fish stock to a boil. Once it begins to boil, add the clams and the asparagus. Cover, and cook until all the clams are open; depending on their size, this will take 1 to 2 minutes.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div103">Add the clam mixture, the parsley, and the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to the rice and stir well. Bring to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, remove from the heat and serve immediately.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div107">Spanish fishermen have a technique for catching squid with a hook so the squid cannot use its defense mechanism of squirting ink to protect itself. The squid caught this way—<span class="italic">calamares de potera</span>—have their ink sacs intact and are highly prized; they cost three or four times more than squid caught in a normal net. Black rice with squid, or even more traditionally with cuttlefish, is a dish I love to cook at home. Of all the rice dishes we have in Spain, this is one of the most distinctive.</div>
<div class="headnote1" id="div108">You can serve this with <a class="hlink" href="Andr_9780770434236_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-s01">Allioli</a> on the side or mixed in with the rice.</div>

<div class="ingredients" id="div110">
<div class="IL_item_top" id="div111">3 squid (about 6 ounces total), cleaned</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div112">Salt to taste</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div113">1 quart <a class="hlink" href="Andr_9780770434236_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-s03">Traditional Fish Stock</a></div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div114">2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div115">2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div116">4 tablespoons Spanish extra-virgin olive oil</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div117">2 tablespoons <a class="hlink" href="Andr_9780770434236_epub_c02_r1.htm#c02-s03">Sofrito</a></div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div118">1 cup Spanish Bomba or Calasparra rice, or Arborio rice</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div119">4 teaspoons squid ink (see <a class="hlink" href="Andr_9780770434236_epub_c10_r1.htm#c10-tip5">tips</a>)</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div120">8 medium shrimp, shelled and deveined</div>
</div>
<div class="method" id="div121">Slice the squid along the sides to open them up. Cut the heads into small pieces, and cut the bodies into small triangles. Sprinkle with a little salt.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div122">Bring the fish stock to a boil in a medium saucepan. Once it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and maintain a simmer. Make sure the stock is a little salty for your taste, because when you add the rice, the seasoning will balance out.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div123">Combine the garlic, parsley leaves, and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a cup. Blend to create a smooth paste (or smash them together with a mortar and pestle).</div>
<div class="method1" id="div124">Pour the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil into a terra-cotta (or metal) casserole over a medium flame. Place the squid in the oil and sauté, stirring with a spoon, until slightly brown, 1 minute. Stir in the <span class="italic">sofrito</span> and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the rice and cook, stirring frequently, for 1 minute. Add the squid ink, and stir in the hot fish stock. Stir in the garlic mixture and maintain at a medium simmer for 5 minutes.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div125">Add the shrimp and simmer for another 10 minutes. Serve hot.</div>

<div class="tip_header" id="div126">José’s tips</div>
<div class="tip_text" id="div127">If you can find cuttlefish, use it instead of the squid. Cuttlefish has a very distinctive flavor, and traditionally black rice is made with it.</div>
<div class="tip_text1" id="div128">If the squid or cuttlefish are fresh, look for a tiny black bag inside the body. Smash this sac with a fork and mix the ink with the stock. This is the natural ink, and it will make your rice taste like the sea.</div>
