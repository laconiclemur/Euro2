  <p class="center-para"><a id="page_71"/>Stews are popular all over the world; they are warming, welcoming, and a wonderful way to use economical cuts of meat. Pieces of meat that are slowly cooked in a sauce with herbs, spices and seasonings are often far more tender and tasty than a quickly grilled steak, and with the inclusion of vegetables can be a meal in themselves – or serve with polenta (cornmeal), rice, mashed potatoes or lots of good bread to mop up the juices.</p>

  <p class="center-para">The classic Italian way of preparing a stew begins with a <em>soffritto</em>, a gently fried mix of onion, celery and carrot – this important step forms the base of the stew, ensuring maximum flavour. The sealing or browning of the pieces of meat is equally important, giving a rich flavour and adding colour to the stew. It is important to cook the stew on a very gentle heat because boiling will toughen the meat. To enhance the flavour, stews are best made the day before and gently reheated when required.</p>

  <p class="center-para">You can usually find ready-cut chunks of meat clearly marked ‘for stewing’ in supermarkets, or your butcher will cut the meat for you. If you are beginning with a larger piece of meat, it should be cut into cubes of roughly 4–5cm/1½– 2 inches; pieces that are too small will fall apart and may dry out during cooking.</p>

  <p class="center-para">The following are ideal cuts for stewing: Lamb: scrag end and middle neck, shoulder, knuckle/shank Beef: neck, chuck, blade, brisket, thick flank, thin flank, skirt, shin/shank, topside, silverside, knuckle Pork: shoulder – although you can use any cut, shoulder is the most economical</p>

  <p class="center-para">Italian stews are as varied as the country: from a rich Tyrolean goulash originating in the Austrian-influenced Alpine region of Trentino-Alto Adige, to my slow-cooked vegetable stew using the typical sun-drenched ingredients of the southern regions – you will find a dish to satisfy every taste and mood.</p>

  <h3 class="h3a">Tyrolean beef stew</h3>

  <p class="image"><a id="page_73"/><img alt="Illustration" src="../Images/f0073-01.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="chap-para">This classic stew from the Trentino-Alto Adige or South Tyrol region of northern Italy is slow cooked with onions, cumin and paprika – its distinct central European flavour is influenced by neighbouring Austria. The gradual addition of stock gives this stew a gentle flavour; pancetta is added, so be careful not to make your stock too salty. This dish is traditionally served with runny polenta (cornmeal). It is also delicious with a piece of good country bread whose soft part is removed, cubed and toasted; the goulash is served in the bread crust and the toasted bits sprinkled on top – a dish fit for an Austrian king!</p>

  <p class="ing1">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing">3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing">2 large onions, sliced</p>

  <p class="ing">100g/3½oz pancetta, cubed</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tsp paprika</p>

  <p class="ing">2 sprigs of thyme</p>

  <p class="ing2">polenta (cornmeal) or toasted country bread, to serve</p>

  <p class="step">Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan and sweat the onions on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring all the time to prevent sticking, until softened. Remove and set aside.</p>

  <p class="step">Add the pancetta to the pan and cook on a medium heat until coloured but not burnt. Remove from the pan and set aside. Return the onions to the pan, add about 3 tablespoons of stock and cook for a minute or so until the liquid has evaporated.</p>

  <p class="step">Add the beef, increase the heat and brown the meat all over. Add 100ml/3½fl oz/scant ½ cup of stock, reduce the heat to low, cover with a lid and cook very gently for 30 minutes, then add another 100ml/3½fl oz/scant ½ cup of stock and continue to cook for 30 minutes.</p>

  <p class="step">Stir in the garlic, cumin, paprika, thyme and pancetta. Add 400ml/14fl oz/1⅔ cups of stock, cover with a lid and cook over a low heat for a further 1 hour, gradually adding more stock and stirring from time to time to ensure the meat doesn’t stick.</p>

  <p class="step">Remove from the heat and serve with toasted country bread or runny polenta.</p>

  <h3 class="h3a">Slow-cooked marinated beef with chocolate</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">Although adding chocolate to savoury dishes is a South American tradition, it has become increasingly popular in Italian dishes – cocoa powder is even added to pasta dough! I must say I am not too keen on these gimmicky recipes; however, the addition of a little good-quality dark chocolate to slow-cooked beef does enrich the sauce.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Serves 4</p>

  <h3 class="h3a">Everyday beef and vegetable stew</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">This is the family stew my wife Liz normally makes at home – nothing fancy or complicated, just good old-fashioned comfort food. It is delicious, nutritious and good value for money, using economical pieces of stewing beef and root vegetables.

  <h3 class="h3a">Braised veal shins</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">There are two ways of making this classic Milanese dish – with or without tomatoes. The latter, known in Italian as <em>in bianco</em>, is actually the original version: the veal is slowly braised with vegetables, white wine and stock and garnished with gremolada for extra flavour and colour. Veal shin or knuckle is a cheap, tough cut but extremely flavoursome and ideal for slow cooking. The name <em>ossobuco</em> in Italian means ‘bone with a hole’, a reference to the hollow marrow bone at the centre of the cross-cut veal shin. Ask your butcher for veal shin for ossobuco and he will cut the pieces for you for this excellent dish. In Milan, this is traditionally served with risotto alla Milanese – saffron risotto.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing">4 cross-cut slices of veal shin, about 300g/10½oz each</p>

  <p class="ing">plain (all-purpose) flour, to dust</p>

  <p class="ing">50g/1¾oz/4 tbsp butter</p>

  <p class="ing">1 garlic clove, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing">a handful of parsley, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing2">grated zest of ½ lemon</p>

  <p class="step">Using kitchen scissors, slightly snip the skin around the veal shins (this is done to prevent the meat from curling up during cooking). Dust the meat with flour, shake off any excess and set aside.</p>

  <p class="step">Heat the butter and oil in a large saucepan, add the onion and carrot and gently sweat until softened. Increase the heat to medium, add the veal shins and brown on both sides. Add the wine and allow to evaporate. Season with salt and pepper, add the stock, reduce the heat, partially cover with a lid and cook on a low heat for 1½ hours, or until the meat is tender.</p>

  <p class="step">Meanwhile, prepare the gremolada by combining all the ingredients together.</p>

  <p class="step">When the veal is cooked, remove from the heat and leave to rest for 5 minutes. Sprinkle with the gremolada and serve.</p>

  <div class="box">

  <p class="image"><a id="page_79"/><img alt="Illustration" src="../Images/f0079-01.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="chap-para">This dish from the Lombardy region of northern Italy was traditionally made on the feast of Saint Anthony on 17 January to mark the end of the pig slaughtering season. No part of the pig was ever wasted and the cheaper cuts, such as trotters, skin, ears, nose, ribs and tail, were used to make this stew – the better parts were for curing into hams and salami. This dish is still popular today and I have adapted it with more readily available cuts of pork. Serve with runny polenta (cornmeal), as they do in Lombardy, or mashed potatoes for a perfect winter warmer. The addition of Parmesan rind gives the stew an extra bit of flavour. When you finish a piece of Parmesan, don’t discard the rind; wrap it in clingfilm (plastic wrap) and store in the fridge to add to soups and stews.</p>

  <p class="chap-para">This hearty lamb stew with butternut squash and potato is full of colour – orange from the squash, yellow from saffron and a hint of red from tomato and chilli. Simple to prepare, this one-pot meal makes a delicious family meal or an informal dinner with friends.</p>

  <h3 class="h3a">Sweet and sour marinated rabbit</h3>

  <p class="image"><a id="page_85"/><img alt="Illustration" src="../Images/f0085-01.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="chap-para">I love rabbit and can’t understand why it is not more widely available. The meat is tender, light and very digestible; in Italy, rabbit is given to weaning babies, convalescents and the elderly. You can order rabbit from good butchers, or if, like me, you shoot, the countryside is full of them. I often marinate rabbit because it rids the meat of that slightly gamey taste it can have; it can be marinated the day before and left in the fridge overnight. Once cooked, the rabbit is finished with a tangy sweet and sour sauce, giving the meat a real kick. Delicious served with slices of toasted country bread. If you prefer, chicken can be substituted for the rabbit.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing">1kg/2lb 4oz rabbit pieces on the bone, cleaned with a damp cloth</p>

  <p class="ing">plain (all-purpose) flour, to dust</p>

  <p class="ing">5 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing">1 small onion, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing">5 tbsp vegetable stock</p>

  <p class="ing">2 bay leaves</p>

  <p class="ing">8 black peppercorns</p>

  <p class="ing">1 garlic clove, left whole</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tsp thyme leaves</p>

  <p class="ing">salt</p>

  <p class="ing-head">for the agrodolce</p>

  <p class="ing">20g/¾oz/1½ tbsp caster (superfine) sugar</p>

  <p class="ing">a knob of butter</p>

  <p class="ing">4 tbsp red wine vinegar</p>

  <p class="ing">30g/1oz/3 tbsp sultanas (golden raisins), soaked in lukewarm water for about 20 minutes, then drained</p>

  <p class="ing2">15g/½oz/2 tbsp pine nuts</p>

  <p class="step">Put all the marinade ingredients in a small saucepan and bring to the boil, then remove from the heat and leave to cool. Put the rabbit in a dish, pour over the marinade, cover with clingfilm (plastic wrap) and leave in the fridge for at least 2 hours.</p>

  <p class="step">Remove the rabbit from the marinade, pat dry and dust with flour.</p>

  <p class="step">Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan, add the onion and sweat for a minute, then add the rabbit and brown all over. Pour over the marinade and cook on a low heat, uncovered, for about 15 minutes until the liquid has evaporated. Add salt, pepper and stock, cover with a lid and cook for 25 minutes on a medium–low heat until the rabbit is cooked through and the sauce has reduced.</p>

  <p class="step1">Meanwhile, for the agrodolce, put the sugar and 2 tablespoons water in a small saucepan on a medium heat and stir until the sugar has dissolved. Stir in the butter until melted, then the vinegar and sultanas and bring to the boil for a minute. Pour this over the cooked rabbit, mixing it with the sauce, sprinkle with the pine nuts and serve.</p>

  <h3 class="h3a">Venison casserole</h3>

  <p class="image"><a id="page_87"/><img alt="Illustration" src="../Images/f0087-01.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="chap-para">Scottiglia is a slow-cooked Tuscan stew or casserole that is usually made with whatever the hunter has managed to catch, so you could substitute wild boar, rabbit or hare for the venison in this recipe. Many supermarkets now sell farmed venison; ‘casserole venison’ is cut up ready for stewing. The meat is first marinated overnight for maximum tenderness and flavour and then slow-cooked for a rich-tasting casserole. Delicious served with runny polenta (cornmeal).</p>

  <p class="ing1">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing">1kg/2lb 4oz venison haunch or casserole venison, cut into 4–5 cm/1½–2-inch chunks</p>

  <h3 class="h3a">Hunter’s chicken</h3>

  <p class="image"><a id="page_88"/><img alt="Illustration" src="../Images/f0088-01.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="chap-para">This classic Italian dish is renowned all over the world and often seen on the menus of Italian restaurants. The title <em>alla cacciatora</em> (‘in the style of the hunter’) suggests it was probably first made with game birds or rabbit. However, as with many Italian dishes, it also has roots in the <em>cucina povera</em>, when people used whatever meagre ingredients they had to hand; in this case, a chicken or, more likely, an old hen, was slaughtered for a special occasion and, to make it go further, enriched with whatever vegetables and herbs were available in the garden as well as a splash of homemade wine. It is made all over Italy and here I have recreated it in the way it is normally made in my region of Campania, using lots of herbs and fresh tomatoes. I like to serve this rustic dish with slices of toasted country bread drizzled with extra virgin olive oil.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing">750g/1lb 10oz chicken thighs and drumsticks</p>

  <p class="ing">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="ing">3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing">1 large onion, finely sliced</p>

  <p class="ing">1 garlic clove, crushed and left whole</p>

  <p class="ing">1 small red chilli, sliced</p>

  <p class="ing">2 sprigs of rosemary</p>

  <p class="ing">2 sprigs of thyme</p>

  <p class="ing">a handful of parsley, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ing">2 bay leaves</p>

  <p class="ing">4 sage leaves</p>

  <p class="ing">125ml/4fl oz/½ cup dry white wine</p>

  <p class="ing">1½ tbsp tomato purée (paste), dissolved in 3 tbsp lukewarm water</p>

  <p class="ing2">175g/6oz cherry tomatoes, halved</p>

  <p class="step">Rub the chicken pieces all over with salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan, add the chicken and seal well all over.</p>

  <p class="step">Add the onion, garlic, chilli and herbs and cook for a couple of minutes on a medium heat. Add the wine, increase the heat and allow the wine to evaporate slightly. Add the diluted tomato purée, then stir in the cherry tomatoes. Reduce the heat to low, cover with a lid and cook gently for 1¼ hours, until the chicken is cooked through; the flesh should come away from the bone and there should be no sign of pink when you pierce the thickest part. Serve hot.</p>

  <p class="image"><a id="page_91"/><img alt="Illustration" src="../Images/f0091-01.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="chap-para">This simple but very tasty vegetable stew puts the flavours and colours of the Mediterranean on a plate. The slow, gentle cooking brings all the flavours of the vegetables and other ingredients together. I like to make this with lots of chilli and serve with couscous for a light but nutritious meal. It can be made in advance and in summer can be eaten cold if desired. Although it uses what I consider to be summer vegetables, it can be made at any time of the year.</p>

  <p class="ing1">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing">4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing">2 red onions, finely sliced</p>

  <p class="ing">2 celery stalks with leaves, sliced</p>

  <p class="ing">3 garlic cloves, sliced</p>

  <p class="ing">1 red chilli, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ing">5 anchovy fillets</p>

  <p class="ing">1 tbsp capers</p>

  <p class="ing">140g/5oz/¾ cup green olives</p>

  <p class="ing">1 red (bell) pepper, cut into thick slices</p>

  <p class="ing">1 yellow (bell) pepper, thickly sliced</p>

  <p class="ing">1 aubergine (eggplant), cut into chunks</p>

  <p class="ing">200g/7oz green beans, sliced in half</p>

  <p class="ing">3 tbsp dry white wine</p>

  <p class="ing">300g/10½oz cherry tomatoes, halved</p>

  <p class="ing">a handful of basil leaves</p>

  <p class="ing2">salt</p>

  <p class="step">Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan, add the onions, celery, garlic and chilli and sweat on a medium heat for a couple of minutes. Add the anchovy fillets and stir with a wooden spoon until dissolved. Add the capers and olives. Stir in the peppers, aubergine, courgettes and beans. Add the wine and allow to evaporate. Add the tomatoes, basil leaves and a pinch of salt. Reduce the heat, cover with a lid and cook gently for 1 hour. Serve with couscous.</p>
