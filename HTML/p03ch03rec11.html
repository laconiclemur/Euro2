<p class="summary1">Bread has always been an important part of a Spanish meal. I telephoned Rosa Tovar, who wrote a book about bread, to find out more about it. In Cervantes’s <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span>, there is a scene where Sancho Panza says that he has seen Dulcinea eating bread that was “not very white,” which implied that she was poor. Today the most common traditional breads are big round loaves made with wheat flour. The <span class="italic">libreta</span> (from <span class="italic">libra</span>, pound, because it weighs one pound) is the finest and whitest. The <span class="italic">hogaza</span>, a country bread, is rougher and not quite white. Bakeries (<span class="italic">panaderías</span>) and markets in Galicia, Asturias, and the Basque Country sell corn and rye breads, as well as their usual wheat loaves. Catalans and others in Mediterranean Spain eat dense, coarse-textured round loaves cut in thick slices, which they sprinkle with extra virgin olive oil or rub with tomatoes. But the most common bread now throughout the whole of Spain is a crusty baguette-style loaf that is a bit denser than a French baguette. It is called <span class="italic">pistola</span> in Madrid and <span class="italic">pan de barra</span> elsewhere.</p>
