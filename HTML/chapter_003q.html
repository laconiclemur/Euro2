<h2 class="h2b">LA DAUBE NIÇOISE</h2>
<p class="normalla"><em>Each region of France has its own version of daube, from</em> boeuf bourguignon <em>to</em> boeuf bordelais. <em>In the Provençal version the addition of orange zest, tomato and, if you like, black olives, makes it stand out from the rest</em>.</p>
<p class="normalla"><em>This is a completely different way of marinating and cooking a daube than most of you will be used to. It is quicker and more practical than most recipes, and you really have to try it to experience the results for yourselves. The large pieces of beef are vital as there is more to caramelise, the darkened juicy outsides adding more flavour without drying. The hot wine penetrates more in an hour than cold, uncooked wine would in days, and nothing is added to the marinade so that you have nothing to scrape off when you have to fry the meat. The aromatics added to the pot will impart their flavour as much as is needed. One notable absentee is the bacon or</em> coin de porc <em>or anything of the like, which particularly if smoked just overpowers all the other flavours</em>.</p>
<p class="normalla"><em>Having the oven at so low a temperature will cook the beef gently, below simmering point, so the finished dish is moist, tender and full of flavour. This is the secret: you can’t cook a daube or stew too slowly, but at too high a temperature the beef will be tough and dry. If you don’t have a saucepan to fry in and use in the oven, caramelise the pieces of beef first in a frying pan, then transfer them to a casserole, continuing afterwards in batches with all of the ingredients</em>.</p>
<p class="normalla0"><em>Don’t make the daube on the day of eating: it keeps perfectly in the fridge for at least three days. Some say it tastes better the longer it is left, but I think this is probably because it’s already made – you have a practically dish-free kitchen, but can still enjoy the wonderful aromas. When reheating, do so very slowly so the beef just warms through without toughening or drying out</em>.</p>
<div class="hang0">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
12 × 80–100g (3–3½ oz) pieces of shin (or if you are really lucky, cheek) of beef<br/>
1 bottle robust red wine<br/>
50ml (2fl oz) groundnut oil<br/>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>
30g (1¼ oz) butter<br/>
16 large shallots, peeled<br/>
8 garlic cloves, peeled<br/>
1 heaped tbsp tomato concentrate<br/>
2 tomatoes, roughly chopped<br/>
2 heaped tbsp plain flour<br/>
30g (1¼ oz) dried ceps<br/>
2 bay leaves and 2 sprigs fresh thyme or savory tied together<br/>
4 strips Dried Orange Zest (<em><a href="chapter_006j.html#page173">see here</a></em>)</p>
</div>
<div class="hang00">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">TO FINISH</span><br/>
Finely grated zest of 1 orange<br/>
2 large ripe tomatoes, seeded and diced<br/>
12 large black olives, stoned and chopped<br/>
3 large sprigs fresh savory or thyme, leaves picked from the stalks, chopped</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Put the chunks of beef into a bowl or container that just holds them. Reduce the wine by two-thirds as quickly as possible and pour over the beef. Cover and leave the beef to marinate for an hour or so, turning it occasionally.</p>
<p class="normala">Preheat your oven to 110°C/225°F/Gas ¼.</p>
<p class="normala">Pour the beef and marinade into a colander over a bowl and press to extract all the wine. Reserve the wine and dry the pieces of beef well on kitchen paper.</p>
<p class="normala">Heat the groundnut oil in a large ovenproof pan. Season the beef with salt then sear and colour in a single layer for 5 minutes. Do more than one batch if necessary. Add the butter then caramelise slowly for a further 5 minutes or so, never allowing the butter to burn and turning the beef occasionally so that it colours evenly.</p>
<p class="normala">Pour off half the fat, then add the shallots, garlic, tomato concentrate and tomatoes and cook over your highest heat for about 2 minutes until well browned. Spoon in the flour and stir well, then pour in the red wine marinade along with just enough water to cover. Bring to the boil and skim, add the dried ceps, bouquet garni and orange zest, then place into the preheated oven to braise for 3 hours, making absolutely sure that the liquid never boils. Check the meat: it should be tender, still moist and flaky enough to eat with a spoon. If not, just leave it to cook for a while longer. Be confident, it will happen.</p>
<p class="normala">Remove the beef from the oven, discard the bouquet garni and orange zest and gently, with a slotted spoon, transfer the beef, shallots and garlic to a tray in a single layer. Strain the cooking juices through a sieve into a clean saucepan. Reduce over a high heat by about a third until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, and add the beef, shallots and garlic back to it. Season well; you’ll probably need lots of sugar and black pepper to balance the wine. Sprinkle with the topping and serve.</p>
