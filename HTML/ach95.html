<p class="author1"><span class="txit">riso con pomodoro</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This is a dish my grandmother served as a quick no-meat supper on Friday evenings. It has a creamy texture and is quite filling. It was not enough of a meal for my grandfather, however, so he would follow it with some my grandmother’s fresh baked bread, olives, slices of provolone, and a salad.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup long-grain rice</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups cold water</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups <a class="nounder" href="ach58.html#page_119">Joan’s Basic Tomato Sauce</a> prepared with green bell peppers</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Freshly grated Parmesan or pecorino Romano cheese for garnish (optional)</span></p>
<p class="noindenta">Place the rice and water in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the rice until it is tender and all of the water has been absorbed, about 20 minutes. Stir the tomato sauce into the cooked rice. Cook the rice mixture over low heat to blend the flavors, about 5 minutes. Serve hot, topped with cheese if desired.</p>
