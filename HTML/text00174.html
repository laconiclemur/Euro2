<p class="first_paragraph" id="nad0001400">I firmly believe that everything in life should end with something sweet. I grew up in a house where we never got dessert after dinner. My dad was an avid eater of fruit. He would wash the microwave plate (because he didn’t have another plate big enough) and chop up all the fruit that was really overripe, so he didn’t have to throw it away. I’m sure he wanted us to be healthy, but it was also because he had an eye for a bargain, and would buy reduced food even if it was almost rotting. Don’t get me wrong: we always had delicious sweet exotic fruits like sharon fruit, physalis, pineapple, mango, jackfruit, all of which do taste better very ripe. But really all we wanted was some pudding. That’s probably why we loved school dinners so much. There was nothing nicer than filling your belly with warm Victoria sponge and strawberry custard just before double maths. In this chapter I share the pudding recipes that frequently fill the bellies of the wonderful people in my life – and I know when they eat these they smile from the inside. (Quite a different feeling to having very ripe fruit on your inside!)</p>
