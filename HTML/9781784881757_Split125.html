<p class="tx2"><b>Tuscans cook vegetables with care and respect. They are never dressed with anything to embarrass or overwhelm their delicate flavours. In fact, vegetables are often scantily clad in nothing but a slick of young olive oil and a shimmer of salt. As an ex-vegetarian, I will pass on a tip from my travels in Italy: don’t expect sumptuous vegetarian offerings for main courses. Instead, go straight to <i>contorni</i> and make a selection of dishes from there.</b></p>
