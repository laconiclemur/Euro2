		</div>
		<div class="basic-text-frame">
			<p class="rec-intro">This is a very simple but effective vegetable terrine that makes a lovely light starter with some goat’s cheese or the goat’s cheese cream suggested here. If you can’t find goat’s curd, use a soft goat’s cheese and mash it with the crème fraiche. </p>

		<div class="basic-text-frame">
			<p class="serves">Serves 12–14</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">salt </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">pinch of sugar</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">20 medium leeks, trimmed, washed and left whole</p>
			<p class="for-the">goat’s cheese cream</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">180g soft goat’s curd</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">100g crème fraiche</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 tbsp chopped chives</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">olive oil</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">salt</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">black pepper</p>
		</div>
		<div class="basic-text-frame">
			<p class="body">Bring a large pan of water to the boil and season with a generous amount of salt and a little sugar. Add the leeks and cook them for 10–12 minutes or until tender. Check with the point of a knife – it should pierce the leeks easily. When the leeks are ready, carefully remove them from the pan and drain them on a rack so they keep their shape. </p>
			<p class="body">Line a terrine dish measuring about 24 x 8cm with a double layer of cling film, leaving plenty of cling film overlapping the sides. Place the whole leeks in the terrine, arranging them head to tail so you get alternating strips of green and white in the terrine. Wrap the overlapping cling film tightly over the top and pierce it a few times with the point of a knife. </p>
			<p class="body">Now you need to weigh down the terrine to press out the excess water. The ideal way of doing this is to place another terrine of exactly the same size inside the first dish and weigh that down with heavy weights. Alternatively, place a small board inside the terrine, covering the leeks, and put a weight on top. It does need to be really heavy to press out the water. Place the whole thing on a tray to catch the water and leave in the fridge overnight. </p>
			<p class="body">The next day, carefully turn the terrine out on to a serving dish and cut it into slices with a sharp knife. Serve with the goat’s cheese cream or simply with a beautiful goat’s cheese.</p>
			<p class="body">To make the goat’s cheese cream, mash the goat’s curd with the crème fraiche until smooth and light, then season with salt, pepper, chopped chives and a drizzle of olive oil.</p>
