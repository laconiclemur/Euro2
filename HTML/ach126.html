<p class="author1"><span class="txit">filetto di bue al prosciutto</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This dish is very good when served with <a class="nounder" href="ach114.html#page_224">Mashed Potatoes and Artichokes</a>. Domestically cured prosciutto may be purchased for this recipe; because it will be roasted along with the meat, there is no need to purchase an imported brand. You may even use pancetta or American bacon instead.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 large carrot, halved lengthwise and cut into 2-inch pieces</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 medium-size onion, quartered</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 celery stalks, halved lengthwise and cut into 2-inch pieces</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">One 2<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>- to 3-pound beef tenderloin or Chateaubriand</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon coarsely chopped fresh rosemary leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon coarsely chopped fresh sage leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">12 very thin slices prosciutto</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup dry red wine</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup chicken broth</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Preheat oven to 500° F. Grease a small roasting or baking pan—one that will hold the beef snugly—with the oil.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Arrange the carrot, onion, and celery on the bottom of the prepared pan. Place a wire rack in the pan and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Rub the beef all over with the mustard. Sprinkle the rosemary, sage, and salt and pepper to taste all over the beef. Place 6 to 8 slices of the prosciutto, slightly overlapping, on a clean work surface. Place the beef on top of the prosciutto. Wrap the prosciutto up and over, and use the remaining slices of prosciutto to completely enclose the beef. Secure the prosciutto around the beef by gently tying the roast with butcher’s string.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_245"/><span class="red">4.</span> Place the roast on the rack and cook in the oven until browned on top, about 15 minutes. Turn the roast and continue cooking until browned and medium-rare, about 15 minutes more. (An internal thermometer should register about 130° F for medium-rare beef.) Transfer the meat to a platter and set aside to rest for 10 minutes before removing and discarding the string. Carve into 1-inch-thick slices.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> Meanwhile, set the roasting pan over high heat (or transfer the contents to a wide saucepan). Stir in the flour, wine, and broth, bring to a boil, and cook, stirring constantly, to slightly thicken the juices in the pan, about 5 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve and spoon over the sliced roast.</p>
