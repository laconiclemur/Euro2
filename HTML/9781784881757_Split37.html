<h1 class="chapter"><a id="page_59a"/>babbo’s eggs</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>This is one of our favourite breakfasts in the Caldesi household. We all like to eat it and it is easy to rustle up before the kids head out to school. It has a long history: Giancarlo’s father used to concoct it for himself after an early morning start in the fields as a mid-morning breakfast. In the Tuscan dialect ‘daddy’ is <i>babbo</i>, hence the name. We always have a plastic box of tomato sauce in the fridge so it is quick to put together.</b></p>

<p class="hang"><b>300 g (10½ oz) <a href="9781784881757_Split22.html#page_40">Homemade Tomato Sauce</a></b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>4 eggs</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt and freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>small handful of parsley, finely chopped (optional)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>toasted bread, to serve (optional)</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Pour the sauce into a large frying pan and warm over a medium heat. Crack the eggs into the sauce in 4 places, keeping them separate from one another if your pan is large enough. Season the eggs with salt and pepper and cover the pan with a lid. Continue to cook for around 5 minutes or until the eggs are done to your liking. Serve on its own, scattered with parsley, or with toasted bread.</p>
