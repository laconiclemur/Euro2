			<p class="rec-intro">Rillettes can be made from many different meats but this recipe is one of my favourites. You can vary the seasoning if you like by adding ingredients such as green peppercorns or toasted pistachios. I like to serve these rillettes straight from a glass parfait jar, but if you are feeling in the mood for something fancy, shape them into neat quenelles with a tablespoon.</p>

			<p class="ing-nu">1.2kg pork back fat</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">about 2 litres water</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">bouquet garni, made up of celery, leek, 2 bay leaves, parsley stalks and thyme (see <a href="part0010_split_038.html#Chef-s-notes" class="calibre4">here</a>)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 onion, peeled and studded with 2 cloves</p>

			<p class="body">Cut the pork back fat into small cubes, put these in a large saucepan and cover with plenty of water – about 2 litres. Simmer for about an hour, until the fat has softened and become translucent, and the water has evaporated. Add the bouquet garni, onion, carrot, garlic, bacon and 375ml of the white wine. Season generously with salt, pepper and a grating of nutmeg – when cold, the rillettes will taste bland if not slightly over seasoned now.</p>
			<p class="body">Add the rabbit and diced pork to the pan and stir well. Cover with a piece of baking parchment paper and turn down the heat so the mixture is barely simmering. Cook for about 2 hours, stirring occasionally, until the meat is so soft that it crumbles.</p>
			<p class="body">Take the pan off the heat and pour the mixture into a clean bowl set over ice. Add 200ml more wine and stir vigorously with a spatula until cold. The rillette mixture will change colour and turn opaque-white from the emulsified fat. Put the rillettes into jars or a terrine dish and store in the fridge. It will keep for 2–3 weeks. Serve with hot toast and cornichons. </p>
