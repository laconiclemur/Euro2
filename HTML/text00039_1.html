 CREAMY BROCCOLI &amp; OREGANO PASTA</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_blue" id="nad0002710">
<em>Mmmmmm, creamy pasta. Not like the stuff from a packet that was dished up for school dinners or the stuff that comes out of a tin. The real deal. Quick, easy and delicious, three of my favourite traits where cooking is involved. When this first appeared on their plates, everyone else in my household was not so sure. But I wasn’t having any of it. ‘The kitchen is not a restaurant,’ I said. ‘You will eat what you are given.’ That was to the 10-year-old, the 9-year-old, the 6-year-old AND the 35-year-old! I still thought they would take some convincing but – who knew! – hand your family a plate of cream and garlic, mix in some oregano and pasta, and suddenly they stop complaining!</em>

<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Put a large pan of salted water on to boil. Once it’s boiling, add the pasta and cook according to the instructions on the packet. Or if you’re a dab hand at pasta boiling, cook the pasta to your personal taste. During the last 2 minutes of cooking, add the broccoli.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002721">
<span class="blue">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Meanwhile, pour the cream into a small pan, add the garlic cloves and place on a medium heat. Cook the cream for 4–5 minutes, until it has reduced by just under half and has thickened.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002722">
<span class="blue">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Use a fork to find the garlic cloves in the pan and crush them with the back of the fork against the side of the pan. Add the oregano and Parmesan, stir and keep warm.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002723">
<span class="blue">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Drain the spaghetti and broccoli, keeping the cooking water.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002724">
<span class="blue">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Add the spaghetti and broccoli to the thickened cream mixture, season and stir. If the mixture is a little dry, add a splash of the cooking water.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0002725">
<span class="blue">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Grate some lemon zest on top of each plate as you serve it. This will cut through the creaminess. I like to just grate it on top at the end, so it doesn’t mix in and get lost among everything else.</p>
