<h3 class="h3b"><a id="page_21"/>roasted bell peppers</h3>
<p class="author1"><span class="txit">peperoni arrostiti</span></p>
<p class="noindent">When we were selecting recipes to include in the book my mother came upon this simple preparation for roasted peppers. It brought to mind reminiscences of late summer days when she bottled tomatoes with her family. “We would all gather to pick the tomatoes, and then soak the ripe ones in a tub of water. Each tomato would then be cored and cut and put in a strainer to drain,” Joan explained. “When the strainer was full, we’d dump the tomatoes into a pillowcase that was hanging from a tree limb, salt them, and then squeeze the pillowcase with our hands to extract the excess water. With one pass through a machine to reduce the pulp to a thick, seedless, skinless liquid, we were ready to bottle our own rich tomato puree—each topped with a fresh basil leaf. The bottles were then boiled in a huge drum over an outdoor fireplace to seal and preserve the fresh summer tomatoes all winter long.”</p>
<p class="indentb">While waiting for the sauce to boil, Joan’s mother would roast fresh peppers over the coals and serve them to the family on toasted slices of homemade bread. I think they make a great complement to almost any sandwich. Also, if you have leftover pasta and not enough sauce, sauté garlic in some olive oil, add these peppers to heat them through, and toss this simple sauce over the pasta for a quick lunch dish.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">10 red bell peppers</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cloves garlic, quartered</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Preheat the oven broiler. Place a brown paper bag inside a plastic shopping bag and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Lay the peppers on their sides on an oven rack. Place a cookie sheet below the peppers to catch any juices. Broil the peppers, turning occasionally, until the skins are <a id="page_22"/>charred on all sides, including the tops and bottoms. Remove the peppers from the oven and immediately place them in the paper bag. Close the paper bag and the plastic bag around it, and allow the peppers to cool slightly, about 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Remove one of the peppers from the paper bag. Peel away and discard the charred skin, stem, and seeds. Tear the pepper lengthwise into <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>-inch-wide strips, and place the strips in a bowl. Continue with this procedure until all of the peppers have been peeled. Set the bowl aside for 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Drain off all but <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup of any liquid that may have accumulated in the bowl. Add the olive oil, garlic, salt to taste, and parsley to the bowl and toss to coat the peppers.</p>
<p class="serves"><span class="smallcaps">— SERVES 10 —</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">WINE PAIRING</span>:</span> Sparkling, medium white, light red, and rosé</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">NOTE</span>:</span> If you do not plan to serve these roasted peppers immediately, toss with the olive oil and place them in a jar. The peppers may then be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Bring to room temperature and add the remaining ingredients before serving.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Roasted peppers may also be frozen. Divide the peppers into two batches. Place in airtight containers or plastic freezer bags along with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil (or enough to cover) in each one. Freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw the peppers and then combine with the remaining <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup olive oil and the other ingredients before serving.</p>
