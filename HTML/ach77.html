<p class="author1"><span class="txit">linguine con topolini</span></p>
<p class="noindent">My grandfather Stanislao originated the recipe for these savory veal rolls. After your guests have eaten this delightful meal, you can inform them that <span class="txit">topolini</span> is the Italian word for “mice”! These rolls are the best when prepared several hours in advance and then slowly warmed through while the pasta is cooking. The veal and sauce may be cooled and refrigerated overnight or frozen for up to one month.</p>
<p class="indentb">Spoon the sauce onto the pasta and serve it as a first course, and then serve the veal rolls as a second course with a vegetable side dish. Or if you prefer, the pasta and veal rolls may be served together as one course.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> pounds veal scallops</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 cloves garlic, finely chopped</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">6 tablespoons finely chopped provolone cheese</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">6 tablespoons grated pecorino Romano cheese</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">6 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup dry white wine</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cups chicken broth</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup coarsely chopped tender celery leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> pounds linguine</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Freshly grated pecorino Romano cheese for garnish</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Cut the veal into squares measuring about 3 inches across. Pound each piece, flattening it to form a slightly larger square, about 4 inches.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Sprinkle each veal square with equal portions of the garlic. Then sprinkle with about 1 teaspoon each of the provolone, pecorino Romano, and parsley, placing these ingredients near one edge of each piece of veal. Season with salt and pepper. Roll each square tightly to make a small sausage shape. Tie snugly with butcher’s string.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_149"/><span class="red">3.</span> Warm the olive oil in a large frying pan set over a medium-high heat. When the oil is hot but not smoking, add half the veal rolls and cook until well browned on all sides, about 8 minutes. Remove the veal to a plate and set aside. Cook the remaining veal rolls in the same manner, remove to the plate, and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Add the wine and stir, loosening any pieces of meat that may have been stuck to the bottom of the pan. Add the chicken broth and celery leaves to the pan and cook, stirring constantly, to soften slightly, about 2 minutes. Return the veal rolls to the pan along with any juice that has accumulated on the plate. Bring to a boil and then simmer gently until the meat is cooked through, about 20 minutes. Turn the veal rolls two or three times while they cook to keep them evenly moist.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the linguine and cook until al dente, following the package instructions. Drain the pasta and return it to the pot. Spoon a small amount of the veal sauce onto the pasta and toss.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">6.</span> Distribute the pasta equally among six plates. Top with more sauce and serve, garnishing with freshly grated pecorino Romano cheese.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">7.</span> Serve the veal as a second course, removing the strings and spooning any remaining sauce over the meat.</p>

Slice each breast in thirds horizontally, creating three thin slices. Cut and pound the chicken as necessary to achieve the recommended dimensions given for the veal. Proceed with the basic recipe.</p>
