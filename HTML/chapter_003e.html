<h2 class="h2b" id="page78">SOUPE AU PISTOU</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Vegetable Soup with Basil</em></h3>
<p class="normall"><em>This is the soup that inspired minestrone – just ask any Italian – but it’s a vegetable soup by any name you like, with a great burst of basil at the end. I like to cook it very quickly and vary the vegetables, choosing whichever are freshest and best. You need not have as many varieties as I do: a couple from under and a few from above the ground will suffice</em>.</p>
<p class="normalla0"><em>Serving it one afternoon to some deeply rooted Provençaux, I explained with a grin how I deviated rather a lot from the traditional recipe: I used no pasta (they cringed), I cooked it quickly (they frowned), but look, it’s bright green (air was noisily sucked between varying amounts of teeth). A few shrugs later, when it was decided that I was young, therefore foolish and rash with plenty of time to see the error of my ways, they dipped their spoons. They all declared themselves famished when asking for seconds – no breakfast, lots of work today, etc… Allow a moment or two of smugness before serving</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 6</span><br/>
1kg (2lb 4oz) borlotti beans, about 400g (14oz) shelled weight (optional)<br/>
2 small leeks, washed and finely sliced<br/>
1 large white onion, peeled and roughly chopped<br/>
4 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced<br/>
1 large carrot, peeled and chopped<br/>
1 large potato, peeled and chopped<br/>
1 large turnip, peeled and chopped<br/>
6 tbsp olive oil<br/>
1 large courgette, diced<br/>
1kg (2lb 4oz) broad beans, about 300g (10½oz) shelled weight, blanched<br/>
250g (9oz) fat green beans, blanched and chopped<br/>
Salt and freshly ground pepper<br/>
4 tomatoes, seeded and diced<br/>
100g (3½oz) <em>Pistou</em> (<em><a href="chapter_006f.html#page170">see here</a></em>)</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">First cook the borlotti beans well covered with water at slightly lower than simmering point for about 40 minutes until they are tender. In the meantime, sweat the leeks, onion, garlic, carrot, potato and turnip in a large shallow pan in the olive oil for 5 minutes or so. Cover with water, boil for 5 minutes, then add the courgettes and boil for another 5 minutes, topping up the water if necessary until the vegetables are soft. Add all the cooked beans and bring back to the boil. Season well, then finish with the tomato and <em>pistou</em> at the very last minute.</p>
