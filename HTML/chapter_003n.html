<h2 class="h2b">MORUE A LA BENEDICTINE (BRANDADE)</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Salt Cod Purée</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>A completely traditional</em> brandade <em>is just salt cod, garlic, olive oil and milk, but it is mostly served these days with mashed potato added. Legend has it that this recipe is so named after a monk, who was making a (potato-less)</em> brandade <em>for his fellow worshippers. All of a sudden there was a knock on the door and up turned a few fellows from a neighbouring monastery. The cheerful monk-cook did not panic. He put a great pot of potatoes on to boil, mashed them and added them to the fish, to the immense delight of his visitors who scraped their bowls and insisted on taking the recipe</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
600g (1lb 5oz) salt cod<br/>
4 large garlic cloves, peeled and halved<br/>
1 bouquet garni<br/>
500g (1lb 2oz) old waxy potatoes, peeled and chopped<br/>
500g (1lb 2oz) small new potatoes, sliced 1cm (½ in) thick and parboiled<br/>
3 tbsp vegetable oil<br/>
250ml (9fl oz) whipping cream<br/>
125ml (4fl oz) extra virgin olive oil<br/>
Cayenne pepper<br/>
1 bunch fresh parsley, leaves picked from the stalks, sliced</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 180°C/350°F/Gas 4.</p>
<p class="normala">Sit the salt cod on a small rack then soak it in as big a container of water as you can muster, changing the water at least four times in 24 hours.</p>
<p class="normala">Give the cod a good rinse, put it in a pan that just holds it, cover it with water and add the garlic and bouquet garni. Bring it to the boil and simmer very gently for 20 minutes. While this is cooking boil the waxy potatoes until soft. Leave them in the hot water.</p>
<p class="normala">Once the cod is cooked pick out any bones and purée the flesh in the food processor. Strain and mash the potatoes then mix together with the cod in a saucepan.</p>
<p class="normala">Sauté the parboiled new potatoes until golden in the vegetable oil. Add the cream and olive oil to the <em>brandade</em> and season with a little cayenne. Toss the parsley through the sautéed potatoes, spread on top of the <em>brandade</em> and serve.</p>
