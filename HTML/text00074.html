 CLOVE &amp; SQUASH RISOTTO</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_green" id="nad0003344">
<em>I’m certainly no expert at cooking risotto but I do love making it. It’s a little more time-consuming than other rice dishes, but the finished dish is well worth the wait. Risotto is all about standing in front of the stove and watching your dish as it transforms, and this recipe is no different. The sweet squash is complemented by the addition of ground cloves, mixed with the slow-cooked risotto grains and the tang of Parmesan. It’s the perfect opportunity to stand at the stove and have a chat on the phone to someone whom you haven’t spoken to for a while.</em>

<p class="method" id="nad0003356">
<span class="green">
<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Place a frying pan on a medium heat and add the oil. When the oil has warmed up, add the squash, followed by the ground cloves and salt, and cook gently for 15–20 minutes, until the squash has softened.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003357">
<span class="green">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Meanwhile, put the stock into a pan on the hob and bring to the boil. Once it has boiled, leave it to simmer.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003358">
<span class="green">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 To make the risotto you will need a wide non-stick pan. Place it on a medium heat and add the butter.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003359">
<span class="green">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Once the butter has melted, go ahead and add the chopped onion and cook for about 5 minutes, till it is soft but not browned.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003360">
<span class="green">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Now add the risotto rice. Cook on a high heat for 2 minutes, then turn the heat back down to medium.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003361">
<span class="green">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Add a ladle of the hot stock to the rice and stir until all the liquid has been absorbed. Keep doing this until the rice is soft but still has a little bite in the middle. This should take about 18–20 minutes. But it’s the perfect time for a catch-up. Get on that blower!</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003362">
<span class="green">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Once all the stock has been added and the rice is soft, stir in the cooked squash.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003363">
<span class="green">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 Add the grated Parmesan and mix through. If the risotto has stiffened too much, add a splash more stock to loosen it a little.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003364">
<span class="green">
<strong>9.</strong>
</span>
 Check the seasoning and garnish the risotto with rocket leaves and olive oil.</p>
