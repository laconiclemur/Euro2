 PEANUT BUTTER CHOCOLATE STACK</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_blue" id="nad0001758">
<em>My husband Abdal and I ate something very full of peanut butter a long time ago and he has been asking me to make something similar for a while. Did I give him what he wanted? Of course, even though I had a million other things to bake and a million other ideas to create. But writing the recipes for this chapter seemed like the perfect opportunity to satisfy his peanut butter needs.</em>

<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6. Grease the base and sides of two 23 x 33cm Swiss roll tins. Line with baking paper.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001779">
<span class="blue">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Put the eggs and sugar into the bowl of a mixer and beat for about 8 minutes till lighter in colour and tripled in volume. Lift the beaters and swirl the mixture in a figure of 8 – if the shape remains on the surface for more than 8 seconds, the eggs are ready.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001780">
<span class="blue">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Sift together the flour, cocoa powder and baking powder, then fold into the egg mix using a metal spoon, making sure not to lose all the air you worked so hard to create. When no more flour particles can be seen, divide the mixture between the two tins, easing it into the corners.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001781">
<span class="blue">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Bake the cakes for 10 minutes. Once ready, turn them out of the tins, using the paper to help, and leave to cool on a wire rack.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001782">
<span class="blue">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 To make the ganache, put the chocolate chips into a bowl. Bring the cream to the boil in a small pan, pour it over the chocolate and give it a stir. Allow the heat of the cream to gently melt the chocolate. Stir again after 5 minutes and you should have a glossy smooth ganache. Set aside to cool.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001783">
<span class="blue">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 To make the caramel, put the butter and sugar into a pan on a medium heat. Once the sugar has melted, add the condensed milk and turn the heat up to high, making sure to stir all the time.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001784">
<span class="blue">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Bring the mixture to the boil, then cook for 2 minutes on a high heat. Take off the heat, stir in the salt and cream, and set aside to cool. Once the mixture has thickened to a spreading consistency, transfer to a bowl to cool.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001785">
<span class="blue">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 Ensure all the components are completely cool before starting to assemble. Peel the paper off the cakes and cut them both down the middle vertically, to get 4 long thin rectangles. Spread the first slice with peanut butter, then with ganache. Chill for a few minutes before adding a layer of caramel.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001786">
<span class="blue">
<strong>9.</strong>
</span>
 Top with the next layer of cake and repeat the fillings, till you have three layers of filling and the fourth layer of cake is on top. Dust the cake with cocoa powder and cut into long thin slices.</p>
