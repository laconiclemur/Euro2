<p class="image"><a id="page_34"/><a id="page_35"/><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig00.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Gravlaks is a uniquely Scandinavian contribution to world cuisine, a way of preparing fish that is unlike anything else. While smoked salmon or dry-cured ham are variations on an almost universal theme, gravlaks is more difficult to categorize. The fish is not salty enough to be classified as salt-cured, nor is it cooked, but there is no mistaking it for raw fish dishes such as Japanese sushi or Mexican ceviche.</p>
<p class="indent">Today gravlaks is one of the most elegant and chic ways to serve up salmon. When someone puts a plate of thinly sliced gravlaks on the table, it is a sign of good taste, refinement, and appreciation of the guest. Yet, unlike many types of cured or smoked fish, it does not require much work or any special equipment to make it yourself.</p>
<p class="indent">Gravlaks has not always been such an easily enjoyable food. Originally, eating it was more of an extreme sport than a gastronomical pleasure. The word <em>gravlaks</em> means, literally, “buried salmon,” and the first gravlaks <a id="page_38"/>was actually buried for the cure—wrapped in birchbark, placed in a hole in the ground, and covered with dirt. The salmon would spend several weeks or even months underground, and when unwrapped, it was almost inedible. But, as with cheese, the emphasis is on <em>almost.</em> The fermented fish made by the traditional gravlaks method can be compared to a mature raw milk cheese, with an odor that knocks you out. But, as with good cheese, its taste is milder. This hard-core version of gravlaks is today called <em>rakfisk</em> in Norway (where it can be made from a variety of fish) and <em>surströmming</em> in Sweden (made from herring), and it’s not a delicacy for the fainthearted.</p>
<p class="indent">Today, making gravlaks no longer involves burial or a long fermentation period. It is a simple process of curing the fish in salt and sugar, often with dill and aquavit or brandy. Unlike the traditional method for <em>rakfisk,</em> it takes no more than four days. What makes it so special is that the curing process encourages autolysis, a process in which the cells and tissues of the flesh break up (technically, they are digesting themselves). The result is a softness similar to that of cooked or cured fish but with a freshness that sets it apart from all other treated fish products.</p>
<p class="indent">There is an intrinsic generosity to making gravlaks. In order to obtain the perfect result, you have to make at least two pounds or more of it, the ideal being to use two 3-pound fillets. That is more than a normal family of four would eat in a week or two, so in Scandinavia it is customary to invite guests to share it, or to give away some of it to friends and neighbors.</p>
<p class="indent">Making gravlaks is traditionally a household duty allocated to men. It is difficult to discover why this has been a masculine exercise, but one possible explanation springs to mind: It is a process so simple that even the most kitchen-phobic cook can do it.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_39"/>Gravlaks with Sweet Mustard Sauce</h3>
<div class="blue">
<p class="noindent"><small><strong>TRADITIONAL GRAVLAKS IS MADE FROM TWO WHOLE SALMON FILLETS AND FLAVORED ONLY WITH SALT, SUGAR, DILL, AND PEPPER. IF THE FISH IS GOOD, THERE IS NOTHING BETTER. THE GRAVLAKS FOUND IN AMERICAN MARKETS IS NORMALLY VERY MILD, SOMETIMES SLIGHTLY SCENTED, OFTEN WITH DRIED DILL. FRESH DILL HAS A TASTE THAT IS DISCREET AND SUBTLE; IT FLAVORS THE SALMON NICELY WITHOUT COMPETING WITH THE FISH’S OWN FLAVORS.</strong></small></p>
</div>
<p class="noindents">SERVES 12 AS A MAIN COURSE, 20 AS AN APPETIZER</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Two 3-pound salmon fillets, skin on, any pinbones removed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup salt</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅔ cup sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh dill</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon dill seeds</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Sweet Mustard Sauce (<a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#ch02_rec1">recipe follows</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Rinse the fillets in cold water and pat them dry with paper towels. Combine the salt and sugar, and rub the flesh side of the fish with the mixture. Place one fillet skin side down in a deep dish just big enough to hold the fillets. Scatter the pepper, fresh dill, and dill seeds over it. Place the other fillet skin side up on top. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and place a heavy weight, such as two heavy dishes or a saucepan, on top of the fish. Refrigerate for 3 to 4 days, turning the fish every 12 hours and basting it with the brine that accumulates in the dish.</p>
<p class="noindentt">To serve, discard the brining liquid and brush off the dill. Slice the fish into thin slices on the diagonal with a sharp thin knife. The flesh from the tail will be leaner than the flesh from the belly. Serve with the mustard sauce.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindent">Some cookbooks suggest freezing the salmon before you prepare it, to get rid of harmful microorganisms; with modern hygienic treatment of fish, this should not be a big issue. If you do freeze it, do it <em>after</em> it has been cured. Some of the proteins that may be damaged when freezing fresh fish will have broken down in the cured fish, so gravlaks can stand up to freezing better than fresh salmon can. The gravlaks will keep for up to 1 week in the refrigerator.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Gravlaks is normally served as one of many cold dishes in a buffet or smorgasbord, as we did on <em>New Scandinavian Cooking</em> in the Christmas program from Røros.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Serve with Sweet Mustard Sauce and scrambled eggs and dark rye bread for open-faced sandwiches, or with pickles and capers.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="ch02_rec1"/>Sweet Mustard Sauce</h4>
<p class="noindents">MAKES 2 CUPS</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 tablespoons sweet grainy mustard, or to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 to 3 tablespoons Dijon mustard</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon sugar, or to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 to 2 tablespoons vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup vegetable oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 to 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh dill</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Combine the sweet mustard and 2 tablespoons of the Dijon mustard in a medium bowl. Add the sugar and 1 tablespoon of the vinegar. Gradually add the oil, whisking constantly. Adjust the flavors as necessary. The sauce should be neither overly sweet nor overly acidic. Add a little water if the sauce gets too thick. Stir in the chopped dill. It will keep, refrigerated, for 2 to 3 weeks.</p>

<p class="noindent">People tend to differ as to what the real, authentic food traditions are. These differences can cut across countries, regions, or even families (my wife and I can never agree on what to have for Christmas dinner). But on one subject, there is no disagreement among the people of Norway, Sweden, and Finland: Gravlaks should be served with a sweet mustard sauce.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_41"/>Spicy Gravlaks with Aquavit</h3>
<div class="blue">
<p class="noindent"><small><strong>A FEW DROPS OF AQUAVIT, THE SCANDINAVIAN LIQUOR MADE FROM POTATOES AND FLAVORED WITH CARAWAY, LEMON PEEL, ANISEED, AND FENNEL, WILL GIVE GRAVLAKS A RICH, SPICY TASTE (SCOTCH OR AN EAU-DE-VIE ARE ACCEPTABLE SUBSTITUTES).</strong></small></p>
</div>
<p class="noindents">SERVES 6 TO 8</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Two 1-pound salmon fillets, skin on, any pinbones removed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon caraway seeds</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons aniseed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 juniper berries</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes or 1 small dried hot red chile pepper, seeded and chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon black peppercorns</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons salt</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ tablespoons sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh dill</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons aquavit, brandy, eau-de-vie, or Scotch</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Rinse the fillets in cold water and pat them dry with paper towels. Crush the caraway seeds, aniseed, juniper berries, red pepper flakes, and black peppercorns using a mortar and pestle. Or place the spices on a cutting board or other hard surface and crush them with the underside of a heavy skillet. Combine with the salt, sugar, and dill.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Place one of the fillets skin side down in a deep dish just big enough to hold the fillets. Rub the fillet with half the spice and dill mixture. Rub the other fillet with the mixture and place it skin side up on top of the first. Pour the aquavit on top, cover the dish with plastic wrap, and place a heavy weight, such as two heavy plates or a saucepan, on top of the fish. Refrigerate for 3 to 4 days, turning the fish every 12 hours and basting it with the brine that accumulates in the dish. To serve, dust off some of the spices and slice the fish into thin slices with a sharp thin knife. The flesh from the tail will be leaner than the flesh from the belly. Serve with mustard sauce and dark rye bread, for open-faced sandwiches, or with mustard, pickles, and capers.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindent">Juniper berries, fennel, allspice, and bay leaves are all traditional spices that offer a taste of the wild. On the more experimental side, a smoky barbecue sauce or smoked chipotle chiles will give the impression that the fish has been smoked as well.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Even if you do not cure your own gravlaks, the commercially cured fish you buy could benefit from a little bit of spicing up. You could simply pour a mixture of aquavit and crushed juniper berries over the fish, and give it an extra night in your own fridge before serving. The gravlaks will keep for 1 week.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Serve with Sweet Mustard Sauce (<a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_39">page 39</a>) and New Potato Salad with Herbs and Green Beans (<a class="nounder" href="ch03.html#page_77">page 77</a>) or Green Beans and Peas with Celeriac and Mango (<a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#page_230">page 230</a>) and bread.</p>

<p class="image"><a id="page_42"/><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig04.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Today wild Atlantic salmon is considered one of the finest things you can eat, both expensive and hard to get. It has not always been like that. A few hundred years ago, salmon was the staple food of the poor and was held in low regard. In fact, lumbermen in Sweden and Norway often had clauses in their work contracts guaranteeing that they would not be served salmon more than five days a week. In Sweden’s northernmost regions, money was scarce but salmon was plentiful, and as late as the seventeenth century taxes were still paid in the form of salmon.</p>
<p class="indent">For centuries, the salmon lived a double life. While in Scandinavia it was looked down upon as the simplest of all food, throughout the rest of Europe there was a salmon craze. British, French, and German aristocrats were willing to pay exorbitant sums for the fish that the bourgeoisie of the north would not touch. In France, smoked salmon from Sweden was twenty times more expensive than the finest cuts of veal or venison. And gradually Norway and Sweden became chic holiday spots for wildlife-hungry Europeans, an angler’s paradise. Most Norwegians shook their heads in disbelief when they learned that British lords and Prussian businessmen were paying money to come to visit Norwegian rivers and fish their national fish.</p>

</div>
<p class="noindents">SERVES 4 AS AN APPETIZER</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup crème fraîche or sour cream</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>16 raspberries</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons Raspberry Vinegar (<a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#ch02_rec2">recipe follows</a>) or white wine vinegar, or more to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 to 2 teaspoons sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ pound spinach leaves, tough stems removed, thoroughly washed and patted dry</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 to 12 thin slices smoked salmon</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Pink peppercorns for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Preheat the broiler.</p>
<p class="noindentt">To prepare the dressing, combine the crème fraîche, half the raspberries, the vinegar, and sugar in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper. The dressing should be pleasantly tart.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Spread the spinach leaves on four ovenproof dinner plates. Sprinkle lightly with olive oil. Place the spinach under the broiler for 1 to 2 minutes, until the leaves have started to wilt. The spinach should not burn; however, don’t worry if there are a few black patches on some of the spinach leaves—that just adds to the smoky flavor. Let the plates cool for 3 to 4 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Place the smoked salmon on top of the spinach, drizzle with stripes of the dressing, and garnish with the remaining 8 raspberries. Sprinkle with whole or crushed pink peppercorns.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="ch02_rec2"/>Raspberry Vinegar</h4>
<p class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig05a.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindents">MAKES 2 CUPS</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>20 raspberries, plus a few for garnish (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 cups white wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Place the raspberries in a lidded jar or a bottle and pour in the vinegar. Let stand in a warm place, such as the window sill or next to the oven, for 2 to 3 days; shake the jar gently once a day.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Strain the vinegar and pour it back into the bottle. You might want to add a few fresh berries for decorative purposes, but they soon turn pale. It will keep, refrigerated, for up to 1 month.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindent">The sweet tartness of raspberry vinegar makes it quite versatile, and it works well not only in dressings, but also in a wide variety of sweet and savory dishes. Sprinkle a few drops over fresh strawberries, or add a teaspoon or two to a hollandaise to go with fish. Although raspberry vinegar can be bought in most supermarkets, the best—and easiest—thing is to make your own.</p>

<p class="uln"><strong>6 tablespoons salmon roe</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Small sprigs of fresh dill for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">To cook the asparagus, bring 4 cups salted water to a boil in a wide saucepan. Squeeze the lemon juice into the pot, then add the rind to the water (the lemon prevents the asparagus from discoloring during cooking). Add the asparagus and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until tender but still firm in the center. Drain the asparagus and rinse under cold water to prevent further cooking.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Spread the salmon mousse on the potato cakes. (If you are using smoked salmon and sour cream, spread the sour cream on the potato cakes, then place the smoked salmon on top.) Place an asparagus spear on each cake and roll the cakes up around the asparagus. With a very sharp thin knife, cut each potato cake into 4 or 6 slices and arrange them on a serving plate cut side up. Add a little spoonful of salmon roe and a small sprig of dill to each canapé.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindent">There is almost no limit to what you can match with a potato cake—in Norway, hot dogs are typically served wrapped in potato cakes instead of in rolls. For snacks, or with coffee, they may be served with sweet goat cheese, syrup, or honey.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Potato cakes can be bought in specialty shops or through the mail (see <a class="nounder" href="source.html#page_294">Mail-Order Sources</a>).</p>
