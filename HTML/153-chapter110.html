<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">In the Spanish kitchen, chicken and dried fruits are natural and frequent partners. And while prunes and apricots are often stuffed <em>inside</em> the birds (along with, not uncommonly, fresh sausage), they also go well <em>alongside</em> the bird in a roasting pan. This dish makes a simple, delicious Sunday lunch. I like to soak the prunes in wine before adding. Sometimes I take a few apricots from my jar of them macerating in muscatel <a href="228-chapter166.html#page_326"><span class="red">(see page 326)</span></a> and add along with the prunes. Delightful.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 CUP/160 G PITTED PRUNES</li>
<li>½&gt; CUP/120 ML DRY WHITE WINE</li>
<li>1 WHOLE CLEANED CHICKEN, ABOUT 4 POUNDS/1.8 KG</li>
<li>3 TABLESPOONS EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL</li>
<li>SALT AND FRESHLY GROUND BLACK PEPPER</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Place the prunes in a bowl and cover with the wine.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> Preheat the oven to 400°F/200°C/gas mark 6.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Rinse the chicken on the inside as well the outside. Pat dry with paper towels.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> In a roasting pan, place the chicken breast-side down. Lightly rub with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast it until golden, about 25 minutes, and then turn the chicken breast-side up. Drain the prunes, reserving the wine. Arrange the prunes around the chicken and drizzle the wine over the top. Dribble in ½&gt; cup/120 ml water around the base. Reduce the heat to 350°F/180°C/gas mark 4 and continue to roast until the chicken is golden and an instant-read thermometer probed in the thigh reads at least 165°F/74°C, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes before carving.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Arrange the chicken on a serving platter and surround it with prunes. Ladle the sauce around the sides and serve.</p>
