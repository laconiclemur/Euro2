<p class="noindentb">This recipe, created by my mother, is a good example of how she and I typically cook. She had some chicken wings and no recipe to follow. So she began to mix a little of this and a little of that—garlic, olive oil, rosemary. “At the last moment I decided to add some wine and tomato sauce,” says Joan. “I have since tried this recipe without the sauce and the dish was not as good.”</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">16 chicken wings, rinsed, patted dry, and wing tips removed</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 tablespoons olive oil</span></p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Split the wings into two pieces at the joint. Place the split wings in a roasting or baking dish large enough to hold them in a single layer. Drizzle the olive oil on top and season with salt and pepper. Add the garlic, shallot, onion, rosemary, sage, thyme, and oregano, and toss to coat evenly. Bake, stirring once or twice, until lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Stir in the wine and bake for about 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Stir in the tomato sauce and bake, stirring once or twice, until the wings are browned and cooked through, about another 10 minutes. Serve immediately.</p>
