<p class="noindenti"><span class="stickup">T</span>he Italian futurists believed in the abolition of pasta because they said it “slowed down” the Italian people. They believed in a diet consisting mostly of meat. Some of their bizarre recipes called for a variety of meats cooked and served together. They felt this high-protein diet would propel them to be more aggressive and therefore successful in every way. Fortunately, while the futurists’ art had great impact culturally, their dietary regimen did not. What would Italian cuisine be without the tradition of lingering over multiple, perfectly proportioned courses?</p>
<p class="indenti">One of the distinguishing features of dining around an Italian table is the pacing of the meal. Beginning with a pasta dish, the meat course follows—the portion only large enough to satisfy, complementing what came before but saving room for the following course. This is one of the reasons Italians live long and healthy lives. That and the daily consumption of red wine.</p>
