  <h2 class="section sgc-1" id="heading_id_2"><a id="page134"></a>THE BAKED TROUT STUFFED WITH SORREL</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Whiting, small sea bass, or any white-fleshed, non-fatty fish of the right size to serve as an individual portion may be prepared in this way. The relative firmness of the trout’s flesh lends itself particularly well to this preparation. The fragility of the whiting, once cooked, renders the service difficult. A bed of stewed sorrel laid with fish fillets, masked with <em>béchamel</em>, sprinkled with cheese, dotted with butter and gratinéed is another happy possibility.</p>

  <p class="indent">A Mousseline Forcemeat of the same or another fish (<a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#rh14">this page</a>) or a tomatoed <em><a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#rh6">Duxelles</a></em> are other stuffing possibilities for fish boned and baked in this way. The final addition of cream is, in these instances, unnecessary.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c03-s11"><em><span class="color">Baked Trout Stuffed with Sorrel</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Truites à l’Oseille au Four</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 medium-size trout</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pound sorrel</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ pound butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 small onion, finely chopped</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ cup dry white wine</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>buttered kitchen paper cut slightly smaller than top of baking dish</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ cup heavy cream</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Using a small, sharp pointed knife, slit each trout the length of the back on each side of the spinal column in order cleanly to separate the fillets from the central skeletal structure, taking care not to puncture the skin of the belly. Clip the spinal column at the base of the head and about an inch from the tail, remove it, empty the fish and tear out the gills. Rinse fish inside and out and sponge dry with paper towels.</p>

  <p class="indent">Pull the stems backward from the sorrel leaves and detach them, pulling with them any fibrous veins from the leaves. Wash the leaves <a id="page135"></a>in several waters, drain them, shred them coarsely on the chopping board and stew them gently in half the butter, seasoned with salt and pepper, stirring frequently, until they have “melted” to a near purée.</p>

  <p class="indent">Spread onions over the bottom of an earthenware or enameled cast-iron baking or gratin dish just large enough to hold the fish comfortably. Season them, inside and out, and arrange them in the dish, belly down. Place a small piece of butter inside each and stuff the cavities with the sorrel purée. Place a thin slice of butter on top of each, sprinkle white wine over and around the fish, gently press the buttered paper on the surface and bake in a hot oven (about 400° F.) for about 15 minutes. Upon removing them from the oven, pour a tablespoon of heavy cream over each and serve immediately in their baking dish.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_3">THE SAUTEED VEAL KIDNEYS WITH MUSHROOMS</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Calves’ kidneys are less strong in flavor than others and most recipes do not recommend discarding the liquid that is drained from them after the initial cooking. It is, however, this liquid that contains the flavor that many people fear. Prepared in the following manner, kidneys rarely fail to please the wariest of guests.</p>

  <p class="indent">The following is a recipe “type,” and is among the simplest of ways to prepare sautéed kidneys. The many variations depend on different garnishing and flavoring elements, but the process remains identical. In professional kitchens meat glaze usually lends additional body and intensity to the sauce.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c03-s12"><em><span class="color">Sautéed Veal Kidneys with Mushrooms</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Rognons de Veau Sautés aux Champignons</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 fresh (not frozen) veal kidneys</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 tablespoons (2 ounces) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><a id="page136"></a><em>salt and pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ pound mushrooms, cleaned and thickly sliced</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 gray shallots (or one small onion) finely chopped</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 tablespoons cognac</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>⅓ cup dry white wine</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup heavy cream</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Remove the fat and fine surface membrane from the kidneys and cut each symmetrically in two lengthwise. Remove the core of fat and cut each section crosswise into approximately ½-inch slices.</p>

  <p class="indent">Heat the butter in a heavy skillet or <em>sauteuse</em> (avoid enamelware), add the kidneys, salt and freshly ground pepper, and cook over a high flame, tossing or stirring regularly with a wooden spoon for 2 or 3 minutes, until they turn grayish in color and are firm and somewhat “rubbery” to the touch—no more; they must remain pink inside. Remove them immediately to a strainer or colander, leaving their cooking butter in the <em>sauteuse</em>, and allow them to drain while finishing the sauce. The brief contact with heat will cause them to “bleed” and this liquid should be discarded.</p>

  <p class="indent">Season and toss the mushrooms in the same butter, still over a high flame, for a couple of minutes, or until their natural liquid has evaporated and they are slightly browned. Remove them and replace them by the chopped shallots or onion. Stir them around for a few seconds, add the cognac and the wine and reduce almost completely, stirring and scraping with a wooden spoon to loosen and dissolve all adhering frying matter; then return the mushrooms to the pan and add ½ cup of cream. Reduce, stirring constantly, until the sauce becomes fairly thick, adding a bit more cream if it seems too sparse. Lower the flame and return the kidneys to the sauce, stirring them around for a few seconds to ensure their being thoroughly reheated in the sauce, but under no circumstances allow the sauce to boil again, as this would toughen the kidneys. Remove from the flame, stir in enough additional cream to bring the sauce back to a very lightly thickened consistency. Taste for seasoning and serve at once, accompanied by a <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#rh3">Pilaf</a>.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c03-s13"><a id="page137"></a><em><span class="color">Lamb’s Lettuce and Beet Salad</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Salade de Mâche et Betteraves</p>

  <p class="nonindent">Lamb’s lettuce is found at Italian greengrocers in large cities. It is easy to raise and, in temperate climates, may be picked all winter long.</p>

  <p class="indent">Bake the beets in the oven (the French more often simply boil them, but they are far better baked, and better still cooked under hot ashes) and, when they are cooled, peel them and cut them into thin slices, large dice, or coarse julienne sticks. They should be allowed to macerate for an hour or two before being served and the vinaigrette should, because of the natural sweetness of the beets, be somewhat more salty than usual. The lamb’s lettuce requires a very thorough washing and should be carefully dried by being pressed between two towels. It should be tossed with the beets only at the moment of serving.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_4">THE CHARLOTTE WITH CREPES</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">“Charlotte” refers only to the mold, and any number of otherwise unrelated desserts formed in this mold, some cooked, others merely chilled in it, may take the name. Non-dessert preparations are, however, never called charlottes. This dessert is a simplified variation of pudding Bohémienne.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c03-s14"><em><span class="color">Charlotte with Crêpes, Sabayon Sauce</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Charlotte aux Crêpes, Sauce Sabayon</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon (½ ounce) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>9 dessert <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#crpes">Crêpes</a></em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>jam or jelly, such as apricot, currant, black currant</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><a id="page138"></a><em>Custard mixture:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>just under ½ cup sugar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2¾ cups milk</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>strip of lemon peel</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tiny pinch salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 whole eggs</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 egg yolks</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em><a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c03_r1.htm#rh11">Sabayon Sauce</a></em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">A standard charlotte mold accommodates approximately 3 pints of liquid and measures about 5 inches in diameter at the bottom. The crêpes should be prepared in a small crêpe pan whose bottom diameter is also 5 inches.</p>

  <p class="indent">Butter the mold generously and line the bottom with a crêpe, pressing it to ensure its adhering. Spread the other crêpes, almost to their edges, with the chosen jam or jelly and fold them, top down, bottom up, and each side inward, in the form of rectangles whose height (slightly over 3 inches) corresponds to that of the mold. Some should be folded slightly wider at the top than at the bottom to compensate for the spread at the top of the mold. Press each gently with the palm of the hand to ensure its holding its shape, then press them side by side against the wall of the mold, folded sides facing in. While preparing the custard, chill the mold in the refrigerator in order to strengthen the adherence of the crêpes.</p>

  <p class="indent">For the custard, combine the sugar, milk, and lemon peel in a sauce-pan, and bring to a boil. Remove from heat, leave to infuse for 15 minutes, and discard the lemon peel. Beat the eggs and extra egg yolks together in a large bowl as for an omelet, add salt, then pour in the milk mixture, whisking as you pour. Pass the mixture through a fine drum sieve into another mixing bowl, leave to stand a minute or so, and carefully skim the foam from the surface. Pour the custard into the mold slowly, so as not to displace the crêpes, and place the mold in a <em>bain-marie</em>—a larger receptacle into which enough nearly boiling water is poured to immerse the mold by two-thirds. Cook in a slow oven for approximately 40 minutes, taking care that the water never reaches a boil. The pudding is done when the center of the cream is firm to the touch (or when a needle or small pointed knife, plunged into the center, comes out clean).</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page139"></a>Leave it to cool, and unmold it while still slightly tepid. (If left to chill in the mold, the hardened butter will resist unmolding.) The mold should, however, be left over the unmolded pudding to act as a cover and protect it from the air until the moment of serving. Serve well chilled, masked by several spoonfuls of chilled <em>sabayon</em> sauce, the rest served separately in a sauceboat.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="rh11">THE SABAYON SAUCE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">The principle is the same as the rich, heady Italian <em>zabaglione</em>, but, with a light white wine replacing the Marsala, a <em>sabayon</em> finds a far wider range of application. It may also be prepared with champagne, Sauternes, etc., but, if a particularly fine wine is used, it would be an error to add an additional flavor such as lemon or vanilla. With a hot dessert, <em>sabayon</em> should be prepared at the last minute and served hot. The flavor of a cold <em>sabayon</em> may be attenuated by the addition of a certain amount of whipped cream, if one likes.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="heading_id_5"><em><span class="color">Sabayon Sauce</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Sauce Sabayon</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ cup sugar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 egg yolks</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>⅔ cup dry white wine</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 strips of lemon peel (peeled thin to avoid the white), then cut crosswise into tiny threadlike julienne strips</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Beat the sugar and egg yolks together in a saucepan (the sauce doubles in quantity, so choose the saucepan accordingly) until creamy. Add the white wine and the julienne of lemon peel and whisk in a <em>bain-marie</em> (in this case, the saucepan is immersed in a larger saucepan of nearly boiling water on top of the stove) over a low flame until thickened. The water should be kept near the boiling point, but should not boil. Lower the flame, if necessary, or raise it if the process seems to take too long.</p>
