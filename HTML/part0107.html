<h2 class="rec_heading" id="sab0000055"><a id="pg146" class="pcalibre calibre8"></a>SQUID <em class="calibre12">ENCEBOLLADO</em></h2>
<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0000056">This is a classic Basque dish and one of my favourites – I always order it as a starter. It can also be made with tuna, cut into cubes and fried very quickly.</p>
<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0000057"><em class="calibre9">Encebollado</em> means ‘cooked with onions’: we love to caramelize onions in Spain, and the only thing you need to do it well is time.</p>
<aside class="sidebar_wrapper">
<h5 class="serves">FOR 4</h5>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000058">75ml extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000059">2 large onions, julienned</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000060">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000061">2 bay leaves</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000062">100ml white wine</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000064">500ml prawn stock (see <a href="part0218.html#pg288" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>)</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000065">800g squid, including tentacles (ask your fishmonger to clean them for you), bodies scored in diamonds</p>
<p class="ingredients_first_line" id="sab0000066">3 tablespoons chopped fresh chives</p>
</aside>
<div class="maincontent_wrapper">
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000067">Put 25ml of olive oil into a large pan on a medium heat. Add the onions, a pinch of salt (this helps the onions to lose water and therefore cook more quickly) and the bay leaves. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are about three-quarters of the way to being caramelized: they should be light golden brown but translucent. The time the onions take to cook will depend on the size of the pan used.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000068">Add the wine and cook to evaporate the alcohol, then add the stock and reduce by about half, just so everything comes together – you’re looking for a nice sauce-y spoonful.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000069">Put the remaining 50ml of olive oil into another pan on a medium-high heat, and add the squid. Season with salt and pepper, and cook for 1–1½ minutes on each side – the tentacles might only need a minute.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0000070">Remove the squid to a chopping board and cut into three or four 2–3cm rings. Add to the pan of caramelized onions, mixing together, and cook for a couple of minutes more on a very low heat, just to bring it together. Finish with chopped chives, and serve.</p>
