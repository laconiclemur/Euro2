<p class="h1"><a id="page_13"/><a id="ch02"/><span class="blue">Appetizers</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Appetizers, when shared with friends or family, bring relaxation and enjoyment. They afford people an opportunity to unwind before the main meal, and show a caring host or hostess. In lives crowded with responsibilities appetizers enhance the dinner hour and the time allocated for enjoyment. They do not require an immense effort of time, or means, only a little creativity.</p>
<p class="indent">There are numerous foods you can attach to toothpicks by themselves or in combinations and position into fruits or vegetables. You can use a combination of ingredients, for example Jarlsberg cheese and radishes, cocktail sausages broiled with a piece of bacon, or olives and cheese. Or thread separately, fresh small mushrooms, green or black olives, small pickles, berries, or bits of fruit on to the toothpick. Attach all of one kind into a fruit or intermingle them so as to form a colorful pattern.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Walnuts and Cheese<br/>(Valnøtter og ost)</span></p>
<p class="noindent8"><i>Walnuts taste excellent with cheese. Normanna or Roquefort have a piquant taste, try mixing them with a little cream or butter. Or use cream cheese mixed with crushed, well-drained pineapple.</i></p>
<p class="noindent4">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">Walnut halves</p>
<p class="noindent6">Butter or light cream</p>
<p class="noindent6">Normanna cheese (Norwegian Roquefort)</p>
<p class="noindent6">Green grapes</p>
<p class="noindent2">Rub cheese through a sieve, or mash with a fork, and blend with a little butter (room temperature) or cream. Place a small amount of cheese on whole walnut halves, press a grape into the cheese on one half, and top with the other half. Attach a toothpick into the center and place into desired fruit. To give added color, place fruit on a bed of curly endive.</p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg13_01.png"/></p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Meatball Snacks<br/>(kjøttkakepinnemat)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">Make bite-size Norwegian meatballs. Attach to a toothpick. Add a small piece of marinaded, welldrained cucumber or a small piece of Boston lettuce (for marinade see Cucumber salad p. 30). Place into desired vegetable.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Cheese Trays (Ostebretter)</span></p>
<p class="noindent5"><i>Make some great cheese platters with fruit for an evening snack, a light supper, or desserts after a light buffet or dinner.</i></p>
<p class="noindent2">Serve cheese with <i>kjeks</i>, a dry cookie-like cracker, hardtack, or any kind of bread that does not clash with the cheese flavors. Vegetables such as celery, radishes, tomatoes, or cucumbers taste delicious with cheese. Or add fruit such as sliced apples, oranges or tangerine wedges, kiwi fruit, pears, or grapes. If you use apple slices or bananas, use a little lemon juice to prevent the fruit from darkening.</p>
<p class="indent">You need a minimum of two to three different kinds of cheese for just two people or for several people you might want up to five or six different kinds of cheese (for example, Ridder, Brie, Jarlsberg, Norzola, and a typical dessert cheese like Ridder). And among Norwegian-Americans, no matter what the occasion, there will be someone on the lookout for brown, sweet goat cheese. Choose cheese with different flavors and textures, something for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<p class="indent">Some soft cheeses come in their own little containers and look best in these. Place them directly on the  <a id="page_14"/>cheese tray. The hard cheese may be left in a whole piece or partly pre-sliced. Cut into logs and stack crisscross, or cube some of the cheeses and place in small clear glass bowls with toothpicks nearby.</p>
<p class="indent">When arranging a tray, take color and flavor into consideration. Strategically place the fruit or vegetables to be used in between the cheeses. Depending on the size of your platter you may add crackers, hardtack, or bread sticks directly to the platter. If you have several types place them on a separate platter or in a breadbasket with a colorful doily.</p>

<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Marinated Edam Cheese<br/>(Marinért edamerost)</span></p>
<p class="noinden7"><i>I shall always be appreciative to Anna-Karin Lindstad of Tine for sharing this recipe with me. It is a marvelous delicacy to give as a gift at Christmas, serve guests, or when you yearn for a little </i>godbit<i> for yourself. Serve with crackers or dark bread.</i></p>
<p class="noindent5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">11 oz. (300 g.) scant Edam cheese</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 tbsp. oregano</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 red paprika, cut in strips</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 tbsp. thyme</p>
<p class="noindent6">1¼ cups (3 dl) olive oil</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 garlic cloves</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 tbsp. green peppercorns</p>
<p class="noindent6">7/8 cup (2 dl) white vinegar</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 tbsp. red pepper, finely chopped</p>
<p class="noindent2">Dice cheese the size of sugar cubes. Prick with a fork to allow the marinade to be absorbed. Mix all ingredients for marinade in a heavy-bottomed casserole and bring to a boil. Cool. Layer cheese and paprika in a jar and pour marinade over all. Cover and chill. Keeps 2–3 weeks in the refrigerator. Let the cheese come to room temperature before serving, allowing it to come into full flavor.</p>

<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Ridder Appetizer<br/>(Ridder appetittvekker)</span></p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg14_04.png"/></p>
<p class="noindent">A beautiful, tasty, nutritious, and simple appetizer made with Ridder ost, the distinctive dessert cheese.</p>
<p class="noindent5"><i> <a id="page_15"/></i>Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">Ridder cheese</p>
<p class="noindent6">Lemon juice</p>
<p class="noindent6">Mint leaves</p>
<p class="noindent6">Honeydew melon, ripe</p>
<p class="noindent6">Strawberries</p>
<p class="noindent1">Cut a long strip of Ridder cheese with a cheese slicer while cheese is still chilled. Fold it up like a rose. Slice 5 small wedges of honeydew melon, about 1-inch (2 ½-cm) thick, and cut in half. Sprinkle with lemon juice and place like a pin wheel on a clear glass plate. Place your cheese flower in the center and garnish with mint leaves and strawberries.</p>
<p class="h1b"><span class="red">Open-Face Sandwich Tidbits<br/>(Appetittbiter)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">A tray of bite-size sandwiches will get any meal off to a good start. They should be made just before your guests arrive so they will be fresh, crip, and tasy. Use firm bread and cut out desired shapes, rectangles, rounds, diamonds, and so on. Because they are small, use toothpicks to hold the toppings in place. Any of the sandwich fillings printed in this book can be used, but in bite-size portions. Decorate with cocktail onions, small olives, slices of cucumbers, cocktail tomato wedges, chopped green onions, chives, paseley, and dill sprigs. Whichever combination you choose, make it colorful. And always top bread with a small piece of crisp lettuce before adding sandwich ingredients. Display your appetizers on a serving platter covered with an attractive doily. Figure on 3 to 4 cocktail sandwiches per person. Here are a few samples:</p>
<p class="noindent3"><b>Brie (<i>Brie</i>):</b> Add a small pie-shaped piece with grapes or walnut half.</p>
<p class="noindent3"><b>Cucumber (<i>Slangeagurk</i>): </b>Slice thin, top with fresh small shrimp, a wedge of liver pate with a piece of tomato, or shellfish salad. Garnish.</p>
<p class="noindent3"><b>Edam cheese (<i>Edamerost</i>): </b>Add sliced olives or radishes.</p>
<p class="noindent3"><b>Eggs (<i>Egg</i>): </b>To hard boiled egg slices, add lox rolled in chopped chives and fastened with a toothpick, or use anchovies and some dill.</p>
<p class="noindent3"><b>Eggs, scrambled (<i>Eggrøre</i>): </b>Add ham and chives or bacon and tomato.</p>
<p class="noindent3"><b>Roquefort cheese (<i>Roquefort</i>): </b>Add small seedless grape clusters, or fresh cherries with the stem.</p>
<p class="noindent3"><b>Salami (<i>Salamipølse</i>): </b>Fold a slice of salami and hold together with two cocktail onions speared on a toothpick.</p>
<p class="noindent3"><b>Sardines in tomato sauce: </b>Need nothing additional but a piece of Boston lettuce tucked under one corner.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Sardine Spread (Sardinpålegg)</span></p>

<p class="h1"><a id="ch03"/><span class="blue">Open-Face Sandwiches<br/>(Smørbrød)</span></p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg15_01.png"/></p>
<p class="indent">Few foods are as adaptable to one’s various moods or time of day as open-face sandwiches. They are nourishing and inviting, and quickly and easily prepared for drop-in guests. They are just as suitable for a luncheon as for a light supper or an evening snack. 
<a id="page_16"/>The latter is traditionally enjoyed accompanied by a hot cup of coffee, cocoa, a cake, or cookies. You can serve bite-size sandwiches as appetizers, or fruit sandwiches as a special treat, or salad sandwiches and hot scrumptious sandwiches as a whole meal. <i>Smørbrød</i>, literally translated, means buttered bread. The bread must be of firm consistency and thinly sliced. <i>Smørbrød</i> are served in Norwegian restaurants in a staggering variety and even the most experienced <i>smørbrød</i> fan, at times, must take a moment to meditate before making a choice. Daily, families leave for school or work with their lunch boxes packed with their favorite <i>smørbrød</i>, or with a surprise creation.</p>
<p class="indent">Though, like in America, regrettably, more people are finding “fast foods” becoming a part of their daily routine. When Norwegians <i>drar på tur</i>, go on picnics to the woods or mountains, or <i>drar på stranda</i>, go to the beach, a tasty variety of <i>smørbrød</i>, carefully packed, is usually included.</p>
<p class="indentb">Certain rules must be followed to insure success of this delicacy:</p>
<p class="hangg"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg16_01.png"/>   
<b>Organize. This will ensure the enjoyment of the entire project.</b></p>
<p class="hangg"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg16_01.png"/>   <b>Prepare a working area large enough to accommodate all necessary ingredients that have been assembled in advance.</b></p>
<p class="hangg"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg16_01.png"/>   <b>Use soft flavored or unflavored butter. Arrange the bread slices in a row on a work area and butter all bread at once, unless you are preparing a tremendous amount.</b></p>
<p class="hangg"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg16_01.png"/>   <b>Spread entire surface of each slice to the very edges.</b></p>
<p class="hangg"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg16_01.png"/>   <b>Keep in mind that the sandwich filling and the tidbits used for decoration should complement each other. Just as important as taste is the chosen color combination. Open-face sandwiches should tempt the eye as well as please the palate.</b></p>
<p class="hangg"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg16_01.png"/>   <b>When the <i>smørbrød </i>are completed, arrange them attractively on a large platter, making sure colors blend for maximum eye appeal. Cover immediately with plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out or flavor from escaping.</b></p>
<p class="hangg"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg16_01.png"/>   <b>There are numerous varieties of bread, and choosing the right one is important. Rye and pumpernickel are widely used as they are moist yet firm in texture. Another good choice is hardtack, available in light, dark, or rye. Keep in mind that the flavor of the bread should blend with the sandwich toppings. Bread should be thinly sliced about 1/8-inch (3-mm) thickness. Whichever type of bread is chosen, light or dark, it should be firm.</b></p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Sandwiches with Shellfish<br/>(Smørbrød med skalldyr) </span> </p>
<p class="noindent4"><i>Lobster or crab sandwiches may be prepared in the same manner.</i></p>
<p class="noindent">A discriminating guest will be pleased when served lobster, crab, or shrimp sandwiches. These sandwiches are more expensive than other types but worth it! Mayonnaise can be blended with the shellfish or added decoratively from a tube after the fish has been arranged on the bread. The use of mayonnaise is optional. Just a dab of mayonnaise topped with a lemon slice or wedge will suffice. Be generous with the filling. Use 3–4 ounces (85–115 grams) depending on the size of the bread slice. When prepared thoughtfully, these sandwiches will serve as a complete meal. Any firm bread will do, white or whole grain.</p>

<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Italian Salad (Italiensk salat)</span></p>
<p class="noindent4"><i>The origin and name of this salad is a mystery, since cabbage is a staple food and has been served continually for generations. Maybe it was a fancy name to add some excitement to dark, cold winter days. Nonetheless, it is as much a part of Norwegian food fare as sardines. It can be served on sandwiches or as a salad in a bowl.</i></p>

<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg19_01.png"/></p>
<p class="noindent2">Egg sandwiches with a variety of accompaniments are ever popular in Norway. Try some with sliced, hard boiled eggs. Or the many combinations used with scrambled eggs such as sardines in tomato sauce, kippers, ham, gravlaks, smoked eel, and many more.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><b>Egg and tomato:</b> Add lettuce, tomato, parsley, salt, and pepper.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><b>Egg and Anchovies or Herring Tidbits <i>(Gaffelbiter): </i></b>Use Scandinavian anchovies, as those from southern Europe are too salty. Add lettuce, anchovies, or herring tidbits, a sprig of parsley, salt, and pepper.</p>

Pour egg mixture into hot pan, and over low heat, allow to congeal slightly. Then stir carefully making sure the eggs do not brown. But do not stir too much—the eggs should be firm and lumpy, but not dry. Place the eggs on bread and add the crisp bacon. Tuck a lettuce leaf under the eggs in one corner. Sprinkle with more chives if desired, and add tomato wedges.</p>
<p class="h1b"><span class="red">Smoked Eel (Røketå °l)</span></p>
<p class="noindent2">Smoked eel is another delicacy with such a distinct, pleasing flavor that it is best to keep the sandwiches simple. Leave plain with just a touch of real mayonnaise, a lemon slice, and paprika, or add a spoonful of scrambled eggs.</p>
