<p class="author1"><span class="txit">lasagne di pollo e funghi misti</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">This lasagna recipe may be served as a pasta course before roasted pork or grilled fish. When served with bread and a tossed green salad, it makes a meal all by itself. It may be baked up to one day in advance. Cover it and refrigerate overnight, then allow to return to room temperature before reheating. It also freezes well.</p>
<p class="noindentq"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE CHICKEN</span>:</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 whole boneless, skinless chicken breast, split</span></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 teaspoons butter</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 teaspoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 fresh sage leaves</span></p>
<p class="noindentq"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE WHITE SAUCE</span>:</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 tablespoons (<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> stick) butter</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup all-purpose flour</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 cups whole milk, at room temperature</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Pinch of ground nutmeg</span></p>
<p class="noindentq"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE LASAGNA</span>:</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">12 strips lasagna pasta, dried or fresh, cooked al dente and rinsed in cold water</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 recipe <a class="nounder" href="ach65.html#page_129">Tomato Sauce with Mushrooms</a></span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">3</sub> cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="noindentq"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">TO PREPARE THE CHICKEN:</span></span></p>
<p class="noindentqa">The chicken breast should be about <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> inch thick. If necessary, place it between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound to achieve the desired thickness. Season the chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Heat the butter and oil in a medium sauté pan set over medium heat. When the butter is foaming, add the sage and then place the chicken in the pan. Cook over medium heat so the chicken slowly browns on one side, about 5 minutes. Turn and continue cooking until browned and cooked through, about 5 more minutes. Remove from the pan and allow to cool. Dice into <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>-inch cubes (there should be about 1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cups).</p>
<p class="noindentq"><a id="page_163"/><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">TO PREPARE THE WHITE SAUCE</span>:</span></p>
<p class="noindentqa">Melt the butter in a 2-quart saucepan set over medium-high heat. When the butter is foaming, whisk in the flour. Gradually whisk in the milk and nutmeg. Reduce the heat to medium and continue whisking until the sauce thickens, about 8 minutes. (If you plan to bake the lasagna a day before serving, or if you plan to freeze it, the sauce may be of slightly thinner consistency because it will thicken as it cools. To make a thinner sauce, cook for less time.) Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
