<h2 class="h2b">SARDINES FARCIES AUX BLETTES</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Sardines with Swiss Chard</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>I first encountered this combination at a tiny restaurant in Cogolin. It has only six tables and is run by a charming husband and wife, with a hard-working dishwasher the only member of staff. There are three or four choices for each course, always totally seasonal, perfectly seasoned and delicious, and these are changed daily according to the movement of the markets. This dish is a regular feature</em>.</p>
<div class="hang">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
12 very fresh sardines<br/>
1 small head of Swiss chard, about 250g (9oz)<br/>
6 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped<br/>
1 small onion, peeled and finely chopped<br/>
2 large sprigs of fresh thyme, leaves picked from the stalks<br/>
120ml (4fl oz) olive oil<br/>
50g (1¾oz) coarse breadcrumbs<br/>
50g (1¾oz) pine nuts<br/>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>
Vegetable oil for greasing<br/>
2 lemons</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your oven to 200°C/400°F/Gas 6.</p>
<p class="normala">Prepare the sardines as <a href="chapter_002a.html#page41">here</a>, then pop them in the fridge until you need them. Separate the stalks and leaves of the Swiss chard, then dice the stalks finely or chop them in the food processor. Sweat the diced stalks along with the garlic, chopped onion and thyme for 5 minutes in half the olive oil until they soften, but don’t let them colour. While this is going on, slice the Swiss chard leaves finely. Add them to the pan, and cook over a high heat, stirring all the time for about 5 minutes until the vegetables are totally soft. Remove from the heat, add the breadcrumbs and pine nuts, season well and set aside.</p>
<p class="normala">Lay the sardines flat on a greased baking tray, skin side down. Put a spoonful of the chard mixture on the non-tail end of each, then fold the tail back over. (If you have any mixture left, you can heat it, and serve it on the side.) Season the sardines well and squeeze over the juice of 1 lemon. Bake for about 5 minutes in the preheated oven. While they are cooking mix the juice of the second lemon with the remaining olive oil, season well then spoon over and around the sardines.</p>
