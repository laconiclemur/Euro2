</h1>
<p class="pf">Our flat on Banbury Road in Oxford was about fifteen miles away from the air force base in Upper Heyford where Dick was stationed. Oxford is only about sixty miles from London, so we often took in operas, stage plays, and concerts during the time we lived there. We enjoyed Verdi’s <i>Rigoletto</i>
 and <i>La Traviata,</i>
 and Puccini’s <i>La Bohème,</i>
 among other famous operas.</p>
<p>We drove to London in our little tan Beetle, which Dick had purchased for $950 through the base exchange (the PX). The Beetle was built for the British market, with the driver’s seat on the right side, and we drove on the left side of the road. It petrified me to think of driving on the narrow roads that wound through the countryside, skirting farms, pubs, and little settlements.</p>
<p>One night in the fall of 1956, heading home after a particularly long opera, Dick was having trouble staying awake and I was no help with the driving.</p>
<p>“Peach, talk to me! Keep me awake! Talk about anything, but just start talking!”</p>
<p>So I did. I remembered a few days before that, at the Officers’ Wives Club, the base commander’s wife had held up entry blanks to the Pillsbury Bake-Off. Waving the forms around, she announced, “If you want to win a bunch of money—here are the entry blanks—I’ll put them in the women’s john!” I had forgotten to take one, but was thinking I should enter something.</p>
<p>“What should I enter?” I asked Dick.</p>
<p>“Why not that good bread you’ve been baking?”</p>
<p>“Well,” I said, “I’ve got to do something different with it.”</p>
<p>We discussed the possibilities for a while. I had been lonesome for the kind of dark bread that I loved at home, and the best I could do in England was to make a bread using molasses for darkening, and cornmeal, an ingredient I found in the local market under the name of “maize.” I cooked the cornmeal, darkened it with molasses, and made it into a yeast-raised round loaf.</p>
<p>“What if I made the bread into a great big cheese sandwich?” I wondered. “It could have a layer of cheese through the middle, and we could cut it into wedges like pie—wouldn’t that be great for a picnic?”</p>
<p>We discussed that possibility and agreed that I should make the bread the very next day. Dick agreed to pick up an entry blank the next day, too. (I don’t know how he broke into the women’s john.)</p>
<p>Looking at the entry form, we found to our surprise that the postmark deadline was the next day. I would have to hurry.</p>
<p>The cupboard had just enough ingredients to make the bread once. Expecting a beautiful round loaf with a layer of cheese when I opened the oven door, I found instead that the cheese had melted and oozed out, covering the rack and the bottom of the oven. Disappointment!</p>
<p>As I picked the loaf apart, I discovered a few remnants of the cheese suspended in the golden brown crumbs of the bread. It tasted great!</p>
<p>What to do? I wrote down the recipe, but instead of a thick layer of cheese through the middle of the loaf, I thought it just might work if I cut the cheese into cubes and kneaded them into the dough as I shaped it. But I didn’t have enough ingredients or time to try that option, so I just wrote down the recipe, filled out the entry blank, and got the untested recipe into the base mail just in time to be postmarked by the deadline.</p>
<p>Fast-forward nine months.</p>
<p>Dick was finished with his air force duty and we were temporarily staying in his parents’ home in Warba, Minnesota. It was 1957, and he had accepted a temporary one-year position at our alma mater, the University of Minnesota Duluth, while they searched for another addition to the department. We were waiting to get into a rented apartment near the campus. I was pregnant with our first child.</p>
<p>The phone in Warba rang. The call was for me.</p>
<p>“Congratulations! You are one of the one hundred finalists in the Pillsbury Bake-Off!” the voice said.</p>

<p>I was stunned. “When is the Bake-Off?”</p>
<p>I was told it was being held on October 14 in Los Angeles—the very same day the baby was due. Besides that, my copy of the recipe was packed away in household goods that wouldn’t arrive from England until December. Plus, I never really had made the bread according to the recipe I submitted. When a representative from Pillsbury came to Warba to have me sign the entry papers for the Bake-Off, I surreptitiously copied the recipe over his shoulder.</p>
<p>The news of my being a finalist in the contest hit the local newspapers. I didn’t know what to do. My doctor thought I was crazy even to consider going to Los Angeles in my condition, but letters and phone calls from friends and relatives all encouraged me to <i>go!</i>
 I signed my letter saying I would go “conditions permitting.”</p>
<p>Our daughter, Cathy, was conveniently born on October 1. About a week after I came home from the hospital, I flew to Los Angeles and stayed at the Beverly Hilton. My mother took care of the baby, who wasn’t allowed to fly yet. All the exciting events planned for the one hundred finalists escaped me. I was like a sick cow—brimming with milk, desiring nothing but my new child. I wanted to nurse her like a real mother, but I spent every spare minute in the bathroom with a breast pump.</p>
<p>Our pediatrician back home, the kindly Finnish Dr. Leppo, had encouraged me: “You need to use a breast pump, and you can nurse the baby when you get home.”</p>
<p>Later, someone asked my mother if she had fed the baby with a bottle while I was gone. Her answer, “That was the best I could do!”</p>

<p>At the Beverly Hilton, the excitement was palpable. I was among the hundred women, with recipes in hand, marching into the huge ballroom equipped with one hundred ranges and worktables. The tables were loaded with ingredients enough to make our recipes three times over. I baked my loaves and then they were whisked off to the judges.</p>
<p>We each had our photo taken with the then-host of <i>The General Electric Theater,</i>
 Ronald Reagan. He looked totally bored as he posed and faked a smile, pointing to something “out there.” (This was before he became known as the “Great Communicator.”)</p>
<p>I was excited for the awards banquet because I knew I would be going home the next day. To my utter surprise, Art Linkletter announced the winners. “The five-thousand-dollar Second Grand Prize goes to”— he lifted the dome off my loaf of bread—“Mrs. Richard Ojakangas!” I had won! Even if they hadn’t called <i>my</i>
 name—in those days, women didn’t have first names but were identified by whom they were married to. But I had won! The downside was that I had to stay in Los Angeles an extra day.</p>
<p>People often ask me what I did with the five thousand dollars. I did what women in that day did: it paid for two years of my husband’s education as he went for his master’s degree in geology at the University of Missouri in Columbia.</p>

</p>
<p class="rpf">When I entered this recipe in the Bake-Off competition, I used the name “Cheesy Picnic Bread.” Pillsbury later changed the name to “Chunk o’ Cheese Bread.” Today I use a medium sharp cheddar cheese instead of the processed American cheese I used in the original recipe.</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpilf">1¾ cups water</p>
<p class="rpil">½ cup cornmeal</p>
<p class="rpil">2 teaspoons salt</p>
<p class="rpil">½ cup dark molasses</p>
<p class="rpil">2 tablespoons butter</p>
<p class="rpil">1 package or 1 tablespoon active dry yeast</p>
<p class="rpil">½ cup warm water (105°F to 115°F)</p>
<p class="rpil">4 to 5 cups bread flour</p>
<p class="rpill">1 pound sharp cheddar cheese, cut into ½-inch cubes</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">In a medium saucepan, stir together water, cornmeal, and salt. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring constantly, until thickened. Remove from heat and stir in the molasses and butter. Set aside to cool to room temperature.</p>
<p class="rp">In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water. Let sit until creamy, about ten minutes. Add the cornmeal mixture and 2 cups of the flour; beat well. Add the remaining flour ½ cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. When the dough comes together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. (Today, I’d put it into my heavy-duty mixer with the dough hook in place, and mix for 10 minutes, scraping the sides of the bowl often.) Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.</p>
<p class="rp">Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and flatten. Place ⅓ of the cheese cubes on the flattened dough and fold the dough up to enclose the cubes. Do this twice more, until all of the cheese is incorporated into the dough. You may have to let the dough rest for a few minutes between folding. Divide the dough into two equal pieces and form each piece into a round loaf.</p>
<p class="rp">Place the rounds on lightly greased baking sheets, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise until nearly doubled, about 45 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350°F.</p>
<p class="rp">Bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 55 minutes or until golden brown and the bottom of the loaf sounds hollow when tapped.</p>
<p class="rpy">Makes 2 loaves, about 20 servings</p>
