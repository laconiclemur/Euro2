<p class="summary">Olive oils can be light and delicate, or assertive and strong, and their flavors and aromas simple or complex. (They are experienced both up front and as an aftertaste.) Flavors range from sweet through fruity, nutty, spicy, and peppery to pleasantly bitter and pungent. Fragrance—fruity, floral, nutty, grassy—can be elusive or intense. Oil from olives from the same tree can vary from one harvest to the next. Some harvests produce exceptional oil, some more ordinary ones. Blended oils hardly vary, because producers achieve consistency by adjusting their mixes. They create styles that marry complementary qualities of different oils and follow both local taste and tradition for stronger-tasting oils, and the preferences for lightness and mildness of the consumer countries newly converted to olive oil.</p>
<p class="summary">Oils vary depending on the variety of tree and the soil in which it grows; the weather; when and how the olives are harvested (whether they are picked by hand, or the branches are beaten with poles, or the trees are shaken by machines into inverted umbrellas); how ripe the olives are; how quickly the oil is extracted and by what means; and if the olives are a single variety or a blend. There are more than 260 varieties of olive trees in Spain, including subvarieties that have adapted to different localities or were developed through grafting. Arbequina, Picual, Hojiblanca, Empeltre, and Cornicabra are the most extensively grown for oil. A few, like Manzanilla, are better for table olives than for oil.</p>
<p class="summary">The method of production that is now commonly used, called the continuous method, separates the liquid from the solid paste of the crushed olives, and then the oil from the rest of the liquid, by spinning the paste or liquid at high speed in a drum or centrifuge.</p>
<p class="summary">Extra virgin olive oils with a low acidity are the finest, with the richest flavor and aroma. When a group of us were invited to rate a few by a producer, small navy blue cups with glass covers had been lined up. The dark glass is so that you are not influenced by the color of the oil—color does not indicate quality or always style, and green oils are not better than yellow ones. However, a dark green oil is more generally characteristic of a fruity, bitter, astringent oil produced from green olives that have not reached maturity, and golden-yellow oils are more likely to have been made from sweet ripe black olives late in the season. We were asked to cradle each cup in our hands to warm it before removing the cover and inhaling the aroma of the oil, then to taste it by dipping in a piece of bread. In between tastes, we chewed pieces of apple to clean our palates.</p>
<p class="summary">Olive oils labeled “extra virgin” are produced using only mechanical means and have not undergone any chemical treatment. Oils sold simply as “olive oil” are from second and subsequent extractions, and have been processed chemically and refined to remove their acidity. During the writing of this book, I tasted and brought home some fabulous Spanish extra virgin olive oils. Most memorable were a sweet and fruity Catalan oil made from Arbequina olives and a wonderful Priego de Córdoba from Picudo, Hojiblanca, and Picual olives that had a fruity aroma, a slightly bitter taste, and a piquant aftertaste. An oil I found in Jaén made from Picual and Arbequina olives was strong, fruity, piquant, and slightly bitter. Of the twenty extra virgin olive oils with a DO seal, ten are produced in Andalusia (eighty percent of Spanish olive oil is made in Andalusia), five in Catalonia, and one each in Castile–La Mancha, Extremadura, Valencia, Murcia, and Majorca.</p>
<p class="summary">I asked people in different parts of Spain what oils they used. In Seville, Córdoba, and Jaén, the great producing provinces, they told me they used extra virgin oil for cooking everything, even for deep-frying. Top Spanish chefs do the same thing—except for deep-frying. Most other people said they used refined olive oil, which is cheap and bland, for frying, braising, and stewing and for foods such as sweet biscuits and cakes, where they did not want the strong flavor of an extra virgin. They told me that since high temperatures diminish the flavors and the main healthful qualities of extra virgin oils, there was no point in wasting them for deep-frying. Some people said they used sunflower oil because it is cheaper. Many chefs said that for mayonnaise they used a mix of sunflower oil and extra virgin olive oil because too much extra virgin would overpower the taste. A young scientist at an olive oil conference told me that ninety percent of people in Spain use regular olive oil, not extra virgin, because they are not educated enough about quality—and price is an issue too. But everybody said they used extra virgin oil in dressings or to drizzle over a finished dish—a piece of bread, a vegetable, a fish, a soup, a bean stew. The passion for good-quality olive oil is a recent phenomenon, as new as the great Spanish extra virgins that are now being produced.</p>
