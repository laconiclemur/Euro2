<p class="yield">MAKES 1 ROUND 11-INCH/28-CM CAKE</p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">This is <em>the</em> all-purpose Spanish cake. Moist with a slightly crumbling texture, it is prepared with olive oil instead of butter, and yogurt instead of milk. In fact, most popular written recipes give measurements based on a standard individual yogurt container, as in “1 container of yogurt, 1 yogurt container olive oil, 3 yogurt containers sugar . . .” Instead of dusting with powdered sugar, slather some creamy lemon spread <a href="227-chapter165.html#page_325"><span class="red">(see page 325)</span></a> or a favorite fruit preserve on top.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1½&gt; CUPS/330 G SUGAR</li>
<li>½&gt; CUP/120 ML PLAIN UNSWEETENED YOGURT</li>
<li>3 EGGS</li>
<li>2 CUPS/255 G ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR, PLUS MORE FOR PAN</li>
<li>2 TABLESPOONS BAKING POWDER</li>
<li>½&gt; CUP/120 ML OLIVE OIL</li>
<li>FINE ZEST OF 1 ORGANIC LEMON</li>
<li>BUTTER FOR GREASING PAN</li>

</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C/gas mark 4.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a large bowl, vigorously beat the sugar, yogurt, and eggs with an electric mixer until well combined. Blend the flour and baking powder and gradually add them to the bowl along with the olive oil and lemon zest. Mix until combined but not overly beaten.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Grease an 11-inch/28-cm round or springform cake pan or an 8-inch/20-cm square cake pan with butter and dust with flour; shake the pan and discard the flour that does not stick. Pour the batter into the pan.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Bake until done but still spongy (a toothpick poked into the center will come out clean), 25 to 30 minutes. Do not open the oven during baking. Remove from the oven, let cool, and remove from the pan. Before serving, dust with powdered sugar.</p>
