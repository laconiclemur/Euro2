			<p class="rec-intro">Baking meat in a herby salt crust keeps it beautifully moist and brings a lovely scented flavour to the meat. The crust itself is not eaten.</p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 3–4</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 leg of milk-fed lamb, boned (about 800g boned weight)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">olive oil</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">6 slices of day-old rustic white bread, crusts removed</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">3 sprigs of flatleaf parsley</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">3 sprigs of tarragon</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">flour, for dusting</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 free-range egg</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 free-range egg yolk</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">200ml lamb jus (see <a href="part0010_split_015.html#LAMB-jus" class="calibre4">here</a>)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">50g cold unsalted butter, diced</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">salt</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">black pepper</p>
			<p class="for-the">Salt dough</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">250g fine table salt</p>

			<p class="ing-nu">1kg plain flour</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 free-range egg whites</p>

			<p class="body">To make the salt dough, put all the ingredients in a large bowl and bring them together by hand, then knead the dough for no more than a couple of minutes. Leave it to rest in the fridge for at least 2 hours before using.</p>
			<p class="body">Season the lamb and put it in a roasting pan over a high heat with a little olive oil. When it is golden and sealed all over, remove it from the heat and leave it to cool slightly.</p>
			<p class="body">Put the bread in a food processor with the herbs and whizz to make fine green breadcrumbs. Roll the lamb in the crumbs, pressing them on firmly. </p>
			<p class="body">Preheat the oven to 200°C/Fan 180°C/Gas 6. Dust your work surface very lightly with flour, then roll out the salt dough to a thickness of about 1cm. If the dough cracks or breaks, you should be able to reshape it as it is fairly pliable. Place the lamb on the dough and fold it over to wrap and seal the meat completely. Beat the whole egg and egg yolk together and brush over the dough to glaze and seal the seam. Bake in the oven for 35 minutes.</p>
			<p class="body">Remove the lamb from the oven and leave it to rest for at least 20 minutes. Put the lamb jus into a small pan and boil to reduce by about one-third. Whisk in the butter a little at a time. </p>
			<p class="body">To serve, cut open the crust, remove the meat and carve. Serve with the enriched jus and some vegetables such as baby turnips. </p>
