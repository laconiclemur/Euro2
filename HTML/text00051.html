</h1>
<p class="pf">About 4:00 <span class="sm">A.M.</span>
 one day in late 1969 we got a phone call from Jeno Paulucci. He had the idea of making a franchise out of the Somebody’s House restaurant concept. Of course, he didn’t want to buy the local store, as we had yet to turn a profit. We explained that that was because neither Dick nor I could spend much time at the restaurant.</p>
<p>Our involvement with Somebody’s House for the most part was limited to checking the place first thing on Sunday morning before going to church and refilling supplies that were needed. Saturday nights were always busy, and we often ran out of basics like ground meat, French fries, and lettuce.</p>
<p>The restaurant did not have adequate refrigeration to stock up in preparation for busy weekends, so we were on a first-name basis with the local restaurant supply house and our favorite butcher. Somebody’s House opened at 10:00 <span class="sm">A.M.</span>
 and ran until midnight. We made our own bread that we called “penny loaves”; they were sliced thick to form the base for the burgers and to accompany other items on the menu.</p>

<p>Jeno, of course, couldn’t factor tasks like these into his idea of running a restaurant, but he did want to buy the name and basic idea from us. We haggled back and forth for a few weeks, each of us saying that the other cut a hard deal. In the end, we agreed to 222,222 shares in the new company. To seal the deal, Jeno gave us a check for one dollar and a crisp one-dollar bill. I framed them both.</p>
<p>The check and a buck were to sell him the name and the idea. I was to be a vice president in charge of menu development. But I didn’t hear anything from Jeno and his company after that. A local restaurateur was hired to do what I thought I’d be doing. The prototype restaurant that they built in south Minneapolis failed miserably. They had not followed any of our recommendations, plus the guys Jeno hired bought used equipment at the same price as new, which cost the company dearly. They were $100,000 in debt after the first year. What a flop.</p>
<p>We were paid a penny a share for our stock, which amounted to a check for $2,222.22. So much for that!</p>
<p>I was never much of a businessperson. Nor was Dick, even though he almost graduated with a business degree from UMD before switching his major to geology.</p>
<p>One year, I asked him about his marketing classes—what did he remember from them?</p>
<p>His answer was two words: Adam’s Hats.</p>
