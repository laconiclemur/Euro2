  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">C</span>ookies aren’t exactly a specialty of the Portuguese. The traditional ones tend to be crumbly and plain, more like a dunking biscuit. One day at a dinner party, though, I had a sweet thin cookie with a distinctive snap. I immediately made notes in my ever-present little black book; the only thing is, I never asked the hostess for the recipe. I spent months trying to come up with a cookie that matched hers, and finally I’ve done her proud. But I wanted to ratchet up the recipe, adding two iconic Portuguese ingredients to the mix: olives and lemons.</p>

  <p class="indent">Serve this alone, as a lovely accompaniment to tea, or, my favorite, as a crunchy bite alongside a scoop of vanilla ice cream or lemon sorbet.</p>

The edges will be ragged; that’s how they should be. Repeat with 5 more wafers on the same sheet. Lift off the top sheet and slip the parchment with the cookies onto the baking sheet.</p>

    <p class="textbox_title">COFFEE COUNTRY</p>

    <p class="textbox"><span class="dropcaps">W</span>hen I lived in Portugal, and on my many other trips there, I had chances to sample its unparalleled coffee. The most popular type is the <em>bica,</em> the Lisbon term for a small demitasse cup filled with a hair-raising caffeinated brew similar to espresso. It’s so strong that a friend of mine refers to it as “rocket fuel.” An ultra-powerful hit is called an <em>italiana.</em> Both are usually knocked back in one shot. A small cup with a short pour of milk is called <em>garoto escuro</em>; one with a longer pour of milk, <em>garoto claro</em>. And the bipartisan cup of half-coffee–half-milk is called <em>meia de leite</em>. My preference, though, is a tamer distant cousin, the <em>galão,</em> a tall glass filled with hot milk and just a dash of coffee. <em>Carioca</em> is coffee made with lots of water, and <em>abatanado</em> is made with even more water—both of which the Portuguese are fond of comparing to a cup of American joe.</p>

A small metal spatula, usually heart-shaped, is heated like a branding iron and pressed onto the sugar, scorching it and creating a decorative pattern. Chef Albano Lourenço at Arcadas da Capela in the Hotel Quinta das Lágrimas, in Coimbra, tweaks the dessert by first infusing the custard with rosemary, and then giving it the customary French crème brûlée finish of a crystalline crust of caramelized sugar.</p>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Meanwhile, in a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, or with a handheld mixer in a large bowl, whirl the 1 cup of sugar, the cornstarch, and salt together on low speed.

Immediately remove from the heat and divide it among the bowls. Cool for 20 minutes, then chill until set, about 2 hours.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Now the fun part: caramelizing. If moisture has formed on top of the <em>leite- creme,</em> blot it away with paper towels. Sprinkle each custard with about 1 tablespoon of the remaining sugar and pass a kitchen propane torch back and forth over the top until the sugar bubbles and browns, less than a minute. Alternatively, you can slip the bowls under a preheated broiler for 1 to 2 minutes, but watch carefully, because the sugar can burn quickly.

      <p class="nonindent">Lightly dust a work surface with flour, and roll out the pastry to smooth it. Using a pizza cutter or a sharp knife, trim the pastry into an 8-by-8-inch square. Cut the square crosswise and then vertically in half, so you have 4 squares. Cut each in half on the diagonal.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Space the 8 dough triangles evenly on the parchment, and bake until well risen and golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer the triangles to a wire rack to cool.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Meanwhile, combine the rice, zest, ginger, salt, and 4 cups of water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, lower the heat to medium, and cook, uncovered, until almost all the water has evaporated, about 30 minutes. Adjust the heat as needed so the rice doesn’t scorch.</p>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">About 5 minutes before the rice is ready, heat the milk and granulated sugar in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until wisps of steam curl up and the sugar has dissolved. Turn down the heat to low and keep the milk at a gentle simmer. Beat the egg yolks in a small bowl.</p>
    </li>

      <p class="nonindent"><a id="page215"></a>Once the water in the pan of rice has almost evaporated, begin adding the hot milk mixture by the ladleful, stirring lazily with a wooden spoon. Keep up this rhythm of adding milk, stirring, and cooking until the rice slumps gently when mounded and all the milk is incorporated. Remove the pan from the heat.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Spoon some of the thickened rice mixture into the beaten yolks and quickly stir to incorporate. Drizzle the egg mixture back into the pan, stirring constantly. Return the pan to low heat and cook for 3 minutes. The consistency should be lava-like. Remove the lemon zest and ginger. Let the pudding cool to warm, stirring occasionally. Add more milk, warmed over low heat, if the rice thickens too much.</p>

  <p class="center"><span class="big"><em>pastéis de nata</em></span></p>

  <p class="center"><strong><span class="small">MAKES 24 PASTRIES</span></strong></p>

  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">T</span>he reigning monarch of desserts in Lisbon and, frankly, in all of Portugal, is the <em>pastél de nata,</em> or custard tart, the most famous of which can be found in only one place: the Antiga Confeitaria de Belém, on the outskirts of the capital city. Once a sundries shop, the <em>confeitaria</em> was converted to a bakery in the early 1800s, and the pastries have been made there ever since. The <em>pastéis,</em> rich custard encased in crisp, frilly pastry cups, are served warm with a generous sprinkling of confectioners’ sugar and cinnamon.</p>

  <p class="indent">Everything about the pastries is a secret. During all my “official” visits, trying to suss out the recipe, I was carefully steered away from the vault, behind whose locked doors the elements—tree-trunk-thick logs of puff pastry and the custard—are made. While not “official,” this recipe draws upon what I learned, letting me use ingredients and techniques available to the home cook. And it’s pretty tasty, too.</p>

  <p class="extract"><strong><span class="small">ATENÇÃO</span></strong> <img alt="" src="../Images/Leit_9780307885548_epub_150_r1.jpg" /> Pastéis de nata <em>are made in individual ⅓-cup forms (see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_bm1_r1.htm#page251">Sources</a>), which give them their characteristic size and shape and make them eons easier to shape than if made in a muffin tin. If you use a muffin tin (newer ones have a ½-cup capacity), simply press the dough as far up the wells as possible.</em></p>

      <p class="nonindent">Place one still-folded sheet of pastry on a work surface so that a short end is facing you and the thicker fold is to your left. Open the two panels of dough, lightly brush the right panel on both sides with water, and then fold it back into position. Cover with the left panel and press down to seal. Lightly brush the top of the pastry with water, then curl up the short edge and roll up the pastry away from you, as if making a jelly roll. Make sure to keep the spiral very tight. You should have a 3-inch-wide log. Roll it back and forth on the work surface to extend it to 3½ inches. Repeat with the second sheet of pastry. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate.</p>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Whisk the hot cream into the flour mixture until smooth, then pour in the hot sugar syrup. Slowly add the egg mixture, whisking continually, then pour the custard back into the medium saucepan and cook over low heat, whisking lazily, until the mixture lightly coats the back of a spoon and registers 170°F on an instant-read thermometer, about 4 minutes. Pour into a bowl, add the vanilla, and let cool completely.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Have two muffin tins nearby. Using a serrated knife, trim off the uneven ends of one dough log, sawing in a back-and-forth motion, and discard. Cut twelve ¼-inch slices from the log. Repeat with the remaining log, and refrigerate the slices. Work with only 1 slice at a time. Turn it on its side on a very lightly floured surface. Flatten it into a 3-inch circle with your fingers, and fit it into a well in a muffin tin. Press the dough against the bottom and up the sides, creating a raised lip about ⅛ inch above the pan, if using a tin with one-third cup capacity (see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_c008_r1.htm#page217">Atenção</a>). Repeat with the rest of the slices. Prick the shells very well with a fork, and refrigerate the tins for 20 minutes.</p>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Fill the tart shells to the top with rice, dried beans, or pie weights. Slip the tins onto the hot baking sheet in the oven (depending on how large your muffin tins are, you may have to bake the pastries in 2 batches) and bake until the edges of the dough are puffed and brown, about 16 minutes. If the pastry starts to color too much, tent the tins loosely with foil. Transfer to a wire rack to cool, leaving the oven on.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Empty the rice from the cooled tart shells. Some will stick—no big deal. Use a spoon to gently scrape them out. Fill each shell three-quarters full (2½ tablespoons) with the cooled custard. Bake until the custards barely jiggle in the middle, about 12 minutes.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Transfer the tins to the rack to cool for a few minutes, then pop out the pastries and let cool until warm. Dust with confectioners’ sugar and cinnamon.</p>

While we ate, we noticed a big bowl of mousse slowly being emptied. We put in our order early just to be safe.

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Combine the tomatoes and any accumulated juice, the sugar, cinnamon, zest, cloves, and port in a large saucepan. Bring to a strong boil over high heat and skim any foam from the top. Lower the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally. As the jam thickens, stir more frequently until it’s ready, at least 1 hour. Test to see if the preserve is ready: place a saucer in the freezer for 10 minutes, then dollop a spoonful of jam on top and slip it in the fridge for 2 minutes. If it gels, you’re set; if not, continue to cook.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">While the jam is cooking, place a rack or steamer insert in the bottom of a medium pot and fill with water. Bring to a boil, and immerse two 8-ounce glass canning jars, making sure they’re covered by at least 2 inches. Add the metal bands to the pot too. Ladle a cup or so of the hot water into a small bowl and slip in the two canning lids to soften the rubber, about 5 minutes.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">When the jam’s ready, remove the saucepan from the heat and carefully remove and discard the cinnamon, lemon zest, and cloves.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Using tongs, remove the jars and bands from the pot, keeping the water boiling. Place a wide-mouth canning funnel over one jar and ladle in the hot jam, leaving ¼-inch headroom. Repeat with the second jar. Wipe the rims with a wet cloth, top with the lids, and screw on the bands. Lower the jars into the pot and make sure they’re covered by at least 1 inch of water; if not, pour in more. Once the water returns to a boil, process for 5 minutes. Transfer the jars to a dish towel and let cool completely, at least 4 hours.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Test the seals by making sure they’re depressed. If the seal didn’t take, the jam must be kept refrigerated and eaten within 2 weeks. Properly processed jam will last for 1 year in a cool, dark place. Refrigerate after opening.</p>

  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">R</span>ed bell pepper is an important ingredient for the Portuguese, especially in the Alentejo, where it’s made into a paste used to flavor all types of meats. Never having seen the pepper out of its savory role, I was fascinated to discover this recipe at Quinta de Catralvos, headed up by chef Luís Baena. It was used as a “ketchup” on his McSilva (<a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_c003_r1.htm#page105">Mini Salt Cod Sandwiches</a>), a salt-cod riff on McDonald’s Filet-O-Fish, but I found it so good, I serve it alongside cheese, or with grilled game birds, such as pheasant, partridge, and duck; I even stir it into salad dressing. For a simple hors d’oeuvre, spread soft young goat cheese on crusty bread, and top with some jam and a sprinkle of <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_itr2_r1.htm#page29"><em>flor de sal</em></a>.

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent">Stem and seed the peppers. Cut them into 1-inch-wide strips, and carve away any white bits, or they’ll mar the jam’s garnet color. Dump into a food processor and pulse to form a purée.</p>

  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">G</span><em>inja</em> is the Portuguese name for the Morello cherry, a sour cherry cultivar native to Europe. <em>Ginjinha</em> is the wickedly alluring liqueur made from it. On the north end of Lisbon’s Rossio Square, the heart of city life—not to mention the site of a few autos-da-fé in centuries past—is a wedge of a store called A Ginjinha, where they sell nothing but, and where I’ve been known to dally on occasion. The drink is served either with or without a cherry. Adept at extracting the fruit, the barkeeps mangle not a one as they fish them out. Lacking that skill, I store my <em>ginjinha</em> in a wide-mouth jar with a tight-fitting lid.</p>

  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">G</span>ranted, the name doesn’t do this astoundingly good liqueur justice. The recipe, from my friend Ana Taveira, is a staple of the Azores and a deliciously sweet finish to a meal. What surprises most people is that even though it’s made with milk, it has a crystal-clear amber color. The spark of lemon and the finish of chocolate really round out the creamy flavor. Serve the liqueur as a tipple with dessert or by itself as a digestif.</p>

      <p class="nonindent">Pour the Grappa and milk into an impeccably clean half-gallon glass jar with a tight-fitting lid. Scoop in the sugar, chocolate, and lemon. Cover the jar tightly and shake well to help the sugar begin to dissolve. It will look curdled; that’s as it should be, and it’s perfectly safe. Set aside in a cool, dark place and shake or stir well with a clean spoon every day for 10 days.</p>
