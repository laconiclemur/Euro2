<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Found from Asturias to Andalucía, and often using local breeds of cows that graze the fields, beef stew is a staple across Spain.</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">     The key to keeping the meat tender is to <em>marcar</em>—literally “to mark,” which means sear or quickly brown—the pieces first over high heat without crowding the pan and without the pieces losing their moisture. <em>Then</em> you cook it over low heat, very slowly, just letting the bubbles pop up on the surface. Cooking it like this is called <em>chup-chup</em>, pronounced “choop-choop.” The word is onomatopoeiac, and the simmering should sound like it.</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">     As with other stews that have potatoes, “snap” the pieces of potatoes directly into the soup (as opposed to cutting), so that they release more starch and help thicken the dish.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 POUNDS/910 G STEWING BEEF OR VEAL, CUT INTO 1-INCH/2.5-CM CUBES</li>
<li>SALT AND FRESHLY GROUND BLACK PEPPER</li>
<li>3 TABLESPOONS EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL</li>
<li>4 RIPE MEDIUM TOMATOES, HALVED CROSSWISE, SEEDED, AND GRATED <a href="243-chapter179.html#page_339">(SEE PAGE 339)</a></li>
<li>1 MEDIUM ONION, CHOPPED</li>
<li>1 CARROT, CUT INTO THIN ROUNDS</li>
<li>4 GARLIC CLOVES, GENTLY CRUSHED IN THEIR PEELS</li>
<li>½&gt; CUP/120 ML DRY WHITE OR RED WINE</li>
<li>1½&gt; CUPS/360 ML LIGHT BEEF STOCK <a href="238-chapter174.html#page_336">(PAGE 336)</a> OR WATER</li>
<li>1 BAY LEAF</li>
<li>3 MEDIUM WHITE POTATOES</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Season the meat with salt and pepper. In a cazuela, heavy casserole, large sauté pan, or heavy skillet, heat the olive oil over high heat. Working in single-layer batches that don’t crowd the pan, add the meat and sear it, turning as needed, 7 to 10 minutes total. Transfer to a platter and cover to keep warm.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> Reduce the heat to medium, add the tomatoes, onion, carrot, and garlic and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in the wine, cook for 1 minute, allowing the alcohol to burn off, and return the meat to the pan. Turn the pieces to coat. Pour in the stock and add the bay leaf. Bring to a simmer, reduce the heat to low, partly cover the pot, and cook, just letting bubbles slowly break the surface for 1 hour (<em>chup-chup</em>). Stir from time to time to keep it from sticking.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Peel the potatoes. Working over the pan and adding them directly to the stew, break the potatoes into generous bite-size pieces by making a small cut with a paring knife, twisting the blade, and snapping off a piece. (You will hear the noise.)</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Cook for a final 45 minutes over low heat, never letting it boil, until the meat is very tender and the potatoes are tender and slightly crumbling at the edges. Add a touch of water during cooking if needed to keep it loose. Serve in wide bowls.</p>
