<h4><span class="red">cuaresma</span></h4>
<p class="running_first">The forty-day period before Easter known as <em>Cuaresma</em> (Lent) is a period of abstinence and fasting meant to imitate the example of Christ. (The Spanish name comes from the Latin <em>quadragesima</em>, meaning “fortieth.”) On the Spanish table, it is marked by the Catholic prohibition of eating red meat. Although such dietary restrictions have largely become quite relaxed, there are still many traditional Lenten dishes that reflect this ancient practice. These are usually based on fish, eggs, vegetables, and pulses, especially garbanzo beans. In Andalucía, a stewed garbanzo bean and spinach dish <a href="24-chapter10.html#page_36">(see page 36)</a>, typical nearly year-round as a bar tapa as well as homey comfort food, is sometimes called <em>cazuelita de Cuaresma</em> (small Lenten casserole).</p>
<p class="running_first">The food most associated with Lent, though, is <em>bacalao</em>, salt cod. Salting cod is a way of preserving fish that was perfected by the Basques more than a thousand years ago. Until quite recently, bacalao was Spain’s most important fish. This wasn’t only because it could be easily transported and stored, but also because salt cod was an acceptable substitution for red meat during Lent (and on Fridays). Traditional cookbooks often have just a couple of recipes for chicken—and usually rather elaborate, celebration-worthy preparations—but dozens for salt cod. Cooks prepare numerous favorite recipes during this time, including ones with honey, with raisins (see facing page), in “green sauces” heavy with parsley or red sauces with dried peppers <a href="127-chapter92.html#page_183">(see page 183)</a>, made into croquettes, into fritters, as salads, and so on.</p>
<p class="running_first">And, of course, there are some popular Lenten sweets, too. The most famous are fried sweet fritters called either <em>buñuelos de Cuaresma</em> (literally “fritters of Lent”) or <em>buñuelos de viento</em> (“fritters of the wind”). The latter is a more poetic description of their fluffy texture. A couple placed in a small paper sack when buying bread make a lovely Sunday treat.</p>
