<h2 class="h2b">DAURADE GRILLEE AU PISTOU DE COQUILLAGE</h2>
<h3 class="h3"><em>Grilled Sea Bream with a ‘Pistou’ of Shellfish</em></h3>
<p class="normall0"><em>I used</em> marbré, <em>the very beautiful marbled sea bream, for the photo, but any type of sea bream would be fine. The silver-blue</em> daurade royale, <em>the</em> daurade rose <em>known in Italy as</em> bocca d’oro <em>for its golden mouth, and the pink-gold</em> pagre <em>are often stuffed with fennel and grilled whole or cooked in crusts of sea salt. This mixture is a type of</em> soupe au pistou <em>with shellfish added. The</em> pistou <em>mixture can be cooked a few hours in advance up to the point of adding the shellfish. Should you find fresh beans difficult to obtain, just omit them</em>.</p>
<div class="hang0">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">FOR 4</span><br/>
4 large fillets sea bream, each 150g (5½ oz)<br/>
A little extra virgin olive oil for grilling<br/>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
</div>
<div class="hang00">
<p class="hangz"><span class="smallcaps">PISTOU OF SHELLFISH</span><br/>
1 large red pepper, seeded and cut into large dice<br/>
50ml (2fl oz) extra virgin olive oil<br/>
1 small white onion, peeled and roughly chopped<br/>
2 garlic cloves, peeled and cut into large dice<br/>
500g (1lb 2oz) fresh white haricot beans, 250g (9oz) shelled weight<br/>
1 large courgette, cut into large dice<br/>
24 clams, well rinsed<br/>
24 mussels, de-bearded and rinsed<br/>
3 Roma tomatoes, seeded and chopped<br/>
1 small bunch fresh basil, leaves picked from the stalks, chopped</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Preheat your grill to high.</p>
<p class="normala">Sweat the diced red pepper in the oil for 5 minutes, then add the onion and garlic and sweat for 5 minutes more. Add the beans and just enough water to cover, then simmer for 25 minutes until the beans are soft and the liquid has all but gone. Transfer the mixture to a large shallow pan with a tight-fitting lid and add the courgette, clams and mussels. Cover and cook quickly for about 5 minutes until the shellfish open (discard any that don’t).</p>
<p class="normala">While the shellfish are cooking, lay the fillets of bream on a tray, brush them with olive oil, season well and grill for 6–8 minutes. Mix the chopped tomato and basil with the shellfish mixture and serve with the bream.</p>
