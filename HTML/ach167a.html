<p class="author1"><span class="txit">castagnole o frittole della mamma bertilla</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">As we were preparing this cookbook, Gianni thought to include this recipe, which brings back great memories of the sights, flavors, and excitement of the festivals that are held in Italy, as in many other countries, before Lent. “My mother prepared these fritters for us only during that time of the year,” says Gianni, explaining: “<span class="txit">Castagnole</span> are fried in batches and are similar to a doughnut without the hole.” Note: They cook best in a cast-iron pan.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cups all-purpose flour</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 teaspoons cornstarch or potato starch</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> teaspoon baking soda</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> teaspoon kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup raisins (optional)</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon rum or grappa</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup (<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> stick) butter, softened</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons granulated sugar</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 large egg</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 teaspoons lemon zest</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup plus 1 tablespoon milk</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> teaspoon pure vanilla extract</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Corn or canola oil for frying</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Confectioners’ sugar for dusting</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Sift the flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Set aside. (If you are using the raisins, soak them in the rum for 5 minutes.)</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> In a small bowl, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and beat until combined. Add the lemon zest, milk, vanilla, and rum. (Stir in the raisins if using.) Add to the dry ingredients and mix well to create a batter that is slightly thicker than pancake batter and can be pushed off the spoon with your finger. If it is too thin, stir in a small amount of additional sifted flour. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Line a large plate with paper towels and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_333"/><span class="red">4.</span> Fill a medium-size sauté pan with corn oil to a depth of 1 inch. Heat until almost smoking (about 425° F). Scoop out a generous tablespoon of batter and add it to the oil. It should bubble and float in the oil. Slowly add more batter, a generous tablespoon at a time. Cook in small batches, turning in the oil, until the castagnole are dark brown and cooked through, about 3 minutes. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon, and drain on the paper-towel-lined plate. Allow to cool slightly, then transfer to a serving dish. Place the confectioners’ sugar in a fine-mesh sieve and shake over the castagnole to lightly dust. Serve immediately.</p>
