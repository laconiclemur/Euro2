<h1 class="chapter1"><a id="page_108"/>POLLO TOSCANO ALLA GIANCARLO</h1>
<h1 class="chapter">giancarlo’s tuscan chicken with rosemary &amp; garlic</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>This is a family favourite as it is really simple to make, everyone loves it and it can be left in the oven to cook while you get on with something else. It doesn’t have to be made from thighs – a jointed chicken also works well. The chicken is also delicious cold and served sliced in a <i>panino</i> with mayonnaise.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">SERVES 4 PEOPLE</span></h4>
<p class="hang"><b>8 chicken thighs, bone in and skin on</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt and freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>8 short sprigs of rosemary</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>8 garlic cloves, skin on and lightly crushed</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>100 ml (3½ fl oz/scant ½ cup) white wine</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F/Gas 4) and line a baking tray with baking parchment. Season the chicken thighs generously all over with salt and pepper. Lay the rosemary and garlic in the baking tray and put the chicken thighs on top, skin side up. Drizzle over the oil and put the chicken in the oven for 30 minutes, then splash the white wine around the chicken but not onto the crispy skin. Return the chicken to the oven and bake for a further 20–30 minutes or until cooked through and the meat falls from the bones (the cooking time will depend on the size of the thighs). Serve with roast potatoes or salad on a separate plate.</p>
