<p class="noindent">As she approached my table with a plate of tomatoes, Paquita Rexach, co-owner of Hispania, a legendary Catalan country restaurant, stated, “the seasonal is sacred.” They were raw, cut into wedges, barely dressed, and at first glance, not much to look at: pinkish rather than blazing red, irregularly shaped, with a hollow where one normally expects flesh. But the flavor … intensely aromatic and possessing the perfect balance between sweetness and acidity, they reminded me of what a true tomato should taste like. At Hispania, tomatoes aren’t a side dish, or—perish the thought—garnish. They’re a stand-alone seasonal treat, meant for the diners to worship and pay dearly for. And while Hispania has many great things on its menu, what everyone mentions when they talk about the restaurant are those amazing <em>tomates de Montserrat,</em> the tiny white ganxet beans, the sweet peas grown in the nearby town of Llavaneras.</p>
<p class="indent">And yet tourists accustomed to a meat-and-three-veggie mentality often quip that Spanish restaurants don’t serve enough vegetables. What they don’t realize is that on Spanish menus vegetables tend to be their own <a id="page_368"/>category, not a free filler that justifies the high price of an entrée. (Spaniards generally are not big on side dishes.) And because vegetables are frequently eaten as a first course or a light meal, the preparations are often rather substantial: the tumbet of Mallorca, with its autumnal layering of potatoes, eggplants, zucchini, and a bright-red tomato sauce; the menestras of La Rioja, stews that combine both braised and batter-fried vegetables; the vegetable ollas (pots) of the Mediterranean Alicante region; the Castilian braised green beans bolstered with smoky cured ham.</p>
<p class="indent">Anyone who doubts the importance of vegetables to Spanish cuisine should visit a good local market to admire the shrinelike displays of purple-tipped artichokes, slender wild asparagus, and fuzzy baby zucchini with their yellow flowers attached. I’ll never forget being berated by a burly <em>verduras</em> vendor at the Mercado de la Brecha in San Sebastián. She screamed long and hard (and in Basque, so to this day I have no clue what she said), flailing her arms, shaking her head, and pointing to her precious leeks, peas, and lettuces. My offense? Apparently I handled her wares in a way that she found disrespectful.</p>
<p class="indent">That same day, the three-star Michelin chef Juan Mari Arzak invited me to share a staff lunch around a long marble table in the back of his restaurant. When I came in, everyone from the dishwasher to Arzak himself was eating peas. This was their meal—just peas, briefly cooked and topped with poached eggs. “Why eat all the fancy stuff in the main dining room,” Arzak chuckled, “when the first peas of the season are such a <em>maravilla?</em>”</p>
<p class="indent">Dinner that night was at Mugaritz, a restaurant nestled in the hills outside San Sebastián, among haystacks and fat cows that graze on rich local grasses. Mugaritz is the domain of the experimental young chef Andoni Luis Adúriz, whose menus are mainly centered on vegetables. The pièce de résistance of my meal was, again, peas, in a dish called <em>lágrimas de guisantes,</em> or tears of peas. Caught in fleeting transition between sprout and legume, the peas were smaller than lentils, and snapped in the mouth with the freshness of spring. Coated in a veil of ginger gelée and strewn with tiny wildflowers, the dish was heart-stoppingly lyrical. “Perfect vegetables,” said Andoni, “are the world’s greatest luxury.”</p>
<p class="indent">It is in this spirit that I invite you to dig into the dishes in this chapter. While they will taste fine made with supermarket vegetables, when prepared with the seasonal spoils of a trip to a farmers’ market they will truly shine.</p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ALCACHOFAS FRITAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">During artichoke season, Spanish restaurants and bars usually serve a starter of these crisp artichoke slices fried in a simple batter of flour and eggs. They are so good that one order is never quite enough, and a main dish seems almost redundant. If you can get your hands on tender baby artichokes, you don’t need to cut down to the heart: Just trim off the tops and the leaf tips, and quarter the artichokes (you will need six or seven). Though these are normally served without sauce, feel free to offer any of the <em>allioli</em> recipes in this book alongside (see <a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_44">pages 44</a> and <a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_45">45</a>).</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>4 medium-size artichokes, pared down to the heart (see <a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#ch12_box1">box</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 lemon, cut in half</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About 1½ cups all-purpose flour, for coating the artichokes</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Olive oil, for frying</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 large eggs, beaten in a shallow bowl</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea), for sprinkling the artichokes</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Drain the acidulated water from the prepared artichokes and cut each heart crosswise into thin slices, including the stems. Rub the slices with the cut side of a lemon half. Cut the remaining lemon half into wedges and set aside for serving.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the flour in a medium-size bowl. Place a few artichoke slices in the flour and toss well, scooping under the artichoke to make sure the slices are generously coated. Place the floured artichoke slices in a sieve over the flour bowl and shake off any excess flour. Repeat with the remaining artichoke slices.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Pour olive oil to a depth of 1½ inches in a heavy, medium-size saucepan and heat it over medium-high heat to 360°F. When the olive oil reaches 360°F, dip 5 or 6 artichoke slices in the beaten egg, then gently shake off the excess. Fry the slices in the hot oil, turning once, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried slices to a plate lined with a double thickness of paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining artichoke slices, adjusting the temperature so that they don’t burn. Place the artichokes on a serving plate, sprinkle them with salt, and serve with lemon wedges. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4 TO 6 AS A TAPA OR APPETIZER</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3">ROASTED BABY ARTICHOKES WITH COGNAC</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ALCACHOFAS ASADAS CON COÑAC</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Roasted vegetables are a great specialty at Quim de la Boqueria, my favorite breakfast counter in Barcelona. Asparagus with white wine, baby artichokes with a dash of cognac—extremely <a id="page_370"/>simple and always incredibly satisfying. Roasting the artichokes intensifies their flavor, bringing out their nuttiness. While tender baby artichokes with edible chokes are best, regular artichoke hearts cut into wedges will work also. Serve these as part of a tapas spread, with toothpicks and one of the <em>alliolis</em> or as a side dish with roast chicken or lamb. The artichokes are also great mixed with other vegetables, such as roasted potatoes or the baked cherry tomatoes on <a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#page_390">page 390</a>.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>About 1½ pounds baby artichokes, or 6 or 7 regular artichokes pared down to the heart (see <a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#ch12_box1">box</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons cognac or brandy</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Flaky sea salt, such as Maldon, for serving</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 lemon, cut into wedges, for serving (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Allioli, for serving (optional; <a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_44">pages 44</a> and <a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_45">45</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 400°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Drain the acidulated water from the prepared artichokes and pat them dry with paper towels. Cut the baby artichoke hearts in half lengthwise. If using regular artichokes, cut each heart into 6 wedges.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Place the artichokes and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large bowl and toss to coat. Arrange the artichokes in a baking dish that can fit them snugly in a single layer and sprinkle the cognac over them. Place a round of waxed paper on top of the artichokes and seal the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil. Bake the artichokes until they are tender, 25 to 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Increase the oven temperature to 450°F. Drizzle the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over the artichokes, then bake, uncovered, stirring once or twice, until the artichokes are nicely browned, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Serve the artichokes warm or at room temperature, sprinkled with the parsley and sea salt and accompanied by lemon wedges and/or <em>allioli.</em> <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4 TO 6 AS A TAPA OR SIDE DISH</strong></span></p>

<p class="box-title">PREPARING ARTICHOKE HEARTS</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Most people think of trimming artichokes down to the heart as a cumbersome chore, but it needn’t be. To remove all the extraneous leaves in one spiral motion—as Spanish chefs do—all you need is a sharp knife and a little practice. For best results, select very fresh, unblemished artichokes with tightly closed leaves.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Choose as many artichokes as you need, then cut two lemons in half. Partially fill a bowl with water and add the juice from one of the lemons. Drop the squeezed lemon halves into the water. Working with one artichoke at a time, remove about half of the outer leaves by pulling them away from the artichoke until they snap off. Using a sharp knife, cut off and discard the top half of the artichoke. Place the artichoke on its side on a cutting board and firmly grab onto the stem with one hand. Holding a sharp, serrated knife in the other hand and cutting away from you, remove all but the tender, yellow-green inner leaves, following the contour of the artichoke and leaving only the heart. Using a spoon, scoop out the choke and the small purple leaves from the center. Trim all but a half inch off the stem. Using a sharp knife or a vegetable peeler, trim off the tough, fibrous parts around the base of the artichoke. Scrape the remaining stem with a vegetable peeler. As you work, keep rubbing the cut parts of the artichoke with the cut side of one of the remaining lemon halves to prevent the artichoke from discoloring. Place the artichoke heart into the lemon water until ready to use.</p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_372"/>BREAKFAST AT LA BOQUERIA</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">There is nothing like spending the morning with your nose pressed against the cases of Quim de la Boqueria, a tiny dining stand at Barcelona’s most famous market. Behind the small glass vitrines, anchovies glimmer like silver dollars soon to be gently heated with garlic and olive oil. Arrayed on ice, the extravagantly priced <em>cigalas</em>—langoustines—are alive and so pretty it seems improbable that someone could be cruel enough to toss them on a cast-iron griddle. Quim, the owner, takes roast artichokes and asparagus out of the oven, then arranges vegetable-filled omelets on platters. What will my breakfast be, he wants to know. I point to the aromatic pile of chanterelles and cèpes on the counter. He nods. Do I want them with a bit of foie gras? I shake my head, no. He scratches his head, then turns to his frying pan. A few minutes later I receive a lavish timbale of mushrooms and lentils (see <a class="nounder" href="ch10.html#page_308">page 308</a>). It’s crowned with a fried egg with a bright orange yolk and decorated with drizzles of syrupy aged balsamic vinegar. My friend is having the tiniest, sweetest baby squid in a garlicky puddle of olive oil. Soon we’re on our third round of <em>cava.</em> I look at my watch. It’s eight o’clock in the morning. At the counter beside us, market vendors are finishing their morning papers and hastily gulping rations of <em>pan con tomate</em> and <em>café con leche,</em> getting ready to return to their stalls and battle the crowds.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong>Spring Artichoke Ragout with Ham and Sherry</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Spring in Spain brings many pleasures, not the least of which is this delicious stew. There are as many versions as there are cooks: Some add peas, others potatoes. The stew can be flavored with the smoky notes of <em>jamón</em> or a touch of pounded fried almonds. In any case, the stew’s sweet essence of spring remains the same. Feel free to substitute leeks for the onions and fresh shelled peas and/or sliced asparagus for the fava beans (tender asparagus and peas should be added in the last ten minutes of cooking). You can also use six to eight tender baby artichokes instead of the larger ones. There’s no need to pare them; just trim off the stems and the leaf tips. If you use baby artichokes, cook the stew about ten minutes less.</p>
<p class="indent">This isn’t your bright-green, flash-cooked al dente California version of the Mediterranean. To be really good, sweet, and authentic, the vegetables have to braise for quite some time. What’s lost in color is gained in taste. Serve the stew on its own as a first course, as a light lunch, or as a side dish with roast lamb, chicken, or fish.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong><a id="page_373"/>1½ cups shelled fresh fava beans (about 1½ pounds unshelled), or 1½ cups soybeans or peas, thawed if frozen</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 medium-size artichokes, pared down to the heart (see <a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#ch12_box1">box</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 lemon, cut in half</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 tablespoons fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size onion, quartered and thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 piece (3 to 4 ounces) serrano ham or prosciutto, finely diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 large garlic cloves, minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size Yukon Gold potato, peeled and cut into ½-inch dice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 to 4 ounces green beans (preferably Italian flat beans), trimmed and cut into 1½-inch lengths</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup dry sherry</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1¼ to 1½ cups chicken stock or broth, or water</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>

<p class="uln"><strong>1 squeeze of fresh lemon juice (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Bring a pot of water to a boil, then add the fava beans and cook until just tender, 2 to 4 minutes.

<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Drain the acidulated water from the artichokes and cut each heart crosswise into ¼-inch-thick slices, including the stems. Rub the slices with the cut side of the lemon halves to prevent discoloring, then set aside.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a heavy 4-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and ham and cook, stirring, until the onion is limp, about 5 minutes. Add half of the garlic and the sliced artichokes and cook, stirring, for about 1 minute. Partially cover the pan and continue cooking until the artichokes are almost tender, 5 to 7 minutes, adjusting the heat so that the artichokes cook without browning. Add the potato and green beans and cook for 1 minute, stirring. Add the sherry, increase the heat to high, and cook until slightly reduced, about 1 minute. Add enough stock to barely cover the vegetables and season with salt and pepper to taste. Reduce the heat to very low and simmer the stew, partially covered, until all the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. Add the fava beans and cook until tender, about 5 minutes longer.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Place the parsley and the remaining garlic in a mortar and, using a pestle, mash them to a paste. Add the parsley mixture to the stew.

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ESPARRAGOS CON MIEL Y VINAGRE DE JEREZ</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">This is one of those Spanish dishes that leaves you wondering how something so elemental—little more than asparagus, vinegar, and honey—can <a id="page_374"/>taste so memorable. It also makes you appreciate the transformational effects of good salt. Here I recommend a delicate flaky variety, such as Maldon, beloved by Spanish chefs. Make this in the spring when the asparagus is fat but tender. If you don’t have a grill, asparagus is just as delicious broiled.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>2 pounds beautiful fat asparagus, trimmed</strong></p>

It is so lovely that I prefer to serve it as a first course rather than as a side dish, where it tends to get lost in the shuffle.

<p class="box-title"><a id="page_375"/>ASPARAGUS</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">As wild as the Spanish are about artichokes, eggplants, and peppers, <em>the</em> springtime treat is a plate of perfect asparagus. Spain is one of Europe’s largest asparagus producers. Much of it grows in the vegetable <em>huertas</em> of Aranjuez—a palace town not far from Madrid also known for its strawberries—as well as in the fertile plots of Navarra and La Rioja. The reverence for asparagus in these central regions, where it’s often consumed as a delicious conserve, is summed up by a popular joke. A man from Navarra goes to Bilbao. Upon seeing Frank Gehry’s titanium-sheathed Guggenheim Museum, he exclaims: “Wow, if this is the can, I can’t wait to taste the asparagus!”</p>
<p class="sb-indent">The Phoenicians are widely credited with introducing asparagus to the Mediterranean. But it was the Arabs’ belief in the vegetable’s aphrodisiac properties (blame it on the phallic shape) that was responsible for its widespread appreciation on the Iberian peninsula. Spanish asparagus comes in more than just one, pale-green variety. Topping the list is the wild <em>triguero</em> asparagus, which traditionally grow amid <em>trigo,</em> or wheat. Not much thicker than a wooden skewer and with an incomparably wild bitterish flavor, <em>espárragos trigueros</em> are best when folded into a simple <em>revuelto,</em> or added to vegetable stews. White asparagus, produced mainly in the Navarra region, is another Spanish delicacy. The pale porcelain color isn’t the result of a particular plant variety but is due to the fact that the asparagus doesn’t see daylight while the tender shoots are sprouting (the shoots are covered with loosely packed earth until they’re picked). Fat and buttery, white asparagus is delicious when poached and allowed to cool slightly, then served in a simple vinaigrette or, perhaps, with a shaving of truffles or a drizzle of truffle oil. It’s also one of the best canned products around. As for <em>espárragos verdes,</em> I’ve enjoyed it in Spain fried and roasted, grilled and braised, plain or with rather elaborate sauces. In season, there have been times when I ate green asparagus with every meal—a treat, indeed.</p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>JUDIAS VERDES CON JAMON</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Vegetables cooked al dente may be fashionable and pretty to look at, but often they can’t compare to the sweet, fully realized flavor of vegetables slowly cooked. Green beans, parboiled and gently braised with garlic and smoky bits of <em>jamón,</em> are pretty fundamental to Spanish cooking. They’re eaten more often than not as a first course or even as a light meal—fantastic topped with a fried egg! If you can find them, Italian flat beans would actually be a more authentic choice here.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1¼ pounds string beans or broad green beans (Italian flat beans), trimmed (if using broad green beans, cut them into 2-inch lengths)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 to 4 tablespoons fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small onion, quartered and thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 piece (3 ounces) serrano ham or prosciutto, finely diced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 large garlic cloves, minced</strong></p>

<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Heat the olive oil in a large earthenware <em>cazuela</em> or a deep skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onion and cook until soft but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add the ham and garlic and stir for 1 minute. Add the boiled beans and the paprika and stir to coat with the olive oil. Add the sherry, tomato, and chicken stock. Season with salt and pepper to taste, cover the <em>cazuela,</em> and cook the beans, stirring occasionally, until they are extremely tender and sweet and the liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes. Let the beans cool for about 5 minutes, then sprinkle with the parsley and serve. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4 AS A SIDE DISH</strong></span></p>

<p class="noindent">Besides baked <em>besugo</em> (bream), and roast turkey or capon, the traditional <em>madrileño</em> Christmas feast always includes <em>lombarda,</em> the delicious red <a id="page_377"/>cabbage slowly braised with apples and smoky salt pork until all the flavors meld. Some versions of the dish include diced potatoes; others have raisins and pine nuts, so feel free to play around with the ingredients. Pancetta makes a good substitute for Spanish salt pork, but for a vegetarian dish you can skip it. This cabbage is excellent with roast pork, turkey, or game.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 tablespoon olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size onion, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 to 3 ounces sliced pancetta, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 to 7 cups thinly sliced red cabbage (from 1 large head)</strong></p>

<h3 class="h3">BABY CARROT AND CHARD STEW FROM GABRIELA’S GARDEN</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ZANAHORIAS CON ACELGAS DE LA HUERTA DE GABRIELA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">My friend Gabriela was squatting in the vegetable patch of her sprawling farm, digging baby carrots from the moist soil and inhaling greedily. “Smell this,” she said, swooning from the sweet perfume. Once we filled our basket with carrots, we moved on to the chard and the onions. Figuring out what to do with our booty was a no-brainer. As Gabi’s farm is in Extremadura, she prepared the vegetables like the locals, braised with a few dried chiles, a good dose of smoky <em>extremeño</em> paprika, and a <em>majado,</em> a pounded mixture of garlic, parsley, and peppercorns. While the dish tastes fine with supermarket vegetables, seasonal baby carrots and chard from the farmers’ market will make it truly special.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong><a id="page_378"/>⅓ cup plus 1½ teaspoons fragrant extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small white onion, quartered and thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 medium-size garlic cloves; 2 sliced, 3 chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound whole trimmed farm-fresh baby carrots, or 1 pound slender young carrots, trimmed, cut in half, then cut into 1½-inch chunks</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small whole dried ñora pepper or ancho chile, stemmed, seeds shaken out</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size bunch Swiss chard (leaves only), sliced (3½ to 4 cups)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon smoked sweet Spanish paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ teaspoon whole black peppercorns</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon best-quality red wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Boiled new potatoes or rice, for serving</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Heat ⅓ cup of the olive oil in a wide, heavy flameproof 4-quart casserole over medium heat. Add the onion and the sliced garlic and cook until wilted but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add the carrots and the ñora pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the carrots are almost tender, about 7 minutes, reducing the heat if they’re browning. Add the chard and cook, stirring and tossing, until wilted, about 2 minutes. Add the paprika and stir for a few seconds; then add ½ cup water. Cover the casserole, reduce the heat to low, and cook the vegetables until they are very tender, about 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Place the chopped garlic cloves and the parsley, peppercorns, a large pinch of salt, and the remaining 1½ teaspoons olive oil in a mortar and, using a pestle, mash them to a paste. Stir the parsley mixture into the casserole. Rinse out the mortar with a few tablespoons of the vegetable cooking liquid, then add this as well. Add the vinegar and cook, uncovered, until the flavors meld, about 5 minutes. Let the stew cool to warm, transfer it to a bowl, and serve with boiled new potatoes or rice. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4 AS A FIRST COURSE OR SIDE DISH</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3"><span class="green-1">EGGPLANT “FRIES” WITH HONEY DRIZZLES</span></h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>BERENJENAS FRITAS CON MIEL</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Combining eggplant with either sugar, honey, or cane syrup (which offset its slight bitterness) is an Arab legacy, encountered frequently in both Catalan and Andalusian cooking. (Eggplant jam is quite common in Spain.) These ethereal eggplant “fries” with a light drizzle of honey are one of the most inspired examples of this pairing. The recipe is from Santiago López, chef at La Gaviota, a lovely little bistro off the tourist trail in Granada.</p>
<p class="indent">The secret to flawless frying is coating the eggplant in a slightly coarse wheat flour or semolina, being scrupulous about shaking off the excess—<a id="page_379"/>and using the best-quality olive oil, at just the right temperature. An instant-read thermometer is indispensable.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>8 to 10 ounces slender Asian eggplant (about 1½ eggplants), stemmed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Olive oil, for frying</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About 1½ cups semolina, preferably coarse or medium ground, or a mixture of half all-purpose flour and half medium-ground cornmeal</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 to 3 tablespoons honey</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Peel the eggplants with a vegetable peeler and cut them into sticks that are approximately 4 inches long and ½ inch thick.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Pour olive oil to a depth of 1½ inches in a deep, heavy skillet and heat it over medium-high heat to 360°F. As the oil heats, sift the semolina and 2 teaspoons salt into a medium-size bowl. Place 6 to 8 eggplant sticks in the semolina and toss well, scooping under the eggplant to make sure the pieces are thoroughly coated. Place the coated eggplant in a fine sieve over the flour bowl and shake off the excess semolina.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> When the olive oil reaches 360°F, fry the eggplant sticks until crisp and golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes total. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried eggplant to paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining eggplant sticks, working in batches of 6 to 8.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Place the fried eggplant sticks on a serving platter, sprinkle them with salt, lightly drizzle honey over them, and serve at once. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 2 OR 3 AS AN APPETIZER</strong></span></p>

<h3 class="h3">EGGPLANT GRANADA</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>GRANADA DE BERENJENAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Here’s another classic eggplant recipe from Mallorca as rendered by the great local chef Joan Torrens. <em>Granada</em> (no relation, I suppose, to the Andalusian town) is a kind of delicate eggplant flan bound with milk and eggs and baked in a mold. The hint of sweet spices suggests an Arabic provenance. Like the <em>tumbet,</em> it is eaten with a bright, compotelike tomato sauce made with red-ripe seasonal tomatoes. I suggest using the slender Asian eggplants that don’t need salting.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_380"/>Serve <em>granada</em> as an elegant first course, a brunch dish, or a vegetarian main course. To gild the lily, try adding drizzles of Basil Oil (page 000) right before serving. And don’t worry about the amount of olive oil—the eggplants are drained well after cooking.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>⅔ cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large onion, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size garlic cloves, minced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small bay leaf</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ pounds slender Asian eggplants, trimmed, peeled with a vegetable peeler, and cut into small dice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 large eggs</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup whole milk</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 to 5 tablespoons plain dry bread crumbs</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size pinch of ground cinnamon</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 dash of freshly grated nutmeg</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground white pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Joan’s Tomato Compote (<a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#page_386">page 386</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fresh marjoram leaves or tiny mint leaves, for garnish</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a medium-size skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onion, garlic, and bay leaf and cook, stirring, until the onion is very soft but not browned, about 10 minutes. Remove and discard the bay leaf. Set the onion mixture aside.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Heat the remaining ⅔ cup olive oil in a very large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the eggplant and cook, stirring, for 3 to 4 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet, and cook the eggplant until the cubes are very soft but still hold their shape, 15 to 20 minutes. If the skillet looks dry, add a little water. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the eggplant to a sieve set over a bowl and let it cool completely. (The eggplant can be prepared up to 3 hours ahead.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 350°F and bring a kettle of water to a boil.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Place the eggs and milk in a large bowl and whisk until smooth. Add the onion mixture, the cooked eggplant, and 3 to 4 tablespoons of the bread crumbs. Stir well to combine evenly. Add the cinnamon and nutmeg and season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Line a 9- by 4- by 2½-inch loaf pan with a piece of aluminum foil, leaving an overhang on two sides. Oil the aluminum foil and generously sprinkle the remaining bread crumbs in the bottom. Scrape the eggplant mixture into the prepared loaf pan and set it in a larger baking pan. Carefully pour enough boiling water into the baking pan to come halfway up the sides of the loaf pan. Transfer the loaf pan in the water bath to the oven and bake until a toothpick inserted into the <em>granada</em> comes out clean, about 1 hour.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">6.</span></strong> Remove the loaf pan from the water bath and let cool to warm or to room temperature. Invert the <em>granada</em> onto a plate and remove the foil, then cut it into thick slices and place on serving plates. Spoon some tomato compote around each portion.

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>BERENJENAS REBOZADAS CON JAMON Y QUESO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Frying in olive oil in a plush batter of flour and egg is one of the most basic and popular ways to prepare vegetables in Spain. At tapas bars in the Basque Country, Navarra, and La Rioja, battered veggies are often fancied up with a stuffing of ham, cheese, shrimp, or béchamel sauce. Oozing cheese, these eggplant “sandwiches” are positively luscious. They are great as a tapa, a sit-down first course, or for brunch. Gruyère would be the first choice in Spain, but you can use an easy-melting cheese such as Munster. <em>Jamón York</em> (boiled ham) in Spain, tends to be of excellent quality and saltier than it is here; try to get ham that isn’t too sweet.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 medium-size eggplant, about 3½ inches in diameter and not too tapered, trimmed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 thin slices boiled ham</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>8 thin slices Gruyère or Munster cheese</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>All-purpose flour, for coating the eggplant</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 large eggs, beaten in a shallow bowl</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Olive oil, for frying</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Cut 16 round slices of eggplant, slightly thinner than ¼ inch. Sprinkle salt lightly on both sides. Cut the ham and cheese into rounds slightly smaller than the eggplant slices. Place a round each of ham and cheese on an eggplant slice, season it very lightly with salt, and top with another eggplant slice. Repeat with the remaining eggplant, ham, and cheese.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Spread flour on a large plate and dip the “sandwiches” in it on both sides, shaking off the excess.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Line a small baking sheet with a double layer of paper towels. Pour olive oil to a depth of about ¾ inch in a medium-size skillet and heat it over medium-high heat to 360°F; when hot, a small bread cube placed in the oil will sizzle and brown on contact. Working in two batches, dip the eggplant “sandwiches” in the beaten egg on both sides and place them in the oil. Fry the “sandwiches” until the batter is deep golden and the eggplant is soft, about 2 minutes per side, adjusting the heat so the oil doesn’t burn. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the “sandwiches” to paper towels to drain. Let the “sandwiches” cool for 3 to 4 minutes, then serve. <span class="blue"><strong>MAKES 8 “SANDWICHES”</strong></span></p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>GRATINADO DE ENDIVIAS Y HINOJO CON ALMENDRAS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Here is my adaptation of <em>cardos con almendras,</em> a wonderful vegetable preparation popular at Christmas time in Navarra and Aragon. <em>Cardos</em> are <a id="page_382"/>cardoons, a vegetable that looks like oversize celery and tastes like artichokes. As cardoons are hard to find in this country, I use fennel and endives, which deliver a rather similar flavor. This is a fabulous dish to serve with a Christmas roast.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>5 medium-size Belgian endives (about 1½ pounds), trimmed but with the root ends left intact</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size fennel bulb (about 1 pound), stalks trimmed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ cups chicken stock or broth</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 tablespoons olive oil</strong></p>

Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to very low, cover the pot, and cook the vegetables until just tender, about 20 minutes. Drain the vegetables well in a colander, then arrange them in a single layer in a 12- by 9-inch gratin pan or shallow baking dish and season lightly with salt. (The vegetables can be prepared a few hours ahead to this point.)</p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>PIMIENTOS VERDES ASADOS CON AJO FRITO</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">Red peppers, with their color and sweet, meaty flesh, tend to get all the attention. But as any Basque or Catalan will attest, roasted green pimientos have just as much character. Moistened with good olive oil and vinegar and sprinkled with garlic chips, these are one of life’s great little pleasures. Serve them with simple roast chicken or lamb, with a grill, or as a tapa. I prefer the more delicate green Italian (frying) peppers, but green bell peppers will also work nicely. As in so many cases, good flaky sea salt is what brings the dish to life.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>8 to 10 Italian (frying) peppers, or 6 large, meaty green bell peppers, cored, cut in half, and seeded</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>⅓ cup fragrant extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing the baking sheet and peppers</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon best-quality red wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Flaky sea salt, such as Maldon</strong></p>

<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil and brush it with olive oil so the peppers won’t stick.

<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> While the peppers are baking, heat the ⅓ cup olive oil and the garlic in a small skillet over low heat for about 2 minutes.

<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">When tomatoes were introduced to Spain from the Americas, they were thought to be poisonous. As for potatoes, they weren’t even deemed fit for pigs. Compared to other New World foodstuffs, which sometimes took centuries to become commonplace, the pepper was a hit from the onset. This despite Columbus’s confusing moniker for the spicy chiles he encountered in the Caribbean. <em>Pimientos</em> is what he called them, a word almost identical to <em>pimienta, Piper nigrum</em> or black peppercorns, the prized spice he was so eager to find. It took botanists centuries to figure out that <em>pimientos</em> (capsicum peppers) and <em>pimienta</em> are entirely different botanical species.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">Today, Spaniards are prodigious <em>pimiento</em> consumers. Dried, smoked, and ground, it becomes <em>pimentón,</em> the indispensable ruddy-hued Spanish paprika. The pointy <em>pimientos de piquillo</em> (see <a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_34">page 34</a>) make the world’s best conserve. There is no <em>romesco</em> sauce without the aromatic dried Catalan <em>romesco</em> pepper. No <em>chilindrón</em> dishes and no bacalao a la vizcaína without the meaty, dried <em>pimientos choriceros.</em> The small, hot guindilla chile is what lends subtle heat to dishes sautéed with garlic and olive oil. Spain’s greatest peppers, however, are all but impossible to find in this country. I’m talking about the small, green, thin-skinned <em>pimientos de padrón,</em> so venerated in their native Galicia that they’re honored with their own fiesta, at which a lot of albariño gets drunk. When fried in olive oil and sprinkled with coarse salt, <em>pimientos de padrón</em> are the most ambrosial of capsicum species, even if eating them is a bit of Russian roulette: Occasionally you get one so hot that not even a sea of bottled water and seven big bread loaves can stop your mouth from burning. Then again, it’s all part of the thrill.</p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>TUMBET</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">This version of <em>tumbet,</em> the famous Mallorcan vegetable casserole, is adapted from Joan Torrens of the restaurant Es Baluard in Palma. Rather unconventionally, Joan adds bell peppers to the tomato sauce, rather than layering them in the casserole with the other vegetables. What you’ll find here is a full, proper <em>tumbet</em> recipe—each vegetable is fried separately in olive oil, as it should be. The results are incomparable, even if the dish does take a bit of time and olive oil. If you prefer, the following shortcuts are possible: The potatoes can be parboiled, rather than fried; the eggplant and zucchini can be generously brushed with olive oil and broiled; and this peppers can be roasted following the instructions in the box on the <a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#ch12_box2">following page</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">One last thing: Peeling the peppers might seem somewhat obsessive and can certainly be omitted. However, it’s very easy (using one of those snazzy serrated vegetable peelers) and eliminates the annoying skin that tends to stick in your teeth. It’s the small details that make food taste outstanding rather than merely good.</p>

Reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet, and cook the peppers until they are very tender, about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste the peppers; if the flavor is not vibrant enough, add the sugar and vinegar, then season with salt to taste. Increase the heat to high and cook until the liquid is reduced a little bit, 1 to 2 minutes. Set the peppers aside.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Heat the remaining 6 tablespoons olive oil in another large skillet over medium heat. Working in two batches, cook the potato slices until light golden and almost soft, about 4 minutes per side. Don’t overcrowd the skillet.

Then, using the same skillet and working in batches, cook the eggplant until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the fried eggplant to paper towels to drain.

<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">As enchanted Mallorca, an island off the eastern coast of mainland Spain, falls prey to blond German sun-seekers, finding true local flavors is becoming more and more of a challenge. Which is why I’m so grateful for chefs like Joan Torrens, who zealously preserves the island traditions at his restaurant Es Baluard, in Palma. Els Baluard is a modest place, with marble tables and tiled floors. All the excitement is on the plates, and most of these feature vegetables in one form or another. Joan oven-braises thick, meaty grouper fillets with peppers, tomatoes, and chard, letting the slow, patient cooking coax out their natural sugars. He fashions eggplants into a wonderful <em>granada de albergines,</em> a lightly sweetened, subtly spiced flan. He gratinées salt cod with a smoky <em>allioli</em> prepared from grilled eggplant. And he makes a stupendous <em>tumbet</em>!</p>
<p class="sb-indent"><em>Tumbet,</em> as any Spaniard will tell you, is the most famous dish of Mallorca, a layered casserole of potatoes, eggplant, zucchini, and peppers accompanied by a vibrant tomato sauce. To show off the ingredients that fuel his kitchen, Joan took me to his neighborhood market. There, at a breakfast counter, I learned that the greatest surprise of Mallorcan cuisine is the bold juxtapositions of the sweet and the savory. “Purely Arab,” Joan said, handing me an <em>ensaimada</em> (the signature Mallorcan coiled pastry), which contained both candied fruit and <em>sobrasada,</em> a local chorizo spread; startling and completely delicious, in a perverse kind of way. Then, Joan whisked me around the produce stalls, which were ablaze with plumlike tomatoes still on their vines; firm, sweet local eggplants; tiny strawberries with a complex floral fragrance; and peppers so bright and luminous I wondered how they could be real. Seeing these raw ingredients, I understood why a simple vegetable dish like <em>tumbet</em> is so glorified on Mallorca.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">The word <em>tumbet</em> means something like flattened, and, as Joan explained, its function at a Mallorcan table is pretty flexible: What’s called a <em>plato unico</em>—a dish that stands by itself—the basic casserole is made in a huge pan to be enjoyed for the rest of the week. <em>Tumbet</em> can be eaten on its own for lunch or supper, served as an accompaniment, or used as a base for grilled or baked fish. It tastes good cold, warm, or at room temperature.</p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ESPINACS A LA CATALANA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">An addictive mélange of spinach, garlic, raisins, pine nuts, and good olive oil, this is one of the best-known Catalan dishes. Its uses in the Catalan kitchen are many—in croquettes (see <a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_65">page 65</a>) or egg tortillas, as a topping for <em>cocas</em> (flat breads), as a filling for savory turnovers or cannelloni, or as a base for baked fish. As a side dish, it goes with just about anything, and nothing beats it in the morning on toast, topped with poached eggs. The recipe is also great made with other wilted greens, such as chard or escarole.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>5 to 6 tablespoons golden or dark raisins</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 packages (each 10 ounces) fresh spinach, or 2 medium-size bunches spinach, tough stems discarded</strong></p>

<p class="uln"><strong>5 tablespoons pine nuts</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the raisins in a small bowl, add very hot water to cover, and soak until plump, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain well and pat dry with paper towels, then set aside.</p>

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>ESPINACAS CON GARBANZOS</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">I don’t think there is a tapas bar in Seville that doesn’t serve <em>espinacas,</em> the classic Arab-influenced specialty of cooked spinach braised in olive oil together with chickpeas and spices. This dish is an example of the Sevillian predilection for <em>tapas de cuchara</em> (tapas eaten with a spoon), which is to say stewy things served in miniature <em>cazuelas.</em> I’m actually not convinced that the saucy spinach functions best as a nibble—although who am I to <a id="page_389"/>argue with tradition?—which is why I’ve included it in the vegetable chapter. When served as a <em>tapa,</em> the spinach is usually accompanied by bread, deliciously fried in olive oil. As a side dish, it’s great over rice.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>2 packages (each 10 ounces) fresh spinach, or 2 medium-size bunches spinach, tough stems discarded</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for frying the optional bread</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 large garlic cloves, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon sweet (not smoked) paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small pinch of crushed red pepper flakes</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¾ teaspoon ground cumin</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon dried oregano</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 large pinch of freshly grated nutmeg</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small pinch of ground cinnamon</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 plum tomatoes, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 can (about 15 ounces) chickpeas, with their liquid</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size pinch of saffron, pulverized in a mortar and steeped in 2 tablespoons very hot water</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small pinch of sugar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea) and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>

<p class="uln"><strong>6 slices (each ¼ inch thick) baguette (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Rinse but do not drain the spinach. Place the spinach in a large, wide saucepan over medium heat and cover the pan. Cook the spinach in the water that clings to its leaves until wilted, 4 to 5 minutes, stirring a few times. Transfer the spinach to a colander and squeeze out the excess moisture by pressing on the spinach with the back of a spoon. When just cool enough to handle, chop it medium-fine.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Heat the 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a 10-inch earthenware <em>cazuela</em> or a large skillet, over medium-low heat. Add half of the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the paprika, red pepper flakes, cumin, oregano, nutmeg, and cinnamon and stir for a few seconds. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring, until the mixture is slightly thickened and reduced, about 5 minutes. Add the spinach and the chickpeas with their liquid and bring to a simmer. Add the saffron, sugar, and salt and black pepper to taste and cook the spinach, uncovered, stirring once or twice, until the spinach is very tender and has absorbed some of the liquid, 8 to 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> While the spinach is cooking, place the remaining garlic in a mortar and, using a pestle, crush it to a paste. Add the vinegar to the mortar and stir the garlic mixture into the spinach. Cook until the flavors meld, 2 to 3 minutes. Let the spinach cool to warm, about 15 minutes, before serving.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> If serving the spinach with the fried bread, pour olive oil to a depth of about ½ inch into a small skillet. Heat it over medium-high heat until a piece of bread placed in the hot oil sizzles on contact. Working in two batches, fry the bread until golden and crisp, about 45 seconds per side. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bread to drain on paper towels.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> To serve the spinach, spoon it into a shallow serving dish. Arrange the fried bread slices around the spinach, and serve. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 4 TO 6 AS A TAPA OR SIDE DISH</strong></span></p>

<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/p0391_01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="caption"><strong>Zucchini “Boats” with Tuna and Roasted Tomatoes</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">When I saw this recipe demonstrated at the Congreso Lo Mejor de la Gastronomía, a showcase for Spanish chefs held in San Sebastián, I instantly wanted to try it. Its creator is Mari Carmen Vélez, one of my favorite chefs in Spain, who cooks at the produce-driven La Sirena restaurant in Alicante. Uncomplicated and infinitely tasty, the dish features lightly steamed zucchini “boats” filled with a tuna and roasted tomato mixture that is then gratineed. Mari Carmen uses <em>atún en salazón,</em> the pungent salt-brined tuna so fundamental to the coastal cuisine of Alicante. While a good canned tuna lacks the <em>atún’s</em> pungent kick, it is still delicious when you add the oomph of <em>allioli,</em> the potent garlic mayonnaise. The tuna filling is also great on its own, spread on crusty grilled bread; feel free to add some chopped black olives to the stuffing mixture. Serve the zucchini as a tapa or a light luncheon dish.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong><a id="page_392"/>3 medium-size ripe tomatoes, quartered and seeded</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing the tomatoes</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 large zucchini (choose ones that are not too tapered), stemmed and cut in half lengthwise</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>12 ounces imported solid oil-packed tuna, or 2 cans (each 6 ounces) Bumble Bee tonno in oil, drained and flaked into bite-size chunks</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup plus 2 tablespoons Allioli (<a class="nounder" href="ch02.html#page_44">page 44</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>About ½ cup plain dry bread crumbs</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 450°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Arrange the tomatoes on a small baking sheet, brush them with olive oil, and bake until soft, about 35 minutes. Leave the oven on.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> While the tomatoes are baking, using a small knife or a grapefruit spoon, scoop out and discard the pulp of the zucchini, leaving shells that are just a little more than ⅛ inch thick. You will have 8 “boats.” Steam the zucchini in a wide steamer set over boiling water until just softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Do not overcook. When the zucchini is cool enough to handle, blot it dry with paper towels and sprinkle the insides with salt.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> When the tomatoes are cool enough to handle, slip the skins off and coarsely chop the tomatoes. Place the tuna, chopped tomatoes, and about 2 tablespoons of the <em>allioli</em> in a mixing bowl and toss to mix. Fill the zucchini “boats” with the tuna mixture. Spread the top of each with 1 tablespoon of the remaining <em>allioli</em> and sprinkle about 1 tablespoon of the bread crumbs on top of each. Set the stuffed zucchini on a baking sheet and bake until the tops are lightly browned, about 10 minutes.

<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>OLLA GITANA</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent">The <em>olla</em> is a typical <em>potaje,</em> which is to say a soupy legume stew served as a first course or a main dish for lunch. In some versions wheat berries are added to the pot. Other renditions include white beans, Swiss chard, potatoes, or eggplant. This <em>olla,</em> so representative of the vegetable cooking of Murcia and Alicante, is called <em>gitana</em>—gypsy—because of its seemingly anarchic roster of ingredients. True, the mixture of legumes and pears is a little unusual, but it results in an incredibly flavorful and original stew. Grilled or toasted country bread and a refreshing vegetable salad are the best accompaniments, but the <em>olla</em> is also great over couscous (<a class="nounder" href="ch11.html#page_365">page 365</a>) or rice.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>1 cup dried chickpeas (garbanzo beans), soaked overnight and drained (see <a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#ch12_var1">Variation</a>)</strong></p>

<p class="uln"><strong>¾ cup chopped white onion</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon sweet (not smoked) paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 medium-size ripe tomatoes, finely chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size pinch of saffron, pulverized in a mortar and steeped in 3 tablespoons very hot water</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons best-quality red wine vinegar, or more to taste</strong></p>

<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Add about 3 more cups of the chicken stock to the pot—enough to cover the chickpeas by about <a id="page_394"/>2 inches. Stir in the pumpkin, green beans, and pears and season with salt and pepper to taste. Increase the heat to medium and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, partially covered, until the vegetables have softened, 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a medium-size skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and almonds and cook, stirring, until golden, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the garlic and almonds to a bowl and set aside. Add the onion to the skillet and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the paprika and stir for a few seconds. Add the tomatoes and a few tablespoons of the cooking liquid and cook until the tomatoes soften and reduce, about 7 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Gently stir the tomato mixture and the saffron into the pot with the chickpeas.

<p class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/line.jpg"/></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">I first fell for Mari Carmen Vélez at a high-profile chefs’ conference in San Sebastián, where Spain’s avant-garde toques gathered to demonstrate their latest experiments. One chef delivered a presentation about working with a liver transplant institute to improve his foie gras—for real! Another demonstrated a futuristic vacuum distiller that can extract colorless flavor essences from ingredients. Among these alchemists, Mari Carmen was the only woman, and there was something disarmingly down-to-earth about her discussion of <em>allioli,</em> the indispensable Spanish-Mediterranean mayonnaise. And her croquettes, filled with <em>allioli</em> in flavors like blood orange and almonds, were such a tour de force I vowed to make a pilgrimage to her restaurant, La Sirena, in the Mediterranean region of Alicante.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">La Sirena is located in Elda, a town utterly nondescript but flush from being the center of Spain’s shoe production. Waiting for a table, my friend and I perched at a polished-wood bar arrayed with an aquarium’s worth of crab, langoustines, and bright red prawns. Then, between bites of gratinéed zucchini with tuna, crisp salt cod fritters, and artichoke hearts stuffed with foie gras, we noticed something utterly strange. Every patron who came into the restaurant was wearing an outlandish costume. Suddenly we were surrounded by a carnival crowd of turbaned Moors, warriors in shiny plastic armor, characters dressed as crusaders, and concubines in frilly skirts. The reason? <em>Moros y Cristianos,</em> a raucous fiesta, which celebrates the 1276 victory battle of the Christians over the Moors, an event that led to the Reconquista—the reconquest—of Spain. Returning from their parade and mock battle, the revelers were streaming into the restaurant, hungry for Mari Carmen’s famous seafood paella.</p>
<p class="sb-indent">The masquerade was completely absorbing, but when the food arrived, everything else faded into insignificance. Each dish that came out of Mari Carmen’s kitchen was full of elegance and Mediterranean luster. There was a sparkling sea bass carpaccio, minimally accessorized with olive oil, tiny bits of caramelized red pepper, and a scoop of tart apple granita. There was a thin crumbly flat bread layered with silvery anchovies and marinated wild berries. Seared scallops were redolent of citrus juice and candied lemon; tuna <em>escabeche</em> was reinvented with exotic spices like cardamom and Szechuan peppercorns. The pièce de résistance was <em>suquet,</em> a fish stew that smacked of the sea, accompanied by Mari Carmen’s signature almond <em>allioli.</em> It was the kind of dish that could only be prepared by a fisherman’s daughter (which Mari Carmen happens to be). When we were finishing the hazelnut cream with bitter chocolate, Mari Carmen finally came out of the kitchen. She was exhausted, wiping beads of sweat from her forehead. “The Moors and the Christians are driving me nuts,” she complained. “Imagine, making a paella for a rowdy table of thirty.” She was clearly glad that <em>Moros y Cristianos</em> battle in Elda only once a year.</p>

<h3 class="h3">MALLORCAN VEGETABLE STEW WITH BROWN BREAD</h3>
<p class="textcenter"><small><strong>SOPES MALLORQUINES</strong></small></p>
<p class="noindent"><em>Sopes mallorquines,</em> or Mallorcan sops, is a dish as wonderful as it is curious. A kind of “dry soup” of many vegetables and dark bread, it’s a fundamental part of the island’s cuisine. The bread used for the dish is <em>pan moreno,</em> completely unseasoned, unsalted dense loaves designed to soak up other flavors. While cabbage features in most versions, the assortment of vegetables is entirely flexible, dictated by what’s local and seasonal. Feel free to add to or make substitutions in the selection here. Chopped chard, peas, thin asparagus cut into segments, and Italian peppers or, in the winter, potatoes would all be good. During <em>matanza</em> (pig-slaughter) season, pork goes into the pot as well.</p>
<p class="indent">The idea is to braise the vegetables very slowly with little liquid; this renders them mild and almost startlingly sweet. The stew is then layered over stale bread, which soaks up the delicious juices. Traditionally, <em>sopes</em> are eaten accompanied by halved black olives and marinated capers. There <a id="page_395"/>are <em>a lot</em> of great veggies here, but despite the long ingredient list the stew is a cinch. Serve it as a luncheon or a vegetarian meal.</p>
<p class="uln1"><strong>10 to 12 ounces (a medium-size loaf) sturdy unseasoned whole-wheat bread from a bakery, cut into ¼-inch slices</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus ¼ cup for finishing the stew, and a little extra for serving</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size white onion, quartered and thinly sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 medium-size leek, white and some pale green parts, cut in half lengthwise, rinsed thoroughly, and sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 medium-size garlic cloves, sliced, plus 3 large cloves, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 red bell pepper, cored, quartered, seeded, and sliced</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3½ cups chopped green cabbage</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 ounces string beans, trimmed and cut into 1-inch lengths</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>6 fat scallions with about 3 inches of green, trimmed and cut into 1-inch lengths</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4½ teaspoons sweet (not smoked) paprika</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small bay leaf</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ dried small hot chile, such as arbol</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 medium-size ripe tomatoes, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 medium-size artichokes, pared down to the heart (see <a class="nounder" href="ch12.html#page_370">page 370</a>) and quartered, or 1 package (9 ounces) frozen artichoke hearts, thawed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 cups small cauliflower florets</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 cup plus 2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Coarse salt (kosher or sea)</strong></p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">1.</span></strong> Place the bread in a single layer on a large baking sheet and let it dry on a countertop for 4 to 6 hours, turning once. (Alternatively, the bread can be dried by baking in a 300°F oven for about 20 minutes.)</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">2.</span></strong> Heat the 6 tablespoons olive oil in a heavy 5-quart pot over medium heat. Add the onion, leek, and sliced garlic and cook, stirring, until softened but not browned, 6 to 7 minutes. Add the red bell pepper, cabbage, string beans, and scallions and cook, stirring, until the cabbage wilts, 5 to 7 minutes, adjusting the heat so that the vegetables don’t brown. Add the paprika and stir for a few seconds. Add the bay leaf, chile, tomatoes, and 1 cup water and raise the heat to bring to a boil. Place a round of waxed paper directly on the surface of the stew, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for 15 minutes. Stir in the artichokes, cauliflower, the 1 cup parsley, and ½ cup water and let the stew return to a simmer. Season with salt to taste, cover the stew again with waxed paper, and cook, covered, over very low heat, until the vegetables are very soft, 25 to 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">3.</span></strong> While the vegetables are cooking, place the chopped garlic, the remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and a large pinch of salt in a mortar. Using a pestle, mash to a paste, then add the remaining ¼ cup olive oil.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">4.</span></strong> Preheat the oven to 450°F.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong><span class="blue">5.</span></strong> Place a layer of dried bread slices on the bottom of an 11- or 12-inch earthenware <em>cazuela</em> or a deep ceramic baking dish of similar size. Sprinkle the bread lightly with salt and brush with some of the garlic-parsley mixture. Spoon half of the vegetable stew over the bread. Top with another layer of bread, brush the slices with the remaining garlic-parsley mixture, and spoon the remaining stew and its liquid on top. Bake until the flavors meld, about 10 minutes. Let stand for a few minutes before serving. Invite each guest to drizzle his or her portion with a little olive oil. <span class="blue"><strong>SERVES 6 TO 8 AS A LIGHT MAIN COURSE</strong></span></p>
