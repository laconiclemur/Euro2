<p class="author1"><span class="txit">arrosto di coniglio ripieno</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Rabbit is eaten in Italy almost as often as chicken. If you cannot find it at your local grocers, I have found that most American butchers can order rabbit with a few days’ notice. Ask the butcher to remove the bones or, using a sharp knife, cut the meat away by following the shape of the bones. (Reserve the bones to make a sauce.) The meat is then pounded into a neat rectangle, stuffed, and roasted. Because rabbit stays very tender, it may be cooked one day ahead of time and reheated before serving.</p>
<p class="indentb">Serve this dish with roasted potatoes or vegetables, or with sautéed vegetables such as broccoli rabe or escarole. Butterflied loin of pork pounded to a thickness of about <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> inch is also delicious prepared this way. Cook the pork until it reaches an internal temperature of 155° F on a meat thermometer, about 1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> hours.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary leaves</span></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut lengthwise into 1-inch-wide strips</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup pitted prunes</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 carrot, coarsely chopped</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 celery stalk, coarsely chopped</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup dry white wine</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup chicken broth</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Preheat the oven to 325° F. Generously grease a long sheet of aluminum foil with butter. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Place the rabbit between two sheets of waxed paper or plastic wrap. Pound the meat into a large thin rectangle. Transfer the meat to the center of the aluminum foil, with the <a id="page_273"/>long end facing you. In a small bowl, mix the sage, parsley, and rosemary. Sprinkle half the herb mixture on the rabbit. Season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Arrange the strips of chicken breast in a single long line down the center of the rabbit. Arrange the prunes on top of the chicken. Sprinkle with the remaining herb mixture. Roll the rabbit into a neat, tight log. Fold the foil tightly around the rabbit, and twist the foil closed at both ends. Place in a roasting pan.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> In a large bowl, toss the rabbit bones with the olive oil, carrot, and celery. Distribute this around the rabbit in the roasting pan. Bake until the rabbit is cooked through and reaches an internal temperature of 160° F on a meat thermometer, about 1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> hours. Remove from the oven, transfer the rabbit in foil to a cutting board, and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> Set the roasting pan over high heat (or transfer the contents to a wide saucepan). Stir in the flour, wine, and broth. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, to slightly thicken the juices in the pan, about 5 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">6.</span> Slice the rabbit into 1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>-inch-wide portions. Spoon the sauce over the sliced meat, and serve.</p>
