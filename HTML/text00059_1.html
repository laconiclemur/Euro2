 LAMB &amp; MINT PASTIES WITH QUICK APPLE PICKLE</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_blue" id="nad0003077">
<em>If I had a pound for every time I’ve said I wouldn’t eat a pasty for lunch all five days in a week, I would be a very rich lady! I not only love eating pasties, I love making them too, since I enjoy the repetition of preparing things, like on a production line. I love the solitude of doing it alone, and equally the mayhem of appointing different jobs to different members of my family, such as roller, cutter, filler, crimper and eggwash brusher. These pasties are one of my favourite types, filled with soft baked lamb, potatoes, apples, peas and mint. Perfect for a picnic, accompanied by this aromatic apple pickle.</em>

<p class="method" id="nad0003112">
<span class="blue">
<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 First make the pastry. Put the flour, baking powder and salt into a large bowl and mix together. Add the butter and rub with your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs, or do this in a food processor to speed things up.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003113">
<span class="blue">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Add the egg yolks and stir in, using a palette knife. Then add the water a little at a time, still mixing with your palette knife. Get your hands in and start to bring the dough together. You may not need all the water, so add it gradually until the dough just starts to come together.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003114">
<span class="blue">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Flatten the pastry and wrap in cling film, then put into the fridge for 1 hour to chill.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003115">
<span class="blue">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Meanwhile, make the filling: put the potatoes, peas, onions, apples, lamb, mint and salt into a large bowl and mix together really well. Stir in the melted butter, then add the flour and mix until well incorporated. This will thicken any liquid in the pasties as they bake.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003116">
<span class="blue">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Preheat the oven to 180°C/160°C fan/gas 4. Line two trays with baking paper and set aside.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003117">
<span class="blue">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Take the pastry out of the fridge and roll out on a floured surface to a thickness of 3-4mm. Use an 18cm round dinner plate as a template, cutting around it with a sharp knife to create six pastry circles. The circles may shrink a little after cutting – if this happens, gently re-roll them to 18cm.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003118">
<span class="blue">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Take one of the circles and place the filling on one side, making sure you leave enough to fill the other five. Brush the edge of one half of the circle with beaten egg, then fold over the other half and you should have something that looks like a D shape. Crimp the edges using the tip of a fork or the back of a knife.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003119">
<span class="blue">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 Make a hole in the top to allow some air to escape and place on the lined tray. Now do the same with the other five circles. Brush all over with the beaten egg and bake in the oven for 50 minutes. Take out of the oven and leave to stand for at least 10 minutes before eating.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003120">
<span class="blue">
<strong>9.</strong>
</span>
 While the pasties are baking, get started on the apple pickle. Put the oil into a non-stick pan and place on a low heat. Add the mustard seeds, and as soon as they begin to pop, add all the other spices (garlic, ginger, turmeric, fenugreek, chillies, asafoetida and onion seeds). Cook for a few minutes. You don’t want to burn any of the spices, so be very careful.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003121">
<span class="blue">
<strong>10.</strong>
</span>
 Now stir in the vinegar, sugar and salt. Add the apples and water and cook gently for about 20 minutes, until the apples have mostly broken down. You may find some pieces that haven’t, but that’s fine.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0003122">
<span class="blue">
<strong>11.</strong>
</span>
 Leave to cool in the pan, then serve with the pasties. Transfer the rest of the pickle to a clean jar and refrigerate. It can be kept for up to a month in the fridge.</p>
<p class="tip2" id="nad0003123">
<span class="tip_head_blue">Tip:</span>
 <em>When preparing the filling, make sure all the fruit and veg are chopped to roughly the same size, as this helps it all to cook evenly.</em>
