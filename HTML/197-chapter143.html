<p class="yield">MAKES ONE 11-INCH/28-CM CAKE</p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">When we go to Sinarcas, the rural village of my mother-in-law’s family on the Valencian border with Castilla–La Mancha, we leave bearing a hefty country care package, from homemade blood sausages to bottles of wine from the village cooperative and, when the season is right, just-picked almonds in their shell.</span></strong></p>
<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">     One part of the package, though, never makes it home from Sinarcas—Tía Encarnita’s spongy cake. Sometimes she makes a plain one <a href="196-chapter142.html#page_279"><span class="red">(see page 279)</span></a>, but more often than not she adds pear or apple slices to the batter. If we are there in winter, she adds some walnuts from the village, too. She wraps up a big piece, but by the time we are back in Barcelona, there are never more than crumbs left.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3 EGGS</li>
<li>1 CUP/200 G SUGAR, PLUS MORE FOR SPRINKLING</li>
<li>½&gt; CUP/120 ML MILD OLIVE OIL OR SUNFLOWER OIL</li>
<li>1 CUP/240 ML MILK</li>
<li>1¾ CUPS/215 G ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR</li>
<li>2 TABLESPOONS BAKING POWDER</li>
<li>½&gt; CUP/55 G ROUGHLY CHOPPED WALNUTS</li>
<li>1½&gt; TO 2 RIPE BUT QUITE FIRM PEARS, SUCH AS ANJOU, BOSC, CONFERENCE, OR BARTLETT, PEELED, QUARTERED, AND THINLY SLICED LENGTHWISE</li>
</ul>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C/gas mark 4.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> In a large bowl, vigorously beat the eggs and sugar with an electric mixer until pale and frothy. Stir in the olive oil and milk. Blend the flour and baking powder and gradually add to the bowl so the eggs don’t lose their volume. Fold in the walnuts.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Line an 11-inch/28-cm round or springform cake pan or an 8-inch/20-cm square cake pan with parchment paper.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Pour the batter into the pan. Layer the pear slices over the top. Lightly sprinkle with sugar.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">5.</span> Bake until done and golden on top but still spongy (a toothpick poked into the center will come out clean), about 30 minutes. Do not open the oven during baking. Remove from the oven and let cool before serving.</p>
