  <h3 class="h3a">Tyrolean beef stew</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">This classic stew from the Trentino-Alto Adige or South Tyrol region of northern Italy is slow cooked with onions, cumin and paprika – its distinct central European flavour is influenced by neighbouring Austria. The gradual addition of stock gives this stew a gentle flavour; pancetta is added, so be careful not to make your stock too salty. This dish is traditionally served with runny polenta (cornmeal). It is also delicious with a piece of good country bread whose soft part is removed, cubed and toasted; the goulash is served in the bread crust and the toasted bits sprinkled on top – a dish fit for an Austrian king!</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 large onions, sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">100g/3½oz pancetta, cubed</p>

  <p class="ing1">about 1 litre/1¾ pints/4 cups hot <a href="part0007_split_013.html#pg32" class="calibre1">vegetable stock</a> – or use a stock cube</p>

  <p class="ing1">1kg/2lb 4oz stewing beef, cut into chunks</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 garlic cloves, sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 tsp cumin seeds, crushed</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 tsp paprika</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 sprigs of thyme</p>

  <p class="ing2">polenta (cornmeal) or toasted country bread, to serve</p>

  <p class="para">Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan and sweat the onions on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring all the time to prevent sticking, until softened. Remove and set aside.</p>

  <p class="para">Add the pancetta to the pan and cook on a medium heat until coloured but not burnt. Remove from the pan and set aside. Return the onions to the pan, add about 3 tablespoons of stock and cook for a minute or so until the liquid has evaporated.</p>

  <p class="para">Add the beef, increase the heat and brown the meat all over. Add 100ml/3½fl oz/scant ½ cup of stock, reduce the heat to low, cover with a lid and cook very gently for 30 minutes, then add another 100ml/3½fl oz/scant ½ cup of stock and continue to cook for 30 minutes.</p>

  <p class="para">Stir in the garlic, cumin, paprika, thyme and pancetta. Add 400ml/14fl oz/1⅔ cups of stock, cover with a lid and cook over a low heat for a further 1 hour, gradually adding more stock and stirring from time to time to ensure the meat doesn’t stick.</p>

  <p class="para">Remove from the heat and serve with toasted country bread or runny polenta.</p>
