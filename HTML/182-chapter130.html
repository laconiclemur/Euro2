<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Queso Picón Bejes-Tresviso from Cantabria is a compact, ivory-fleshed, blue-veined cheese. While its persistent and bold flavors are highly appreciated on their own, the cheese makes an excellent base for creamy sauces. Around northern Spain, you find different local blue cheeses used the same way to the same stunning effect—in Galicia along the central Río Miño with queixo do Cebreiro, for instance, or in Asturias with queso de Cabrales or queso de Valdeón in León. These same regions also produce excellent beef. An older animal, with a brilliant-to-slightly dark-red tone and deeper flavors, is perfect to use with this bold sauce.</span></strong></p>
