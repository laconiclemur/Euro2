<h1 class="chapter">stocks</h1>
<p class="tx2"><b>Excellent and versatile stock should be made from things you would normally discard in the kitchen. I freeze vegetable peelings throughout the week, adding bendy carrots that have seen better days, celery ends and leaves, pepper cores, parsley stalks, tops and tails of onions and coarse, dark leek ends. I also do the same with raw and cooked chicken bones and carcasses, fish bones and prawn (shrimp) shells. I never bother defrosting the vegetables or meat – I just add them to the pot as they are.</b></p>
<p class="tx3">The better the stock, the better the flavour of the final dish, and a natural flavour is infinitely better than a stock from a cube or powder. Make stocks when you are at home and not rushing about. They need time to bubble away gently and make the house smell like a home. Use them up a few days after making them, or reduce them to an intense, concentrated stock and freeze them in small batches ready for when you need them.</p>
