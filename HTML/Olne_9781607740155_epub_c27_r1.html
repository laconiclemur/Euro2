  <p class="nonindent sgc-1"><a id="page374"></a>This is hardly the menu to serve a group of visiting dignitaries with conventional palates that might object to cold brains and the octopus-like squid in a highly seasoned sauce. But the conception of the menu is not less fine for that. The succession of textures, flavors, colors and temperatures, distinctly different from one dish to another, could not be happier. It is a menu that deserves a fairly formal presentation, but should, no doubt, be shared with friends or guests known to be gastronomically adventurous in spirit.</p>

  <p class="indent">The most difficult detail is the choice of white wine for the squid, for it should be powerful enough not to suffer from the heady personality of the dish, and at the same time fine enough neither to suffer by comparison with, nor to prejudice the palate against, the wine to follow. That which seems to ideally fulfill these requirements is Château-Cahlon, and whether one chooses either to serve a wine of lesser prestige with the squid and the Château-Chalon with the chicken or to serve Château-Chalon with both, it will answer equally well. The trouble is that it is hard come by and the price tends to be steep. A Burgundy rosé (Marsannay) might be drunk with the squid, followed by a Côte de Beaune red.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cold dishes like the chicken in jelly (and game terrines, which in more elaborate menus find their place after the roast) are usually accompanied by a salad. For the qualities of the preparation, as well as those of its accompanying wine, to be justly appreciated, it seems best to withhold the salad at least to the halfway point in the service, offering it with second helpings.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c27-s103"><a id="page375"></a><em><span class="color">Cold Calves’ Brains in Cream Sauce</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Cervelles de Veau Froides à la Crème</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 fresh calves’ brains</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Court-bouillon:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1½ quarts water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ cup wine vinegar</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 carrot</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 onion</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>thyme, bay leaf</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>a large bouquet of parsley</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>10–12 whole peppercorns</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Sauce:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, freshly ground pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 level teaspoon French mustard</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 lemon</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup heavy cream</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 heart fresh, crisp celery</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 tablespoon chopped chives</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Lambs’ brains may be substituted, in which case, 1 brain should be counted per person. Choose brains as white as possible (avoiding those that are coated beneath the membrane with clotted blood), firm and moist-looking on the surface. If your plans are made far enough ahead of time, ask your butcher to procure them freshly for the specified day. Only very fresh brains are easily rid of the surface membrane (butchers have assured me over and over again that I am wrong and that it is a mere question of chance whether a brain is easily peeled or not, and yet, curiously, each time that I have bought brains from freshly killed animals and watched them being cut out of the head, the membrane has slipped off like magic).</p>

  <p class="indent">French <em>crème-double</em> is always very thick (although not always impeccably fresh) and more suitable to this sauce than American <a id="page376"></a>whipping cream (<em>crème-double</em> is pure, unpasteurized separator cream, whereas the heaviest cream available in America today always has a certain percentage of milk homogenized into it). To get a cupful of really thick cream, one must pour a pint of whipping cream into a bowl and leave it, covered, in the refrigerator for 2 or 3 days, then spoon the required quantity off the surface. The remainder will always find a use in some other preparation.</p>

  <p class="indent">Put the brains to soak in a basin of cold water immediately upon unwrapping them. After ½ hour, remove the surface membrane, carefully and delicately—if it resists, return the brain to soak and try another. Occasionally, to one’s total desperation, the membrane sticks like glue no matter how much it has soaked. In this instance, one must simply do one’s best. After the brains have been peeled, return them to a fresh basin of cold water and leave them to soak for up to an hour, changing the water 2 or 3 times. This last is a blanching process, intended to draw out discolorations from the brains. If they are perfectly white to begin with, it is unnecessary.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE COURT-BOUILLON</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Put the water and vinegar to boil, peel the carrot and onion and slice both thinly, and add all ingredients to the saucepan. Leave to simmer, covered, for ½ hour or so—long enough for the aromatic elements to have given their qualities to the liquid.</p>

  <p class="indent">Slip the brains into the boiling <em>court-bouillon</em> and turn down the flame so that they poach at the barest simmer for from 20 to 25 minutes. Lift them out gently, one by one, with a perforated skimming spoon, place them on a plate and cover them with a cloth that has been moistened in the <em>court-bouillon</em> (which prevents them from drying out and discoloring on the surface). Put them to chill in the refrigerator until ready for use. Everything up to this point may be done hours ahead of time. The sauce, however, should be prepared no more than ½ hour to 1 hour before serving.</p>

  <p class="indent">Trim the brains, slice them neatly, and arrange them on a chilled serving dish. Put salt, pepper, mustard and the juice of ½ lemon together in a bowl and stir until thoroughly combined. Pass the trim<a id="page377"></a>mings from the brains through a small sieve, stir them into the sauce, then stir in the cream. Taste and, if necessary, add a bit more lemon juice and additional seasoning. Chop the celery heart into tiny cubes and stir it in. Spoon the sauce over the brains and sprinkle with chopped chives. If one likes, a few of the carrot slices from the <em>court-bouillon</em> may be used to enhance the decorative aspect of the dish. In this case, the carrots should have been peeled with a serrated knife that leaves decorative ridges down the length of each carrot.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="c27.1">THE SQUID A L’AMERICAINE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Squid and cuttlefish are very similar and may be prepared in the same way. In America, squid are easier to find on the market. Tiny cuttlefish are very delicate and need a shorter cooking period (about 20 minutes). The dish is incorrectly named, but so generally known as <em>à l’américaine</em> that it seems useless to rebaptize it. (Any number of dishes are correctly entitled thusly—the sauce in these cases must be based on lobster. A lobster <em>à l’américaine</em>—not <em>à l’armoricaine</em>, as many people insist—is prepared in the same way, except that it must be cut up alive, it needs a shorter cooking period—12–15 minutes—and the sauce is finished with a paste of the mashed coral and butter and mounted with a larger quantity of butter.) This squid is often called the poor man’s lobster <em>à l’américaine</em>. Once tasted, it needs no apology, and, except for those customers who are terrified at the notion of eating anything invertebrate, it never fails to please.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c27-s104"><em><span class="color">Squid à l’Américaine</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Calmars à l’Américaine</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 pounds squid</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 onion</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 pound firm, ripe tomatoes</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 cloves garlic</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><a id="page378"></a><em>3 tablespoons olive oil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, pepper, Cayenne</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 small glass cognac</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>⅓ cup dry white wine</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>thyme, bay leaf</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>4 tablespoons (2 ounces) butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 small handful finely torn up fresh basil leaves (lacking that, fresh parsley)</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Clean the squid: pull the tentacles apart from the conical body, press the outsides of the tentacles at the mouth opening to force the little pouch of clawlike teeth to pop out, remove the eyes and any soft intestinal material that clings to the base of the tentacles. Clean out the inside of the body well and wash the tentacles and the body in several waters. Cut the conical bodies into sections about 1½ inches long. Put them into a colander and leave to drain.</p>

  <p class="indent">Peel the onion and chop it finely. Put it to cook gently in a bit of olive oil or butter until it is soft and yellowed in color. Put it aside. Peel and seed the tomatoes and chop them coarsely. Smash the garlic cloves, peel them and chop them very finely.</p>

  <p class="indent">Sponge the pieces of squid and their tentacles in paper towels to dry them. Heat the olive oil in a heavy <em>sauteuse</em> or large saucepan and throw in the squid. Sprinkle with salt and toss the pieces or stir them around regularly for a couple of minutes, keeping the flame high, until they have retracted in size and become firm. Add the cognac, set fire to it and stir constantly until the flames die down. Add the white wine, reduce a minute, still over a high flame, then add the chopped, cooked onion, the chopped garlic, the chopped tomatoes, a bit more salt, pepper, a small pinch of Cayenne pepper, the thyme and bay leaf; these vegetables, herbs, and seasonings may all be combined in a bowl ahead of time—if one is unfamiliar with a recipe, the process is tremendously simplified by having 1 rather than 8 items to add at a given time. Bring to a rapid boil, stir and scrape the bottom with a wooden spoon to be certain that nothing is sticking, and turn the fire down so that, covered, the sauce simmers. After 45 or 50 minutes (the squid is done when the flesh no longer produces a rubbery resistance to pressure) remove the pieces to a heated serving dish, discard the bay leaf and <a id="page379"></a>reduce the sauce over a high flame, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until it becomes fairly consistent. It should not be too thick, but it must lose its watery consistency. Remove the pan from the heat and add the butter, cut into small pieces. Swirl the pan until all the butter is absorbed into the sauce, and pour it over the squid. Sprinkle the surface with the finely torn up basil leaves (torn only at the last minute or they will be discolored and unsightly) or the chopped parsley. Serve accompanied by a <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#rh3">Rice Pilaf</a>.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c27-s105"><em><span class="color">Jellied Poached Chicken</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Poule au Pot en Gelée</p>

  <div class="block">

    <p class="extract"><em>Bouillon:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 eggs</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, pepper</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><a id="page380"></a><em>Clarification:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 egg whites</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 small handful chopped chervil and tarragon</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>juice of 1 lemon</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 small glass good port (or Banyuls or Madeira)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>decorative elements: hard-boiled egg whites, truffle, black olives, blanched tarragon leaves, canned pimento, fragments of tomato, etc.</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">The bouillon is prepared like the Veal Jelly on <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c26_r1.htm#rh88">this page</a>. The calf’s foot is replaced by chickens’ feet (first turned over a flame until the skin is blistered, then skinned by rubbing them with a towel—the skin and claw nails slip off very easily), the broken-up bones, and the carcass of the chicken. It is this stock that serves as the poaching liquid for the chicken, and subsequently for the jelly.</p>

  <p class="indent">The bouillon should be prepared and the chicken boned, stuffed and poached the preceding day. The finishing decorative touches may be executed on the morning of the day on which the dinner is planned. (If the dish were intended for a luncheon, it would be wiser to finish it the day before.)</p>

  <p class="indent">A much simpler presentation is possible. The additional work of clarification, decoration, and painstaking masking with jelly may be eliminated if one simply places the poached, unwrapped fowl in an oval terrine, pours all the bouillon over it and puts it to cool. It may be served directly from the terrine or turned out just before serving. In the latter case, the chicken should be placed breast side down in the terrine in order to be turned out right side up. To me, it seems a pity to sacrifice the more elaborate presentation in this instance, for the dish lends itself so perfectly to it.</p>

  <p class="center4" id="c27.4"><span class="small">THE BONING PROCESS</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">The chicken is only partially boned, the breastbone, the wing bones and the leg bones remaining. It is possible to remove the breastbone also, if one wishes, but the final manipulations will be more difficult because of the loose consistency of the raw stuffing. The following instructions are for a picked and singed but uncleaned chicken (the <a id="page381"></a>only way one may be certain of its skin remaining intact). The usual commercial product often has its skin ripped open across the breast and the abdomen has always been torn into a huge gash. You may still, with a bit of careful patchwork, approximate the preparation, hiding its imperfections beneath the decoration, so don’t give up, even if your chicken is less than perfect in appearance.</p>

  <p class="indent">As the feet, neck, wing tips, and carcass are removed from the chicken, throw them into the pot of stock (which is already cooking) along with the giblets. The boning process goes slowly the first time, but it is simple and logical, and one need only be relaxed and patient. Work seated at a table, in a good light. Remove the feet, and the wing tips at the second joint. Using a small, pointed, well-sharpened knife, cut the skin of the chicken the length of the back, from the top of the neck to the base of the tail, following the line of the backbone. Pull the skin loose from the neck, being careful not to tear it, and cut off the neck at its base. Loosen the flesh adhering to the skin, following the contour of the rib cage, slicing little by little and, when it is possible, forcing the flesh loose from the bones with your fingers. Slice through the ligaments at the leg-bone and wing-bone joints to liberate them from the body of the skeleton. With care, you will be able to lift out the entire spinal column and the rib-cage section containing the heart, liver, gizzard and intestines. Rather than risk tearing the skin at the tip of the tail, clip the spinal column just before. Remove the wishbone, the “shoulder-blade” type of bones reaching to the wing joints, and the few small flexible bones attached to either side of the breastbone, and, with a pair of kitchen shears, cut vertically through the breastbone, being careful not to pierce the skin of the breast. This permits the chicken to swell, while cooking, into a plump, rounded shape.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="small">NOTE</span>: It is perfectly possible to completely bone a chicken without puncturing the skin at any point except for a small slit on the back of the neck (the method is described on <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c19_r1.htm#page295">this page</a>), and once one understands the principle, it goes more rapidly than the above method and the results are more elegant. But it seems best to acquaint oneself with a chicken’s anatomy by first boning it opened up, rather than to attack the earlier method blindly.</p>

  <p class="center4"><a id="page382"></a><span class="small">THE STUFFING</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Pound the clove of garlic to a paste in the mortar. Add the bread, crumbled or broken up, pour a ladleful of the bouillon over, mix well together, and leave to soak. Pick over the livers carefully, cutting off any parts that are tinged with green and pulling out the whitish membranelike threads that connect the lobes. Place livers in a mound on the chopping board and, with a well-sharpened French chef’s knife, chop them finely, turning the mass over several times (the first time through, they have to be cut, rather than chopped, to prevent their flying all over the place—after that, you can land into them, chopping with loose wrist and machine-gun continuity). Put the chopped onion to cook gently in butter without allowing it to brown. Pound the mixed herbs to powder in a mortar.</p>

  <p class="indent">Press the excess liquid from the soaked bread and put it into a large mixing bowl along with the livers, the cooked onion, chopped parsley, powdered herbs, the 2 eggs, salt, and freshly ground pepper. Mix thoroughly with your hands, squeezing the mixture through your fingers over and over again (there is no other way) until it is completely homogeneous. Taste for salt.</p>

  <p class="indent">Thread a large needle (a curved upholsterer’s needle works most easily) with a good yard of kitchen string. Pierce the skin on either side of the anus. Knot the string, leaving 3 or 4 inches of loose end, and, starting at the tail, sew the chicken about ⅓ to ½ the way up the back, folding the skin in such a way as to leave no possible openings (as you would fold or roll the top and bottom edges of a pie crust under before pinching it). Now pour in the stuffing, lifting and pulling gently at the skin and shaking the bird around a bit to settle the stuffing into the pocket formed by the sewn lower half. Continue sewing almost to the top, then run the needle through the center of the underside of the neck-skin flap, fold the flap over the back (as for sealing an envelope) and sew all around the edges. Wrap the remaining length of string once around the upper part of the chicken, piercing through the wings to fix them in place and, drawing the string diagonally across the breast, wrap it 2 or 3 times around the drumstick ends <a id="page383"></a>and the tail, then tie the two ends of string together. Rub the surface all over with lemon juice to keep it white, and “mold” the chicken in your hands to ease it into its natural form. Wrap it, firmly but without forcing, in a cloth (or a double layer of cheesecloth) and tie the two ends securely.</p>

  <p class="indent">Remove the debris from the bouillon with a large skimming spoon (if a few odds and ends remain, it is of no importance—the bouillon will be strained later), and put the chicken into the pot. Leave the cover slightly ajar and, once the liquid returns to a boil, regulate the heat so that there is the barest suggestion of a simmer. One and one-half hours later, remove the chicken and leave it, still wrapped up, to cool. Pass the cooking liquid through a fine drum sieve (or through a strainer lined with a cloth) and leave it to cool.</p>

  <p class="indent">Unwrap the chicken, place it on the serving plate, and, holding it with one hand, clip the knot in the string and pull one end of it firmly but carefully. It will suddenly give, and the entire length may be slipped out without affecting the chicken’s form.</p>

  <p class="indent">When the bouillon is cold, remove all traces of fat from the surface and clarify it exactly as veal jelly on <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c26_r1.htm#rh88">this page</a>, adding the wine of your choice when the liquid is nearly cool.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE DECORATION</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Cool small quantities of jelly at a time in a bowl placed over cracked ice. First coat the chicken thinly all over with jelly; then dip each element of the décor into the jelly, affix all to the surface of the chicken, and put the dish into the refrigerator for 15 minutes so that the décor may set. Trickle the semiliquid jelly over the chicken, concentrating on the highest points (leg joints and breastbone) over and over again, until jelly is all used up—or, if there is enough jelly, until the outline of the chicken, softened through the undulating coat of jelly, melts into the mirror of clear jelly at its base. Put to chill until serving. The base may be decorated with small bouquets of chervil or parsley.</p>

Stir in the melted butter and the cognac. Do not beat; excessive stirring and beating renders the batter elastic, and it will not adhere properly to the objects to be fried. It is for this reason, no matter how little the batter has been worked, that it is wise to leave it to “relax” for an hour or so before using. It should be fairly liquid (a thicker batter holds its form better, but tends to be spongy, whereas, although a thinner batter disperses threads into the frying oil, it is finer, lighter, and crisper). Leave it to rest an hour or so and, just before using, gently fold in the egg white, beaten stiff. Sponge the excess liquid from the apricot halves, drop ⅓ of them into the batter and, being certain that each is well coated with batter, lift them out, one at a time, with a teaspoon, and drop them into the deep fat. (It should be <a id="page385"></a>hot, but not smoking; let a drop of batter fall in, and if it sizzles immediately, the oil is ready.) When the fritters are golden and crisp, lift them out with a large wire skimming spoon and wrap them in a towel while continuing with the other 2 batches. When all have been fried, transfer them to a serving platter on which has been placed a folded napkin, sprinkle them with powdered sugar, and serve, the surface covered with the flaps of the napkin to keep them warm.</p>
