  <h3 class="h3a"><a id="ch1sec5a" class="calibre1"></a>Chicken broth</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">For the best chicken broth, ask your butcher for a boiling chicken; in Italy this is called <em class="calibre4">gallina</em>, an older hen who has stopped laying eggs and is best used for making broth or <a id="pg22" class="calibre1"></a>stock. Otherwise, a normal roasting chicken will suffice. Chicken stock is used in many recipes, so it is worth making lots: you can freeze whatever you don’t use, or even make a double quantity and freeze in batches. You can serve this as a light broth or a more substantial soup. Alternatively, this recipe makes a lovely two-course meal: you can have the broth with some <em class="calibre4">pastina</em> (small pasta shapes) or tortellini and then enjoy the chicken as a main course with the carrots and onion and some extra vegetables. The chicken can be eaten hot or cold; try it in a <a href="part0009_split_008.html#ch3sec8a" class="calibre1">salad</a>.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4–6</p>

  <p class="ing1">1.5kg/3lb 5oz chicken</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 carrots</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 large onion</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 celery stalks with leaves</p>

  <p class="ing1">a handful of parsley</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 tsp sea salt</p>

  <p class="ing2">4 black peppercorns</p>

  <p class="para">Put all the ingredients in a large saucepan and add 3 litres/5¼ pints/3 quarts cold water, making sure the chicken is covered – if necessary add more water. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover with a lid and simmer gently for 2 hours.</p>

  <p class="para1">Remove the chicken and vegetables from the pan and set aside. Strain the liquid through a fine sieve for a clear broth. Taste for seasoning and add a little more salt if necessary. To serve as a soup, pour the broth back into the pan and reheat, cooking some tortellini or small pasta shapes in the broth if you like. For a more substantial soup, add chopped cooked vegetables, shredded chicken and some pasta.</p>
