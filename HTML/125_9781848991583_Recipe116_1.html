<p class="normal"><b>This is such a lovely dessert, full of an exotic mix of flavors. The pineapple is caramelized with rum—just imagine the aromas rising from the pan. There’s also the delicate vanilla flavor and, to finish, the dry-roasted Szechuan pepper, my favorite of all the spices, with its slightly lemony overtones. Only the husks are used, because the seed is discarded. You will find it used a lot in traditional Chinese cuisine, and here I use it to enhance the dish and raise the pineapple to new heights.</b></p>

<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 15 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxta"><span class="smallcaps"><b>COOKING TIME</b></span> 25 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 large pineapple, peeled, cored, quartered lengthwise and halved widthwise</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 cup light soft brown sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 small vanilla beans, cut in half widthwise, then lengthwise and seeds scraped out, beans reserved</p>
<p class="acktxt">1¼ cups dark rum</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p class="acktxt">¼ cup golden raisins</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ teaspoon Szechuan peppercorns, lightly toasted and gently crushed (see <a href="051_9781848991583_Recipe44.html#pageid_68">page 69</a>)</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 red chili, seeded and finely chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">coconut ice cream, coconut cake or Pistachio Madeleines (see <a href="055_9781848991583_Recipe48.html#pageid_75">page 75</a>), to serve</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Roll the pineapple pieces in the brown sugar to coat all sides. Add the vanilla seeds to the rum and mix well.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Melt the butter in a large, nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the pineapple and cook a few minutes on each side. Add the vanilla beans and cook 8 to 10 minutes longer until the pineapple is golden brown. Add 7 tablespoons of the rum and the golden raisins, turn the heat down to low and leave for a few minutes to reduce, basting the pineapple continuously, until the mixture just forms a light syrup and starts to caramelize. Repeat this three more times, adding one-quarter of the remaining rum each time.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Add the the last of the rum with the Szechuan peppercorns and repeat basting one final until you have a lovely thick, light caramel-brown syrup that coats the pineapple. Finally, add the chilli and baste a few more times to fully coat the pineapple. Serve with coconut ice cream, coconut cake or madeleines.</p>
