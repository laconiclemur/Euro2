			<p class="rec-intro">Like new season’s lamb, kid (young goat) is a traditional Easter treat in the south of France and the milky white meat lends itself to Provençal flavours. My preferred way to cook kid is to poach it first, then grill it on a charcoal grill or barbecue. Otherwise, cook the kid in the oven and finish it under the grill to get a lovely crisp golden brown exterior.</p>

			<p class="ing-nu">1 leg of kid on the bone</p>

			<p class="ing-nu">1 onion, peeled and quartered</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">4 bay leaves</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 bunch of sarriette (summer savory) </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 garlic bulb</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 piment d’Espelette (whole dried chilli)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 bunch of parsley</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 tsp ground piment d’Espelette (chilli powder)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 tbsp acacia honey</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">60g green olives, pitted and chopped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">60g black olives, pitted and chopped</p>

			<p class="ing-nu">zest and juice of 1 lemon</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 spring onions, thinly sliced</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 sprigs of rosemary</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">salt</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">black pepper</p>

			<p class="body">Place the leg and shoulder in a pan, cover with cold water and season with salt. Add the onion, 2 of the bay leaves, the sarriette, 6 cloves of garlic, the dried chilli split in half and the parsley stalks, saving the leaves for later. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down and simmer the meat very gently for 10 minutes. Take the pan off the heat and leave to cool.</p>
			<p class="body">Chop the remaining garlic and bay leaves and put them in a bowl with the chopped parsley leaves, chilli powder, honey, green and black olives, olive oil, anchovies, lemon zest and juice, and spring onions. This should make a thick sauce, but add a little of the cooking liquid if you need to moisten it.</p>
			<p class="body">Blitz a third of the sauce to form a paste in a blender – I like to leave the rest chunky to serve with the meat. Remove the kid from the stock and pat it dry. Lightly score the skin with a thin-bladed, sharp knife and rub some of the paste on to the meat. Cover and repeat after an hour. </p>
			<p class="body">If using a charcoal grill or barbecue, it’s important to cook the meat slowly and gently. Dip the rosemary fronds into the remaining paste and use them to baste the meat regularly, until it is golden and crisp on the outside and succulent within. Over a gentle heat it should take no more than 45 minutes. If cooking in the oven, cook at 200°C/Fan 180°C/Gas 6 – the time will be about the same. </p>
			<p class="body">Serve with some roasted baby new potatoes and a few salad leaves. The sauce will be sufficient dressing. </p>
