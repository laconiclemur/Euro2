 zuppe</h2>
<h2 class="h2a">soup</h2>
<p class="parab1">We make very fine soup in Italy. I remember having soup as a child and being able to pinpoint every single ingredient used. It tasted nothing like the bland liquid you find in a tin these days.</p>
<p class="parab1">Every member of my family had a favourite soup. My uncle, the baker, who shared my passion for chestnuts, invented a chestnut soup. It was made from sun-dried chestnuts simmered in water with a single clove of garlic, olive oil, rosemary and lemon. Amazingly simple, yet so tasty.</p>
<p class="parab1">My sister, Phelomena, ate soup because she believed it would help her keep her figure. She was fervent in her soup making, and was rewarded with a remarkable balance of flavours that I haven’t tasted since. She made the most beautiful vegetable soup.</p>
<p class="parab1">My mother loved soup because it was a good way of using up leftovers: cheese that was too hard to grate, scraps of meat and vegetables, even pasta. Despite this, her soups always tasted magnificent. My father liked to make game soup, using up all his hunting bounty.</p>
<p class="parab1">We had soup all year round, including cold tomato soup in the hottest summer months. Over-ripe tomatoes were passed through a gadget to remove their skins, then oil, basil, lemon and cold vegetable stock were added to the pulp. The taste was phenomenal.</p>

 brodo di pollo</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">chicken broth</h3>
<p class="para1">Ask your butcher for a boiling chicken, if he has one. If not, use a roasting chicken. The flavour of home-made chicken broth is wonderful, and it is very simple to make: just put everything in a pan and forget about it for an hour and a half. To make it into a soup, either add some pasta for a typical light Italian <em>brodino</em>
 or, for a more substantial soup, add shredded chicken, chopped vegetables and pasta.</p>
<p class="para1">You can use the broth as stock in other soups, risotto, etc. The chicken can be eaten hot or cold as a main course, together with the vegetables, livened up with a little <a href="text00008.html#page_74">Salsa Verde</a>
 . The chicken is also delicious served cold, drizzled with a little extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 6–8</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">1.75kg/4lb chicken</p>
<p class="ingre">4 carrots, cut in half lengthways and then in half again</p>
<p class="ingre">3 onions, peeled but left whole</p>
<p class="ingre">6 celery stalks, including lots of leaves, squashed and roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">6 cherry tomatoes, squashed</p>
<p class="ingre">a bunch of parsley stalks, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">4 litres/7 pints water</p>
<p class="ingre1">salt</p>
<p class="para1">Place all the ingredients in a large saucepan and bring just to the boil. Reduce the heat, cover with a lid and simmer very gently for 1½ hours.</p>
<p class="para1">Remove the chicken and vegetables from the pan and strain the liquid through a fine sieve to give a clear broth. Alternatively, if you prefer, you can leave the little bits of vegetables and herbs floating in the broth. The broth will keep in the fridge for 5 days.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>Variation</strong>
 To make an Italian <em>brodino</em>
 , place some of the liquid in a smaller saucepan and bring to the boil, then add small dried pasta or small meat-filled <a href="text00006.html#page_34">agnolotti</a>
 . Reduce the heat slightly and simmer until the pasta is <em>al dente</em>
 . Serve immediately in individual soup bowls with some freshly grated Parmesan.</p>

 zuppa di piselli e menta fresca</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">pea and fresh mint soup</h3>
<p class="para1">As soon as spring arrived, we loved to make dishes with the season’s new produce, such as fresh peas and herbs. Although the days were hotter, the evenings were still cool, so to keep warm but still have that fresh spring flavour, we would often make a soup such as this one. Try to use fresh peas. It might be hard work to shell such a large quantity but it is well worth it in the end. If necessary you can use frozen peas, or a combination of both.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4–6</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">2 shallots, finely sliced</p>
<p class="ingre">50g/2oz pancetta, finely diced</p>
<p class="ingre">½ celery stalk, finely chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">500g/1lb 2oz fresh peas (shelled weight)</p>
<p class="ingre">1 small iceberg lettuce, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">1 large potato, peeled and cut into cubes</p>
<p class="ingre">1 litre/1¾ pints vegetable stock</p>
<p class="ingre">15 fresh mint leaves, finely chopped, plus a few sprigs of mint to serve</p>
<p class="ingre">extra virgin olive oil, for drizzling</p>
<p class="ingre">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingre">
<strong>for the crostini (optional):</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">a knob of butter</p>
<p class="ingre1">8–12 small slices of bread</p>
<p class="para1">Heat the olive oil in a saucepan, add the shallots, pancetta and celery and sweat gently for a few minutes. Add the peas and stir well, then add the lettuce, potato and stock. Stir well and season with salt and pepper (be careful when adding the salt, as pancetta is salty). Cover with a lid and simmer gently for 15 minutes, or until the peas are tender.</p>
<p class="para1">Remove from the heat and leave to cool slightly. Then pour into a blender or food processor and purée until smooth (in batches if necessary). Return the soup to the pan, add the chopped mint and heat through. Check the seasoning and adjust if necessary.</p>
<p class="para1">Meanwhile, make the crostini. Melt the butter in a frying pan, add the bread slices and fry until golden brown on each side.</p>
<p class="para1">Serve the soup drizzled with a little extra virgin olive oil, garnished with a sprig of mint and accompanied by the crostini.</p>

 zuppa di verdure invernali</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">mixed root vegetable soup</h3>
<p class="para1">The combination of root vegetables here makes a very tasty soup that is simple and economical to prepare and a soothing winter warmer. Because of its cooler climate, root vegetables are more common in the north of Italy – especially <em>scorzonera</em>
 (or black salsify). This is a strange-looking vegetable, long and thin with a black skin, which needs to be washed well and peeled. The interior is white and has a very pleasant, nutty flavour. If you can’t find scorzonera, replace it with salsify or extra quantities of any of the other root vegetables used. Parsnip is not an Italian vegetable, but I have included it in this recipe because it is readily available and I love the taste.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 6–8</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">6 tbsp olive oil</p>
<p class="ingre">2 garlic cloves, squashed (optional)</p>
<p class="ingre">1 small onion, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">1 leek, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">2 celery stalks, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">3 scorzonera (or salsify), peeled and roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">1 large parsnip, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">1 small celeriac, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">1 large potato, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">1 large carrot, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="ingre">2 litres/3½ pints vegetable stock</p>
<p class="ingre">salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="ingre1">croûtons and/or chopped fresh chives, to serve (optional)</p>
<p class="para1">Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan, add the garlic, if using, and sweat for 1 minute. Add the onion, leek and celery and stir well. Sweat for a few minutes, then add all the root vegetables and cook, stirring well, for a couple of minutes. Pour in the stock and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat, cover and simmer gently for 30 minutes, until the vegetables are tender.</p>
<p class="para1">Remove from the heat, cool slightly and then pour into a blender or food processor and purée until smooth (do this in batches if necessary). Return the soup to the saucepan and heat through. Check the seasoning and adjust if necessary. Serve immediately, garnished with some croûtons and/or chopped chives, if desired.</p>

 <span class="big">‘</span>
 Nearly all our soups contained a base of pulses, such as chickpeas or beans as these ingredients could be very cheaply bought from the local grocer’s. I remember sacks full of dried beans lined up against the wall of the shop. But these weren’t good enough for my mother. She didn’t trust their quality because she didn’t know where they came from. Instead, we bought fresh beans from local farmers in the summer and dried them in the sun. They were so delicious, I always thought they tasted as if the sun had kissed them. My mother used to store them in jars ready for winter use. I really looked forward to autumn and winter, just so I could open the jars and taste the beans again.</p>
<p class="paraba1">Everyone used pulses. In the alleyways of my village, you would invariably see people who looked as if they were panning for gold. In fact, they were sifting through dried beans to pick out any stones that had got mixed up with them in the drying process. You always knew they were going to have soup the next day.</p>
<p class="paraba1">When we wanted to use the dried beans, my mother would soak them overnight. The next day, she added fresh vegetables and maybe some dried meat and cooked them slowly in plenty of water. The taste was out of this world. Bean soup is still one of my favourites.<span class="big1">’</span>

 zuppa di borlotti</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">fresh borlotti bean soup</h3>
<p class="para1">If you can find fresh borlotti beans at the market or your greengrocer’s in spring, buy them; they taste delicious. The pod is the same shape as a broad bean but the colour is a pretty cream and mottled reddish purple.</p>
<p class="para1">If you can’t get fresh borlotti, soak the dried variety in water overnight, then drain them and follow the recipe below. Bear in mind you will need to double the cooking time.</p>

 zuppa di lenticchie</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">lentil soup</h3>
<p class="para1">When I was growing up, we had a wonderful array of pulses to choose from and lentils were a family favourite. We would often make this soup during autumn and winter – it was a tasty way of keeping warm as well as being a good source of protein. Served with some good bread, it is extremely filling and satisfying.</p>
<p class="para1">Lentils were sold from huge sacks and the shopkeeper would scoop out the amount you required. Later, at home, we had to sift through them as there were many small stones and impurities. I still sift through my lentils today (old habits die hard), although there is no need, as all shop-bought pulses are now carefully controlled.</p>
<p class="para1">If you keep this soup in the fridge for a day or two it will thicken. Either serve it as a stew or thin it down with a little stock.</p>
<p class="para">

 stracciatella al pomodoro</h3>
<h3 class="h3a">tomato soup with whisked egg whites</h3>
<p class="para1">
<em>Stracciatella</em>
 is usually a vegetable or chicken broth with a couple of eggs beaten in just before serving to make it more nourishing. In this recipe I have combined a simple tomato soup with whisked egg whites. Make sure you use good ripe tomatoes. To give it colour and body, I have also included some tomato passata. If you prefer not to use the egg whites, you can omit them and you will still have a delicious tomato soup.</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>serves 4–6</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingre">600g/1lb 5oz ripe tomatoes</p>
<p class="ingre">250g/9oz tomato passata</p>

<p class="ingre">750ml/1¼ pints vegetable stock</p>
<p class="ingre">a handful of fresh basil, plus a few leaves to garnish</p>
