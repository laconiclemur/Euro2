			<p class="rec-intro">The cardoon belongs to the artichoke and thistle family and grows wild in the Mediterranean region where it has been eaten since Greek and Roman times. It’s still a popular vegetable in parts of France – my wife’s family always grow cardoon and serve it stewed with tomato sauce. This particular recipe is a Lyonnaise speciality and can be served as a starter, an accompaniment or even as a main dish. Choose a cardoon that feels heavy and discard the first layer of stalks, which tend to be stringy and hollow.</p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 6</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 cardoon</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 tbsp plain flour</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">juice of 1 lemon</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">60g Gruyère cheese, grated</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">3 tbsp beef jus (see <a href="part0010_split_012.html#BEEF-jus" class="calibre4">here</a>)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">20g cooked truffle, thinly sliced </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">100g veal bone marrow, cut into 5mm slices </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 tbsp unsalted butter, for greasing dishes</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">salt</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">black pepper</p>

			<p class="body">Peel the stalks of the cardoon as you would celery, removing the strings and any discoloured parts. Cut into manageable pieces about 16cm in length and put them in a saucepan. Add cold water, running it through a fine sieve containing the flour. This makes what is called a <span class="italic">blanc</span> in French culinary parlance and helps to keep the cardoon white. Add the lemon juice and a little salt. </p>
			<p class="body">Bring the water to the boil, then cover with a piece of greaseproof paper and simmer for about an hour until the cardoon is tender. Drain and cut the cardoon into bite-sized diamond shapes. </p>
			<p class="body">Preheat the oven to 220°C/Fan 200°C/Gas 7. Arrange a neat layer of cardoon on the base of individual heatproof dishes or one large dish. Sprinkle with a little Gruyère layer followed by some beef jus, then repeat the layers twice more. Finish with some slices of truffle and bone marrow, then top with the rest of the Gruyère. Place in the hot oven for 6–7 minutes, then finish under the grill for a lovely brown top.</p>
