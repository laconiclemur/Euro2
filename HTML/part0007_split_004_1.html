  <h3 class="h3a">Chickpea soup</h3>

  <p class="chap-para">If you like chickpeas, you’ll love this rustic soup, flavoured with pork rind (you may need to ask for this in advance from your butcher or supermarket); you can remove the rind before serving if you prefer. Put all the ingredients in a large pot and leave it to bubble gently on the stove, just like farmers’ wives used to do in rural parts of Italy; when the family came home, there was always a warm bowl of soup ready and waiting. Remember to soak the chickpeas overnight the day before you make the soup.</p>

  <p class="ing">Serves 4</p>

  <p class="ing1">500g/1lb 2oz/2½ cups dried chickpeas, soaked in water overnight</p>

  <p class="ing1">500g/1lb 2oz pork rind, sliced into 12 x 3cm/4½ x 1-inch strips</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 onions, finely sliced</p>

  <p class="ing1">2 garlic cloves, left whole</p>

  <p class="ing1">4 large potatoes, peeled and left whole</p>

  <p class="ing1">1 tsp marjoram</p>

  <p class="ing1">10 basil leaves</p>

  <p class="ing1">5 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra to drizzle</p>

  <p class="ing2">freshly ground black pepper</p>

  <p class="para1">Drain and rinse the chickpeas. Put them in a large saucepan together with all the remaining ingredients and 1 litre/1¾ pints/4 cups water. Bring to the boil, partially cover with a lid and cook on a low heat for 3–4 hours, or until the chickpeas are tender (the potatoes will break up and make the soup thicker). Serve with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.</p>
