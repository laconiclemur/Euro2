<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">Fideos are short, thin strands of pasta that are usually cooked like Spanish rice—that is, cooked to absorb the flavors of the pan. Along the Mediterranean coast, you find a couple of different fideo dishes, including the famous seafood version that is prepared in a wide paella pan (facing page). This, though, is an inland version, made with thicker noodles and the pork-rich flavors of the countryside.</span></strong></p>

<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> Generously season the ribs with salt and pepper. In a cazuela, heavy casserole, large sauté pan, or deep skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the ribs and brown, turning from time to time, about 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low, add the onion, and cook until it begins to soften and turn pale, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and 2 tablespoons water and cook, stirring frequently, until the tomatoes are dark and pasty, 10 to 15 minutes. Add 1½&gt; cups/360 ml water, the pimentón, and the bay leaf and simmer uncovered over medium-low heat for 30 to 45 minutes, or until the pork is quite tender. Tip in a bit more water during cooking if needed to keep the sauce loose.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> Prepare a picada with the garlic, parsley, almonds, bread, and 1 tablespoon of the simmering liquid from the pan, following the directions on <a href="25-boxnote05.html#page_39">page 39</a>.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> Add 6 cups/1.4 L water to the cazuela, increase the heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil. Add the fideos and peas (if using) and cook uncovered until the fideos are al dente, 12 to 15 minutes (follow the time indicated on the pasta package). About halfway through cooking, stir in the picada, making sure that it completely dissolves into the sauce. Add in a touch more water if it threatens to dry out.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Remove from the heat, cover with paper towels, and let sit for 3 minutes or so before serving with the allioli on the side.</p>
<p class="tip"><span class="red"><span class="font2">NOTE:</span></span> Use No. 2 fideos or break or cut long, thin pasta, such as spaghettini, vermicelli, or tagliarini, into 1-inch/2.5-cm lengths.</p>
