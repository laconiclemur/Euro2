  <p class="nonindent"><span class="dropcaps"><img alt="" class="calibre11" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_007_r1.jpg" /></span> M<span class="small1">OLISE IS THE YOUNGEST OF THE ITALIAN REGIONS AND THE</span> second smallest, after Valle d’Aosta. It is not a big tourist destination, but I found the landscape of verdant plains rolling down from the Apennines to the Adriatic a most peaceful and pastoral setting. The region is sparsely populated, which lends to its unspoiled charm, and although the farmlands are rich, the economy of Molise throughout history has been meager, based on agriculture and the transporting <em class="calibre4">transumanza</em>, of shepherds and their flocks from Abruzzo into Puglia. Judging from my last visit, though, things seem to be changing. The agriculture is developing into food industries, and the marketplaces are vibrant, filled with local produce—fruits, legumes, and cheeses—and the most common crops of the region: wheat, broad beans, and potatoes. There is, as well, a clothing industry developing.</p>

  <p class="indent">Although the younger generations have moved away, seeking employment in the big cities, I have a sense that, with local and government incentives, the exodus will soon be diminishing, and the young will be returning to repopulate and set up shop in the land of their forefathers. Foreign tourism remains almost nonexistent, but many Italians spend their vacations in these medieval, almost deserted towns in the hills of Monti del Matese, above Campobasso, the capital.</p>

  <p class="indent">When I traveled with my friend Mario Piccozzi down from Roccaraso in Abruzzo in the summer of 2007, we stopped for lunch the first day near Bajano, and thereafter at other little trattorias, and it was evident that pasta, fresh and dry, was king in this small region. One of the simple and delicious recipes that I took home with me from that trip was gemelli with cauliflower, and as we headed toward the Adriatic, there was more pasta, particularly pasta with seafood, such as Braised Octopus with Spaghetti and simply prepared Spaghetti with Calamari, Scallops, and Shrimp, called <em class="calibre4">Spaghetti di Tornola</em>, named after the old tower of defense on the tip of the promontory of Termoli, the largest fishing port in Molise. Molise is strong on dry pasta, but in the home kitchens there is still much fresh pasta being made. Some of the extraordinary recipes I found during that trip are Fresh Cavatelli with Cauliflower, Fresh Cavatelli with Favas, and Fresh Cavatelli with Eggs and Bacon. What I found very interesting and unique were the names given to fresh pasta, like <em class="calibre4">malefante</em> (pasta cut 3 by 2 inches; see Fresh Pasta Strips with Beans and Bacon); or <em class="calibre4">taccozze</em> (1-by-1-inch squares; see Fresh <em class="calibre4">Taccozze</em> Pasta with Sea Bass). <a class="calibre8" id="page266"></a>Then there were the <em class="calibre4">-sagne</em> (lasagna, <em class="calibre4">lasagnelle</em>), tagliatelle, and <em class="calibre4">crejoli</em>, similar to the <em class="calibre4">maccheroni alla chitarra</em> in Abruzzo. The names were enough to intrigue me and send me back to my own kitchen to try them out.</p>

  <p class="indent">Whether in the sauces for pasta or in meats or fish preparations, in Molise the tomato dominates, as does the peperoncino. Inland, game, goat, lamb, pork, and beans are used in abundance. With the hilly terrain and rich pastures comes milk, and where there is milk there is cheese. The most notable cheese of Molise is the caciocavallo, and the best of this is from the town of Agnone. Made from cow’s milk, caciocavallo resembles provolone. Its name—<em class="calibre4">cacio</em> = cheese; <em class="calibre4">cavallo</em> = horse—refers to the way traveling shepherds, who made the cheese, would let it dry hanging across a pole on the back of the horses or mules as they traveled. Scamorza is also produced in Molise, a cheese similar to mozzarella that is left hanging to age, and ends up looking like a pear, which is sometimes smoked. Pecorino is also produced in the area, and all are part of the rustic and savory Molisano table.</p>

  <p class="indent">When cheese is made, there is always leftover whey, which is used to produce ricotta, and we had some simply delicious fried ricotta during that trip for which I share the recipe with you—<em class="calibre4">Ricotta Fritta</em>.</p>

  <p class="indent">I had never realized before how rich the upper Molise is in truffles, especially around the town of San Pietro Avellana. The black truffle—<em class="calibre4">Tuber aestivum</em>, or <em class="calibre4">scorzone</em>—and in season the very valuable white truffle, <em class="calibre4">Tuber magnatum pico</em>, abound. In specialty shops and in homes in Molise, you will find delectable cheeses, olive oils, and vegetables preserved in jars, infused with these truffles.</p>

  <p class="indent">And with these delicious truffles, one thinks of wine. There are only three DOC wines produced in Molise—the Biferno, Molise, and Pentro. Red, white, and rosé Biferno is made around Campobasso. Red, white, and rosé Pentro is made at Isernia. The Molise, in red and white varietals, as well as the Falanghina white varietal is made almost all over the region.</p>

  <p class="indent">There is also a tradition of silver- and goldsmithing in these parts, and I had heard of coppersmiths who still produced copper pots in artisanal fashion in Agnone. So up the winding road Mario and I climbed, only to come back down the hilly terrain, four hours later, happy, with the backseat full of copper pots, which, once I got to Rome, I had to figure how to pack and ship home. They arrived safely in New York, and now they are a shining reminder in my kitchen of that glorious trip to Molise.</p>

  <p class="nonindent1">Brodo di Pesce con Verdure <img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Makes about 4 quarts, serving 8 to 10</p>

  <p class="extract">I love all kinds of Italian fish soups, having sampled countless versions of <em class="calibre4">zuppa di pesce</em>, served with just enough tomatoey sauce to slurp up with a spoon, as well as <em class="calibre4">brodo di pesce</em>, a flavorful fish stock usually with nothing but rice. A new discovery for me, though, was this Molisano version of <em class="calibre4">brodo di pesce</em>, with chard and peppers floating between chunks of seafood in a savory broth. Served with grilled bread or a slab of grilled polenta, it is indeed a complete meal. Relish it with a glass of crispy white wine from the region’s distinctive Falanghina grape varietal, and you can taste Molise beckoning you.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour the olive oil into the soup pot and set it over medium heat.

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour in the crushed tomatoes, raise the heat a bit, and cook, stirring, until the tomatoes have dried out, about 3 to 4 minutes. Pour in the water and the remaining tablespoon salt, stir well, cover the pot, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Adjust the heat to maintain a gentle boil, and cook covered for an hour; then stir in the Swiss-chard shreds. Return the broth to a steady simmer, and cook uncovered for 45 minutes, or until the chard is very tender and the broth has reduced to 4 quarts.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To finish the soup: Add the chunks of monkfish to the simmering broth, cover, and cook for 5 minutes. Drop in the scallops, stir, and simmer for 7 minutes more. Add the shrimp, return the broth to a bubbling simmer, and cook for a minute or two, just until the shrimp are cooked through. Serve immediately in warm shallow soup bowls.</p>

  <p class="extract">Life in the hilly inland of Molise was for centuries a pastoral existence, and the traditional staples of the pastoral table are still essential elements in cooking <em class="calibre4">alla Molisana.</em> Ricotta, a nutritious and always available by-product of cheesemaking, thus appears on the table in many forms, such as gnocchi, with pastas and vegetables, and in soups—or eaten just plain, with bread. Here’s one of the most delicious ways that ricotta can be enjoyed: drained, shaped in small pieces, breaded, and fried, <em class="calibre4">ricotta fritta</em> gains new dimensions of texture and flavor. Serve these fried ricotta morsels as a savory appetizer or main course, in a puddle of tomato sauce or on top of braised vegetables. On the other hand, if you top them with some poached peaches or peach preserve or fruit jam with a dollop of whipped cream, you have a glorious dessert.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Put the drained ricotta in a bowl. With the ice-cream scoop or other implement, scoop out tablespoon-sized balls of ricotta, and set them on a parchment-lined tray or sheet pan (you should have about twenty-four ricotta balls total). Set the tray in the freezer, and chill the balls until firm, about 30 minutes.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Spread the flour on a small plate, and the bread crumbs on a large plate. Whisk the eggs with a pinch of salt in a wide, shallow bowl. Dredge the balls in the flour, and gently flatten them into thick patties. Coat the patties in egg, then dredge them until well coated in the bread crumbs, but not heavily so. Return the breaded patties to the parchment-lined tray.</p>

The oil is ready when the tip of a patty sizzles on contact. Drop the patties into the skillet in batches, so they are not crowded, and fry for 1 to 2 minutes on each side, until golden brown and crispy. Lift them from the skillet with a slotted spatula, and drain briefly on paper towels.</p>

    <p class="textbox1">With so much pasta, I decided this would be a good place to share with you some information about the history, the making, and the cooking of pasta.</p>

    <p class="textbox2">Evidence has been found that the Chinese were eating pasta over four thousand years ago, but, as much as it is said that Marco Polo brought pasta from China, it seems that pasta came to Italy from the Arab world into Sicily. There is reference to a homogeneous mixture of water and flour around the second century, by the Greek physician Galen. The Jerusalem Talmud records a kind of boiled dough that was eaten in Palestine from the fifth to the third century <span class="small1">B.C.</span> And in a dictionary compiled by Isho bar Ali in the ninth century in Syria, he defines <em class="calibre4">itriyya</em> as strings made of semolina, dried, and then cooked. It seems that the nomadic Arab tribes made sheets of dough, dried them in the sun, and packed them for travel. When they reached the new camp, they would drop the dried pasta in boiling water, perhaps with other condiments, and the meal was ready. And when they hopped over and occupied Sicily, this tradition most likely came with them and traveled up the peninsula.</p>

    <p class="textbox2">There is also a reference in Horace’s work in the first century <span class="small1">B.C.</span> to <em class="calibre4">laganum</em>, a fine sheet of dough that was cooked, which the Romans enjoyed. These are all speculations. References to pasta in Italy as we know it today did not appear until the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.</p>

    <p class="textbox2">The important elements in good dry-pasta-making are four: the quality of the semolina, its taste, and its gluten content, and the quality of the water. Why is durum wheat preferable? Because it is a hard wheat and has almost double the gluten that regular soft white flour does. Gluten is a form of protein, giving the pasta a resilient texture when cooked. Since Molise and Abruzzo are situated at the foot of the Apennines, the waters with which they make the dry pasta are pristine and flavorful. What is also important is that the dough be kneaded properly to build the glutens, and mixed at low temperatures to retain resiliency and consistency, so the pasta remains <em class="calibre4">al dente</em> when cooked. Once the dough is developed, it is drawn through bronze cutters and formed into shapes. The pasta is then dried in a long, slow process, to ensure uniformity of texture and to retain the maximum flavors of the durum wheat, which when cooked blossoms into a gentle aroma.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Cavatelli are a short, hollow form of fresh pasta that should definitely be part of your repertoire of homemade pasta varieties. Of all the shapes of fresh pasta that I share with you, this is one of the simplest to create, because all you need is your fingers. It is a shape that cooks well and remains <em class="calibre4">al dente</em>, a gutsy pasta that is great to eat, with lots of texture. Cavatelli are also fun to make—even little ones can do it—and easy to freeze for future meals.</p>

  <p class="indent">Most of all, I like cavatelli because they go so well with all kinds of sauces—in particular, zesty vegetable sauces. In the coming pages, I’ll first tell you how to make cavatelli, and then present four dressed cavatelli dishes, typical of the many you will find in Molise. Of course, the sauces in these recipes are delicious with other pastas; in place of fresh cavatelli, you can substitute a pound of dried cavatelli, gemelli, short fusilli, <em class="calibre4">strozzapreti</em>, rotini, and other short dried pastas with good results. (And keep in mind that pastas made with whole wheat, barley, buckwheat, and other flours will add interesting flavor, nutritional value, and complexity to your pasta dishes.)</p>

    <p class="nonindent"><span class="small">RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT:</span> A food processor fitted with a steel blade</p>
  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Put the flour in the bowl of the food processor, and process for a few seconds, to aerate. With the food processor running, pour in the water through the feed tube. Process for about 30 seconds, until a dough forms and gathers on the blade. If the dough does not gather on the blade or process easily, it is too wet or dry. Feel the dough, then work in more flour or cold water, in small amounts, using the processor or kneading by hand.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Turn the dough out on a lightly floured surface, and knead by hand for a minute, until it’s smooth, soft, and stretchy. Press it into a disk, wrap well in plastic wrap, and let rest at room temperature for at least ½ hour. (You can refrigerate the dough for up to a day, or freeze for a month or more. Defrost in the refrigerator, and return to room temperature before rolling.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To form the cavatelli, lightly flour your work surface. Pinch off golf-ball-sized pieces of dough, and roll them out under your palms into long ropes about the thickness of a pencil. Cut the ropes into 1-inch segments or short cylinders; keep pieces in front of you, horizontally (left to right). Flour your hands, especially the tips of the three middle fingers of your right hand unless you are left-handed. Hold these fingertips tightly together, and press them into one of the cut segments, and gently roll toward you.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> As your fingertips make indentations in the segment, roll it toward you more so the dough both lengthens and curls around the fingertips. As the curl is complete, lift your fingers up quickly, so the dough segment drops off. It should now resemble a short concave shell—or a hollowed-out boat or canoe—with the impression of your fingers in the hollows and along the edges.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Adjust the pressure of your fingers as needed—if the dough cylinders are not lengthening and forming a hollow, press harder. If they’re just flattening beneath your fingers, press a bit more gently. Once you get up to speed, you should be able to roll the cavatelli with a quick downward flick of your fingertips.</p>

  <p class="extract">In this dish, the cavatelli are dressed with a sauce of fresh fava beans, always a great treat in season. Another special ingredient here is <em class="calibre4">ricotta salata</em>, or salted ricotta, a marvelous product made from fresh sheep’s-milk ricotta that is pressed, dried, and aged for a few months, until fairly firm, retaining the mild, milky taste of fresh ricotta yet with more complexity. It is a traditional accompaniment to fresh favas—a delicious pairing you will taste here—but <em class="calibre4">ricotta salata</em> is a great final seasoning on many other pastas as well. As I instruct in this recipe, <em class="calibre4">ricotta salata</em> is best grated on top of the pasta just before you serve it. Put a chunk of it on the table with the grater, and let people shower on more <em class="calibre4">ricotta salata</em> as they dig deeper into their bowls.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To blanch the favas: Fill the pasta pot with 4 quarts water, and heat to a boil. Split open the fava pods, and collect the beans, still covered with a thick skin. When the water is boiling, drop in the favas, and blanch them for 2 minutes, just until they turn green and the skin has loosened. Lift out the beans with a wire strainer, and drop them into a bowl of ice water, to set the color. When they’re chilled, drain the beans and peel off the skins; you should have about 3 cups of fully peeled favas. Now pour at least 2 more quarts of water and 1 tablespoon salt into the hot blanching water, and heat again to the boil, to cook the cavatelli.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the sauce: Pour the olive oil into the skillet, and set it over medium heat. Stir in the onion, garlic, and peperoncino. Cook until the onion is translucent, about 3 to 4 minutes. Ladle a cup or so of the pasta cooking water into the skillet, and simmer until the onion begins to soften, about 2 to 3 minutes. Spill in the favas, and season with the salt, ladle in another 3 cups of pasta water, and bring to a steady simmer. Cook, uncovered, for 15 to 20 minutes, until the favas are very tender and beginning to break down and thicken the sauce. Keep the sauce barely simmering while you cook the pasta.</p>

  <p class="extract">In times past in poor regions like Molise, when meat was scarce, eggs were an available and affordable source of protein. A dish of pasta dressed with eggs combined the nutrients of two staple foods for a meal that was naturally nutritious and sustaining. I love these pastas sauced with eggs, and tasty versions can be found all over Italy, especially in Abruzzo, Molise, and Lazio (Rome), where the most famous dish of this type, <em class="calibre4">spaghetti alla carbonara</em>, originated. This Molisano version is particularly appealing, with cavatelli, scrambled eggs, and bacon, and with grated Fontina Val d’Aosta tossed in at the end—a bit out of region, but absolutely delicious here. In Molise they would use grated pecorino, of course, and it is lovely that way, too.</p>

  <p class="nonindent"><em class="calibre4">Malefante</em> and <em class="calibre4">taccozze</em> are two of the many interesting forms of fresh pasta I found in Molise. Both are simple flat shapes, cut from the same plain pasta dough: <em class="calibre4">malefante</em> are short rectangular strips, and <em class="calibre4">taccozze</em> are small diamonds. I give you the formula for the dough and instructions for cutting the shapes in the first recipe below.</p>

  <p class="indent">The following two recipes are for finished pastas with quite different flavors: <em class="calibre4">Malefante</em> are dressed in a loose sauce of cannellini (and their cooking liquid) with lots of crisp bacon pieces. The <em class="calibre4">taccozze</em> come in a souplike fish stew, with chunks of sea-bass fillet and bits of fresh tomato. In fact, the little pasta diamonds are cooked right in the sauce, not in a separate pot of water.</p>

  <p class="indent">The soupy consistency of both of these dishes, compared with typical Italian pastas, is a reflection of custom and tradition but practicality, too. Given their flat and rather wide surfaces, both <em class="calibre4">malefante</em> and <em class="calibre4">taccozze</em> have a tendency to stick together. With sauces of the usual density, it would be difficult to keep the pieces apart and coat them on both sides. The greater amount of liquid in the recipes here makes it possible to separate the pasta pieces as you tumble them with the sauce.</p>

  <p class="indent">Though I generally believe that pasta dishes should not have a wet or soupy quality, I love these two. Indeed, the bean-and-bacon sauce for the <em class="calibre4">malefante</em> can easily cook to conventionally thick density, depending on how much bean cooking liquid you start with. In most instances, you will need to add water to really soften the beans and keep the sauce loose enough to coat the pasta. But I have found that if I add more water than necessary, creating a sauce that has to be slurped, I get a distinctly different dish that I actually prefer.</p>

  <p class="indent">In addition to adjusting the sauce consistency to your taste, there are many ways to vary the texture of the pasta dough or how you roll it. You might add eggs to the dough (the basic recipe calls only for water), or use a combination of whole-wheat and white flour. And if you use finely ground durum wheat flour in place of all-purpose flour, the pasta will have more of the taste you would find in Molise. Finally, you can give your <em class="calibre4">malefante</em> and <em class="calibre4">taccozze</em> a chewy, full mouth-feel simply by leaving the dough a little thicker when you roll it out. I found countless such variations in pasta during my travels in Molise and always appreciate these creative distinctions.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the pasta dough: Put the flour in the bowl of the food processor, and process for a few seconds to aerate. With the food processor running, pour in the water through the feed tube. Process for about 30 seconds, until a dough forms and gathers on the blade. If the dough does not gather on the blade or process easily, it is too wet or dry. Feel the dough, then work in more flour or ice water, in small amounts, using the processor or kneading by hand.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Turn the dough out on a lightly floured surface, and knead by hand for a minute, until it’s smooth, soft, and stretchy. Press it into a disk, wrap well in plastic wrap, and let rest at room temperature for at least ½ hour. (You can refrigerate the dough for up to a day, or freeze for a month or more. Defrost in the refrigerator and return to room temperature before rolling.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To roll out the dough with a pasta machine: Cut the dough in six equal pieces. Keeping them lightly floured, roll the pieces at progressively thinner settings, gradually stretching them into strips about 2 feet long and as wide as your machine allows, usually about 5 inches. For easier handling, cut each strip in half crosswise, so you have twelve strips about a foot long. Lay them flat on a lightly floured surface, and keep covered with towels.</p>

  <p class="extract">For me, there’s no better way to dress spaghetti than with a fresh seafood sauce. And this sauce, from the old fishing port of Termoli in Molise, is as simple and delicious as any. In the restaurants by the docks in Termoli (near the old citadel called Tornola), just-caught seafood is served in a <em class="calibre4">brodetto.</em> You eat the seafood, and then the kitchen will toss spaghetti into the sauce you’ve left in your bowl. In my version of <em class="calibre4">spaghetti di Tornola</em>, the calamari, scallops, and shrimp are part of the pasta dressing, but you can eat the <em class="calibre4">brodetto</em> in separate courses, Termoli-style, if you like. In summer, I use my mother’s home-grown, sun-ripened cherry tomatoes to make an exceptional sauce, but in winter, a couple of cups of canned plum tomatoes make a fine substitute.</p>

  <p class="extract">I love this simple method for cooking whole octopus so it explodes with flavor. You just put it in a heavy pan and let it cook very slowly (with only olive oil, sliced onions, and olives to season it) for a couple of hours. As it cooks, it releases all of its natural, tasty water, which serves as a braising liquid. Though the meat loses some volume, its flavor is retained in the liquid, which naturally cooks into a great dressing for spaghetti or other pasta. In this recipe, the meat is cut into chunks that are tossed with the spaghetti and cooking juices. For a special occasion, though, you can serve the whole octopus, uncut (or two smaller octopuses, as called for here). If you dress the spaghetti with the juices alone and set the octopus on top, with the tentacles curling around and under, it makes a beautiful presentation.</p>

  <p class="indent">You can also serve this delectable cephalopod—either whole or cut into pieces—over freshly cooked soft polenta or slabs of grilled polenta. And any leftover octopus meat or sauce can be incorporated into a terrific risotto; with so much flavor in them, just a small amount of leftovers is all you’ll need to make a great risotto for two.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour 6 tablespoons of the olive oil into the saucepan, and set it over low heat. Scatter the onion slices over the bottom of the pan, and lay the octopuses on top. Scatter the olives over the octopuses, cover the pan, and let the octopuses heat slowly, releasing their liquid, and starting to cook in it. After an hour or so, uncover the pan and check to see that there is plenty of octopus liquid in the pan. If it seems dry, add 1 cup of water at a time. This recipe should yield 2 cups of sauce when the octopus is done.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Continue the covered slow cooking for another hour, until the octopuses are very tender. Start testing for doneness after 1¾ hours: stick the tines of a fork in the thickest part of each octopus; when the fork slides out easily, the meat is done.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Remove the octopuses from the pot, and let them cool slightly. To make a meaty octopus sauce, cut both octopuses into ¾-inch chunks, skin and all (or you can leave the octopuses whole for serving). Measure the liquid remaining in the saucepan. Again, you should have about 2 cups total. If the volume is greater, return the juices to the saucepan and boil to reduce it.

  <p class="indent">Of course, you don’t have to serve it all for the same meal. Use half the sauce to dress a pound of pasta, freeze the rest, and you have a future meal all ready to go.

I bet you’ll have enough sauce with meaty morsels for a lasagna or other baked pasta—yet another meal from that one big braising pan.</p>

  <div class="block1">
    <p class="nonindent"><span class="small">RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT:</span> A heavy saucepan, such as an enameled cast-iron French oven, 8-quart capacity, with a cover; a large pasta-cooking pot; a heavy-bottomed skillet or sauté pan, 12-inch diameter or larger</p>
  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour the olive oil into the big saucepan, and set it over medium heat. Scatter in the sliced garlic, let it sizzle and start to color for a couple of minutes, stir in the chopped onions, rosemary, and bay leaf, and season with 1 teaspoon of the salt. Cook for 7 or 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened and translucent.</p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page288"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Season the pork and veal chop all over with 1½ teaspoons salt. Push the onions to one side of the pot, and lay the meat pieces in the pan bottom. Brown the meats slowly, turning frequently so all sides are evenly colored, about 10 minutes in all. When the meats are nicely browned, sprinkle the peperoncino in the pan bottom to toast for a minute, then stir the onions back into the center of the pot, scraping up the meat juices.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Turn up the heat, pour in the red wine, bring to a boil, and cook until almost completely evaporated. Pour in the crushed tomatoes, slosh out the cans with 4 cups of cold water, and add that as well. Stir in the remaining teaspoon of salt. Cover the pan, and bring the sauce to a boil over high heat, then adjust the flame to keep a gentle, steady bubbling. Cook covered for an hour, stirring and turning the meat pieces over occasionally, then set the cover ajar to allow the sauce to reduce gradually as it bubbles away. Cook another hour, until the pork and veal are just tender, then drop in the sausages and continue simmering for another 45 minutes to an hour.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> After nearly 3 hours of total braising, the meats should be extremely tender and readily broken apart; the sauce should be thick and flavorful. Check the concentration of the sauce during the long cooking: If it seems too thin, remove the cover altogether. If it’s reducing too fast, cover the pan tightly and lower heat.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> If you’ll be serving the meats and dressing pasta right away, remove the meat to a warm platter, take out a couple of cups of sauce for the meat, and leave the rest in the big saucepan to dress pasta (about 8 cups sauce for 2 pounds rigatoni, or 4 cups sauce for 1 pound). If you’ll be serving the meat and sauce later, leave them both in the saucepan to cool; refrigerate, or freeze for longer keeping.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To cook and dress rigatoni with sauce: fill the pasta pot with plenty of well-salted water (at least 6 quarts water with a tablespoon salt for 1 pound of rigatoni; 8 quarts and 1½ tablespoons salt for 2 pounds), and heat to a rolling boil. Stir in the rigatoni, return the water to a boil, and cook until the pasta is just <em class="calibre4">al dente.</em></p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Meanwhile, if you’re using the sauce right away, bring it back to a simmer in the big saucepan or a big skillet, preferably 14 inches in diameter. If the sauce has cooled and thickened, loosen it with some of the pasta cooking water.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Lift the rigatoni out of the pot, drain briefly, and drop them into the sauce. Toss well for a minute or so, over low heat, until the rigatoni are nicely coated and perfectly <em class="calibre4">al dente.</em> Turn off the heat, sprinkle on the grated cheese, and toss again; if you like, drizzle on more olive oil, and toss that in as well. Serve the pasta right away, transferring it to a large warm bowl to serve family-style, or heaping it in individual warm pasta bowls. Serve immediately, passing more cheese at the table.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To serve the meat as a <em class="calibre4">secondo</em> or main course: Slice the pork and veal. Pour the reserved sauce in a skillet, lay in the slices and sausages, and place over low heat until the meat is heated through. Serve on a warmed platter with some of the sauce, passing the rest.</p>
