    <p class="nonindent1_break"><a id="page113"/><span class="C_COTX"><span class="dk_blue">After a day of fishing</span></span> that begins at 3:00 a.m. and concludes at around 4:00 p.m., fishing-boat captain <a id="ind560a"/>Siggi Henningsson’s day is not over yet. He lives on <a id="ind276a"/>Grímsey Island; the Arctic Circle passes through this three-mile-wide speck of land at the top of the world and the thrashing wind has shaped the terrain into watermelon-size mounds of earth. There is an urgency to Siggi’s work as he spryly navigates a summer’s day that is precious when you live on the Arctic Circle. In a few short months, the sun will set for the last time, the bitter cold will set in, the fishing will conclude for the season, and the fewer than ninety residents of Grímsey will wait out the darkness and the cold in lonely isolation.</p>
<p class="extract">But Siggi does not see his life on Grímsey as isolated. There are relationships to foster with the other residents of the island, a motley family of longtime inhabitants and newcomers hoping to settle down in one of the most remote spots on earth. After cleaning up from fishing, Siggi meets with his brother and nephews on the edge of a cliff. There he dons a climbing suit, harness, and helmet, loops one end of a rope through the harness, and then attaches the rope to the back of a tractor. He does not flinch as he hops over the side of the cliff with a <a id="ind200a"/>collecting bag, waving good-bye to his family, and descending to collect seabird eggs. It’s something he has been doing since he was a small boy. It is dangerous work, but it’s just another afternoon well spent for Siggi, who collects hundreds of eggs that he then delivers to a collective refrigerator that anyone on the island can use.</p>
<p class="extract">He keeps three eggs for himself for a dinner later that night. It will be a classic island meal of boiled eggs, whale steak, seabird breasts, and a salad covered in a béchamel sauce that Gunnar will prepare for the feast. The chef and the fisherman have become close friends over the years. Gunnar says he visits Grímsey to clear his head and get away from it all. The orderly, ambitious life that Siggi leads inspires him and recharges him, and his optimism is infectious.</p>
<p class="extract">Later that night, after the dishes have been done, the hour is late and another 3:00 a.m. wake-up call looms, but Siggi has no plans to sleep. He has just purchased a new Jet Ski and invites his dinner guests to go for a ride in the marina. He plays like a kid in the frigid waters, and the next day when we are out fishing with him, he tells us that he used to travel back and forth between Grímsey and <a id="ind11a"/>Akureyri, the largest town in northern Iceland. We mention that it is a forty-mile trip over a sea so choppy that the ferries sometimes suspend service because of the danger—that a man and his Jet Ski are no match for an ocean ready to swallow them up in its icy waves. He just grins his fresh, knowing grin and says, “You have to take chances in life. You have to really live it, feel it, and challenge yourself. Otherwise, what’s the point?”</p>
<h2 class="A2" id="c05-s31"><a id="page114"/><span class="dk_blue">A Conversation with Seabird Egg Collector Siggi Henningsson</span></h2>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> What do you enjoy most about living on Grímsey?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">I like how remote it is. I think because of the isolation, people here are very supportive of one another and we are a really tight-knit community. We have to be to get through the long winters. We need to take care of one another in ways that many communities do not but perhaps should. I live away from the town, though, because there are a few too many people there for me. I like being away from it all, and while you might say just being on the island is being away from it all, I like having even more space than most folks who live here.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> You are not a native of Grímsey. When did you move here?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">I was around ten when my family moved here from <a id="ind311a"/>Hjalteyri, a town in western Iceland. We are a family of fishermen, and <a id="ind249a"/>fishing had decreased in our region, so we moved farther north where the fish were still abundant. Today, I live here with my wife and young son. My two brothers also live on the island with their families, and my parents are here too. I like having everyone nearby.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Seabird egg collecting is a hobby of yours but fishing is your career. What do you enjoy most about fishing?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">I like the challenge and the hard work. I also like being out on the water where it’s quiet and you can clear your head to the sound of nothing but the wind, birds, and water. But then there is a rush when the fish start coming in, and it is very rewarding to bring home a good catch. I feel connected out here to my family, who were fishermen as far back as anyone can remember. It makes me feel close to them, and I like knowing that I am carrying on a legacy.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> When did you start <a id="ind201a"/>collecting seabird eggs?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">I’ve done it ever since I moved to the island. My brother and uncle always made me go, and at first I didn’t like it. But then I developed a love for it. Few people collect them on the island any longer, and it’s a tradition that will die out unless we continue to do it. It’s a part of who we are here on Grímsey, and it’s important to maintain it. If we don’t, nothing will be left but the stories of the people who used to collect eggs, and the knowledge of how to do it will have been forgotten. It must be passed down from generation to generation to keep it alive.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> <a id="page115"/>What is the most challenging part of collecting the eggs?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">The hardest part of collecting eggs is not to get the rope stuck between the rocks. If you’re not careful, the rocks will wear it down and it will break. We are hundreds of feet above the sea, and a fall from that height into the water will surely kill you. Falling rocks are another danger. It’s why we wear helmets. We have lost men in recent years to egg collecting, but it is part of life here on the island and a risk that some are willing to take. Life on Grímsey can be dangerous, and with fewer than ninety people living here, losing one is a tremendous loss. Last winter, one of my friends died when he was walking on the top of one of the cliffs bringing in his sheep. He fell on the ice and shot out into the sea on an ice chute that had formed. We never found him.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> What are the required tools for egg collecting?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">You must always wear a helmet, a harness, and a suit for protection. There is the rope, of course, and the tractor is required for letting the rope down and pulling it back up the cliff. We used to do this without the use of a tractor and a rope by climbing up the cliff sides from a boat, but too many men died that way. I use a stick to collect the eggs once I’m near them, and I put them in a bag attached to my harness. The eggs are very durable, with a much thicker shell than a chicken egg, so they do not break during the collection process. They are also cone-shaped, thanks to clever mother nature, to prevent them from rolling off the cliffside. We use radios to communicate, which is helpful.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> When does the season begin?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">We start collecting eggs on around May 10. The birds will continue to lay eggs until a bird hatches, and in this way we are not affecting the population by taking a few of their eggs. The birds lay the eggs directly on the cliff sides rather than build nests. We go out to collect about three times per season and then we stop. We take the eggs to a collective cooler in the center of town for anyone to eat when they have a craving for one. We also sell them to the one restaurant in town. Tourists seem to like eating them. It’s something different for them—something they have never experienced before.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> How do you like to prepare your seabird eggs?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">I eat only about five eggs per season, and I prepare them by boiling them until they are hard, peeling them, and sprinkling them with a little salt and sugar. It’s not complicated. I find in life that the simple way is usually the best way.</p>

<div class="Essays" id="c05-eass8">
<p class="Essays_header"><a id="page117"/><span class="dk_blue">PUFFIN</span></p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">Seabirds, such as the puffin, the guillemot, and the razorbill, are plentiful in Iceland, and although it is not as common as it once was to find their eggs and meat on the nation’s table, Icelanders still have a fondness for them, with many restaurant menus featuring items such as smoked puffin and guillemot breasts. Iceland has one of the most plentiful puffin populations in the world, at an estimated nine million birds. Like the razorbill and guillemot, they nest in cliffside nooks and crannies high above the pounding sea.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent"><a id="ind481a"/>Puffins were once most common in the <a id="ind660a"/>Westman (Vestmannaeyjar) Islands in southern Iceland, but as a result of global warming, they are migrating farther north to places like the remote <a id="ind653a"/>Westfjords in the northwest and to Grímsey Island on the Arctic Circle, where their meat is often smoked to sustain the small island population through the harsh winters.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">The birds are caught using what looks like a giant butterfly net, and in many parts of Iceland where they nest, locals host hunting parties in midsummer, at which hundreds of birds are caught in just a few days. Local cooks prize this small bird with its Technicolor beak not only for its tender breast but also for its heart and liver.</p>

<div class="headnote">This recipe is one of those dishes that Gunnar frequently surprises his guests at Dill with when they don’t expect much from a bowl of cauliflower, butter, and an egg. And then they taste it and the bowl is emptied in a flash, because the combination of the creamy egg, the crunchy raw cauliflower, and the caramelized sweetness of the burned butter delivers much more flavor and texture than they’re expecting in such an unfussy dish. When seabird eggs are in season, Gunnar requests them for this recipe, always showing his guests the large cone-shaped turquoise eggs speckled with black before he prepares them. A standard chicken egg is a good substitute, but should you ever find yourself with a seabird egg in your kitchen, be sure to use it in this easy but magnificent recipe.</div>
<div class="ingredient">

<p class="IL_item"><strong>3 tablespoons <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c05_r1.htm#c05-eass9">burned butter</a></strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>½ cup (10 g) tapioca maltodextrin (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c05_r1.htm#c05-note22">see notes</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Salt</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>4 eggs</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>2 to 3 cauliflower stalks, thinly sliced on a mandoline (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03-note13">see notes</a>)</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">To make the cauliflower puree, preheat an immersion circulator (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c05_r1.htm#c05-note22">see notes</a>) to 181°F (83°C). Place the cauliflower, milk, and cream in a vacuum bag and seal on the highest setting. Cook in the circulator for about 20 minutes, until the cauliflower is tender. Test if the cauliflower is done by pinching it through the bag. If it is tender and easily breaks apart, it is ready. If it still feels woody and tough, it requires an extra 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the bag from the circulator and drain the contents of the bag, reserving the liquid and cauliflower separately.</div>
<div class="method">Transfer the cauliflower to a blender, add the butter, and process on high speed, adding the reserved liquid as necessary to form a smooth puree. Season with salt and vinegar.</div>
<div class="method">To make the burned butter powder, in a bowl, vigorously whisk together the butter and tapioca maltodextrin for about 20 seconds, until a fine powder forms. Season with salt.</div>
<div class="method">To make the eggs, prepare an ice bath. Bring a saucepan of water to a vigorous boil. Carefully lower 1 egg into the water and cook at a vigorous boil for 3½ minutes. Transfer the egg to the ice bath and leave until well chilled. Repeat this process with the remaining eggs, bringing the water up to a boil each time before adding the next egg. Remove each egg from the ice bath and immediately crack it lightly on all sides on a flat surface. Carefully peel away the shell, then remove the egg white and reserve for another use. <a id="page119"/>Carefully place the egg yolk in the bottom of a bowl that will be used for serving. The yolk will be hot, so use caution when handling it. Repeat with the remaining eggs.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, spoon the puree around the yolk, arrange a wispy cloud of raw cauliflower on top, and sprinkle with the <a id="ind95a"/>burned butter powder.</div>
<div class="note" id="c05-note22">
<p class="note_head"><span class="dk_blue"><strong>NOTES</strong></span></p>

<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">2. An alternative to using an immersion circulator is to steam the cauliflower until tender, then combine the milk and cream in a small saucepan, bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat, add the cauliflower, and cook until warmed through.

<div class="Essays" id="c05-eass9">
<p class="Essays_header"><span class="dk_blue">BURNED BUTTER</span></p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">Burned butter is not really burned. Instead, it is deeply caramelized butter that adds a toasty sweetness to whatever it is cooked with or drizzled over. To make it, melt butter in a pan over medium heat and cook until it becomes a rich chestnut brown, stirring every once in a while to prevent scorching. Do not let it go past this color or it will indeed taste burned.</p>

<div class="headnote1">Gunnar’s family owns a home in eastern Iceland near the town of <a id="ind202a"/>Egilsstadir that has been in the extended family for generations. He stays there with his wife and children whenever they venture east. Its cozy bedrooms invite the weary traveler to rest deeply and awaken to surround the large wooden dining room table for a breakfast feast.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent0">During the research for this book, we arrived at the house late enough to see the Northern Lights streaking across the sky. We were ravenous and there was little to eat, so Gunnar told us to put on our shoes, then he pulled his truck up to the door and drove us to the expansive garden on the edge of the property, where we did a little midnight potato picking in our pajamas. We ate the potatoes for dinner that night and also the next morning, when he prepared this recipe for an on-the-go breakfast in plastic cups, picking angelica from just outside the door to flavor the mayonnaise that he dolloped on top of the boiled potatoes.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent">When in season, Gunnar uses seabird eggs in the mayonnaise for their bright golden color and decidedly eggy flavor. In this recipe, the potatoes and mayonnaise are gussied up with other elements, but should you find yourself in need of comfort food or of a quick and easy snack for your kids, head straight for the potato-mayonnaise combination and omit the rest.</div>

<div class="method">To make the shallot powder, prepare an ice bath. Bring a small saucepan of salted water to a boil over high heat, add the shallots, and blanch for a few seconds. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the petals to the ice bath, immersing them until chilled. Drain, pat dry with paper towels, and transfer to a small heatproof glass jar.</div>
<div class="method"><a id="page123"/>Combine the vinegar, water, and sugar in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Pour the hot liquid over the shallots, immersing them. Let cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate for 24 hours.</div>
<div class="method">Preheat a dehydrator to the highest setting or preheat an oven to its lowest setting. If using an oven, line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Drain the shallots, pat dry with paper towels, and arrange on a dehydrator tray or on the prepared baking sheet. Dehydrate the shallots, flipping them over at the halfway point, for about 12 hours, until they are deep golden brown. Let cool to room temperature, then grind to a coarse powder in a spice grinder. The powder willl keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</div>
<div class="method">To make the cream cheese foam, in a bowl, whisk together the cream cheese, milk, and xanthan gum until smooth, free of lumps, pourable, and resembling melted ice cream. (This can also be done in a stand mixer fitted with the whip attachment.) Season with vinegar and salt. Transfer to a siphon and charge the siphon with 2 nitrous oxide (NO<sub class="frac">2</sub>) chargers according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Shake the siphon vigorously and refrigerate until chilled (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c05_r1.htm#c05-note23">see notes</a>).</div>
<div class="method">To make the potatoes, boil the potatoes in salted water to cover for 12 to 15 minutes, until tender. Drain the potatoes, let cool just until they can be handled, then cut the larger potatoes in half crosswise. In a bowl, combine the potatoes and butter and stir gently to coat evenly. Season with salt. Keep warm.</div>
<div class="method">To make the rye bread powder, preheat the oven to 325°F (165°C). Tear the bread into pieces, put them in a blender or food processor, and process until crumbs form. Spread the crumbs in an even layer on a baking sheet, drizzle with the butter, and season with salt. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until toasted.

<div class="method">To make the angelica mayonnaise, using the angelica sprigs and oil, prepare the <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c05_r1.htm#c05-s35">angelica oil as directed</a>; strain but don’t freeze. In a bowl, whisk the egg yolk until blended. Then, whisking constantly, slowly add the oil, drop by drop, until the mixture begins to thicken. Add the remaining oil in a slow, steady stream while whisking vigorously to form a mayonnaise. Season with salt and vinegar.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, arrange the potatoes on a plate, spoon the mayonnaise on top, dispense the cream cheese foam alongside the potatoes, and sprinkle everything with the shallot powder and bread crumbs. Garnish with angelica leaves.</div>

<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">1. If possible, use small new potatoes in an array of colors for added interest and a diversity of flavors.</span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">2. Rye bread powder is good for sprinkling over everything from baked potatoes with sour cream to salads to fish.</span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">3. Feel free to skip the siphon if you don’t have one. The cream cheese is tasty simply dolloped on top of the potatoes, although it will not be as light and airy.</span></p>

<div class="yield">MAKES 2 CUPS PORK BELLY SEASONING, PLUS 1¾ POUNDS (800 G) BELLY FOR USE AS BACON <span class="yield_pipe">|</span> PREPARATION TIME: 1 MONTH</div>
<div class="headnote">On the Arctic Circle where the winters are fierce, the residents of <a id="ind277a"/>Grímsey are isolated for months at a time. They require pantries stocked with preserved items like this pork belly to see them through the long cold season. The good news is that this recipe is not only practical but also addictively good. Gunnar transforms his pork belly into a ground seasoning that is like a grown-up version of bacon bits. He uses it to flavor pastas, salads, and potatoes and other vegetables. Of course, a single family can use only so much pork belly seasoning in a year (unless you want everything to taste like pork, which is not necessarily a bad thing), so here part of the belly is used for making the seasoning and the rest is saved for some of the best breakfast bacon you will ever fry up.</div>
<div class="ingredient">
<p class="IL_item"><strong>2¼ pounds (1 kg) pork belly</strong></p>
<p class="IL_head"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><a id="ind167a"/>CURING MIX (<span class="IL_font"><em>see</em></span> NOTES)</strong></span></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons salt</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>½ teaspoon pink curing salt No. 1</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>2½ tablespoons light brown sugar</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>2 cloves garlic, minced</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>4 fresh bay leaves, finely chopped (or crumbled dried bay leaves)</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Leaves from 5 sprigs thyme, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Leaves from 2 sprigs rosemary, chopped</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>4 handfuls wood chips or completely <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c10_r1.htm#c10-s74">dried onion peels</a> from 10 onions</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">Cut the skin off the pork belly. In a small bowl, stir together the salt, curing salt, nutmeg, sugar, garlic, bay leaves, thyme, and rosemary, mixing well. Rub the mixture evenly over the entire surface of the pork, then wrap the pork tightly in plastic wrap, making sure that it is airtight. Place the pork in a tray deep enough to collect the juices that will be released during the curing process. Set another tray on top of the pork along with a weight (soup cans work well) to compress it during curing. Wrap the whole set-up in plastic wrap, securing it tightly, and refrigerate for 3 weeks.</div>
<div class="method">Remove the plastic wrap and brush off the curing mix. Make a second batch of the curing mix (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c05_r1.htm#c05-note24">see notes</a>). Once again, rub the entire surface of the belly with the curing mix, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, place in a deep tray, weight down the belly, and refrigerate for 1 more week.</div>
<div class="method"><a id="page125"/>Remove the plastic wrap and brush off the curing mix. Wrap the belly in cheesecloth and hang in a cool, dry place for 1 day before smoking.</div>
<div class="method">Arrange wood chips on the bottom of a deep hotel pan or similar vessel lined with foil. Place the cheesecloth-wrapped belly in a perforated hotel pan that fits inside the first pan. Place over high heat. Ignite the chips with a kitchen torch, top with the perforated pan, and seal the entire set-up securely with aluminum foil. Allow the smoke to smolder out completely, about 45 minutes, before removing the foil. If a more intense smokiness is desired, repeat the process once or twice.</div>
<div class="method">Remove the belly from the smoker, unwrap the cheesecloth, and hang it in a cool, dry place for 3 days.</div>
<div class="method">Preheat the oven to the lowest setting. Cut one-fourth of the belly against the grain into thin slices. Arrange the belly slices in a single layer on a baking sheet, place in the oven, and dehydrate them, turning once during the dehydration process, for 12 hours, until completely dry.</div>
<div class="method">Break up the dehydrated slices and process them in a spice grinder to a fine powder. Transfer to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator. The powder will keep for up to 1 month. Use the remaining cured and smoked pork belly as bacon. It will keep well wrapped in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.</div>

<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">1. You must make two batches of this curing mix. Do not double the ingredients to make one big batch and save half of it for the second curing. The herbs must be fresh each time the cure is applied to the pork.</span></p>

<p class="Essays_nonindent">Spring and summer are fleeting in Iceland, especially on a remote island like <a id="ind278a"/>Grímsey, where the temperature rarely climbs high enough to induce a sweat. Although Iceland is warmer in the winter months than its name implies because of its position on the Gulf Stream, its growing season is still short.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">Gunnar takes full advantage of the gardening time available by coaxing dozens of herbs and root vegetables, such as parsnips, potatoes, beets, and carrots, from the box gardens he has built between the bird sanctuary and his restaurant. To carry the flavor of the Icelandic summer into the dark winter months, he has devised a clever way to preserve his herbs by infusing them in oil and then freezing the oil in vacuum-sealed bags (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c05_r1.htm#c05-s35">see recipe</a>) or <a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c05_r1.htm#c05-s36">ice-cube trays</a> until he is ready to add a little brightness to his moontime dishes.
