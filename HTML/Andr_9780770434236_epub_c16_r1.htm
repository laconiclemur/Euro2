<div class="chapter_opener_text" id="div13">Every year, when it’s open season in Spain, hunters gather in the fields to search for rabbits, or quail, or pheasants. My grandfather Ramón Puerta was one of those great Spanish hunters, and I vividly remember going hunting with him as a young child. I can still smell the leather belts full of ammunition and the gunshot in the air, and I can see the rituals of the hunt: waking up early, dressing in special pants, cleaning the guns. The hunter’s clothes are sometimes passed from generation to generation, and my mother preciously keeps all the tools that my grandfather used to make his own cartridges. He died when I was just six years old, but I can still see his two hunting dogs and remember his tales of shooting and fishing in the mountains of Asturias. On one expedition, he spent two or three days in a mountain cabin with a group of friends. Each day, one of the hunters would stay behind to prepare the food for the others. My grandfather never cooked, but on one occasion he tried to cook rice with the pheasants and quail they’d caught. He filled up an entire casserole of raw rice, not knowing that it doubles or triples in volume during cooking. Of course the rice started to bubble up and overflow. Soon it was everywhere, and the only thing he could use to scoop it up was some terra-cotta tiles from the cabin roof. When his friends returned from the hunt, they were astonished. “Ramón, how much rice did you cook?” they asked. “Look outside,” he replied. “There’s even more out there.”</div>
<div class="chapter_opener_text1" id="div14">It’s not just my family. The traditions of hunting and country food are essential parts of Spanish cooking. One of Spain’s national treasures, at least in the restaurant world, is the <span class="italic">asador</span>, or roasting house. In central Spain, where they raise lambs, one of the most popular dishes is a six-week-old baby lamb roasted on an <span class="italic">asador’s</span> wood-burning grill. It’s right around the Duero river, where they produce one of the best wines in the world, Ribera del Duero—the perfect match for the smoky flavor of the roasted lamb. Every <span class="italic">asador</span> either raises its own lambs or has a special relationship with a farm where they know the lambs, what they eat, and how they live. It’s that traditional connection to the land that gives Spanish cooking its vitality.</div>
<div class="chapter_opener_text1" id="div15"><a id="page243"/>Here in Washington, I’ve tried to build my own relationships with local farmers and the countryside that gives us so much. We buy our baby lambs and fresh rabbits from a farmer in the Appalachian hills of Fulton County, Pennsylvania. There, among the white clapboard homes and steepled churches that remind me so much of Aaron Copland’s music, Don Lake raises rabbits in his garden and lambs on his farm. It feels a lot like Asturias to me: a hilly region, where everyone seems to be a small farmer, raising chickens in their yard or growing vegetables to eat and sell.</div>
<div class="chapter_opener_text1" id="div16">It often seems that the only meats available in supermarkets are chicken, beef, and pork. But the truth, as Don knows, is that the world of meats doesn’t end there. If you dig around in your supermarket, or find a good butcher at a local market, you can rediscover the forgotten pleasures of a rabbit stew, or a roasted lamb, or a juicy quail.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div18"><span class="italic">Allioli</span> is the national sauce of Catalonia—it accompanies practically any grilled meat. Catalans also have a sweet tooth, which you find in traditional recipes like codfish with honey, or meats cooked with fruits. Honey <span class="italic">allioli</span> is a traditional combination that goes perfectly with lamb. Even with its garlic flavor, you’ll find this dish is popular with kids, too.</div>
<div class="yield" id="div19"><span class="pink"><span class="bold">Serves 4</span></span></div>
<div class="ingredients" id="div20">
<div class="IL_item_top" id="div21">1 rack of lamb (about 1 pound)</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div22">1 sprig fresh rosemary</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div23">1 tablespoon Spanish extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for brushing the meat</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div24">½ cup <a class="hlink" href="Andr_9780770434236_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-s01">Allioli</a></div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div25">2 tablespoons lavender honey (or any other honey you like)</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div26">Salt to taste</div>
</div>
<div class="method" id="div27">Heat the oven to 250 degrees.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div28">Using a sharp knife, remove the fat from the rack of lamb so the bones are clean but still attached to the loin.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div29">Place the lamb, with the bones facing down, on a roasting rack or directly in a roasting pan. Break the sprig of rosemary into a few pieces and sprinkle them over the lamb. Brush the lamb with a little olive oil. Roast for 30 minutes, or until the interior of the meat reaches 130 degrees. While it is cooking, baste the meat once or twice with a little oil from the pan.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div30">Meanwhile, combine the <span class="italic">allioli</span> and the honey in a bowl. Use a fork to mix them together thoroughly.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div31">Remove the lamb from the oven and allow it to rest for 3 or 4 minutes.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div32">Heat the 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large sauté pan over a high flame. Place the whole rack of lamb in the pan and sear for 10 seconds on each side to brown it.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div33">Cut the rack into pieces along the bones. Place a spoonful of honey <span class="italic">allioli</span> on each plate, and top with a piece of lamb. Sprinkle with salt to taste, and serve.</div>

<div class="tip_header" id="div34"><span class="bold">José’s tips</span></div>
<div class="tip_text" id="div35">We sear the lamb at the end, not the beginning, because we want to achieve the Maillard reaction. What’s that? I don’t want to get too deep, but it’s what happens every time we brown meats that are rich in sugar. By roasting the lamb slowly, we lose much less juice than during traditional roasting at high heats. And by searing it at the end, we can also conserve more of the lamb’s succulent juices.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div37">I have to admit I have a taste for sweet things. While I was not born in Catalonia, I grew up there and was fascinated by the many regional dishes that mix fresh or dried fruits with meats. I was inspired to create this meat and fruit pairing by the wonderful peaches I’ve bought at my local farmers’ market at Dupont Circle in Washington, D.C. It evokes the best of this wonderful Catalan combination.</div>
<div class="yield" id="div38"><span class="pink"><span class="bold">Serves 4</span></span></div>
<div class="ingredients" id="div39">
<div class="IL_subheader_top" id="div40"><span class="bold">For the meatballs</span></div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div41">½ ounce (about ½ slice) stale white bread</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div42">2 tablespoons whole milk</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div43">1¼ pound ground beef (coarsely ground)</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div44">1 garlic clove, peeled and finely chopped</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div45">2 tablespoons very finely chopped parsley</div>

<div class="IL_item" id="div52">1 tablespoon sugar</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div53">2 tablespoons unsalted butter</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div54">1 ripe, medium-size peach, peeled, halved, pitted, and sliced into 12 segments</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div55">2 tablespoons sherry vinegar</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div56">1½ cups <a class="hlink" href="Andr_9780770434236_epub_c14_r1.htm#c14-s05">Chicken Stock</a></div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div57">1 cinnamon stick</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div58">1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley</div>
</div>
<div class="method" id="div59">Prepare the meatballs: Place the bread in a small bowl and pour the milk over it, using just enough milk to soften the bread. Let it sit for 1 minute.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div60">In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, milk-soaked bread, garlic, parsley, and egg. Using a spoon, mix all the ingredients together. Add the salt, and continue mixing. Place the flour on a plate. Form 1-inch balls of the meat mixture (you should end up with 12 meatballs), and roll them in the flour. Shake off any excess flour, and set the meatballs aside. Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan over a medium flame. When the oil reaches 350 degrees (measured with a candy thermometer), add the meatballs in small batches. Pan-fry until brown all over, about 4 minutes. Set the meatballs aside on paper towels to drain.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div61">Make the sauce: In a small sauté pan, toast the pine nuts over medium-low heat, stirring regularly to ensure they don’t burn, until they turn light brown, 3 minutes. Remove the pine nuts from the pan and set aside.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div62">Place a large sauté pan over low heat, add the sugar, and cook until golden, about 2 minutes. Stir the butter into the sugar and allow it to melt. Then add the peach slices and sauté until they are brown on all sides, about 2 minutes. Remove the peaches and set them aside. Add the vinegar and cook until reduced by half, about 1 minute. Add the stock, reserved pine nuts, and the cinnamon stick. Cook until the sauce starts to thicken, about 3 minutes.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div63">Add the meatballs to the pan. Bring the sauce to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook for 5 minutes, moving the pan constantly to ensure that the meatballs cook evenly. The sauce should end up being thick and syrupy. Return the peach slices to the pan to heat through. Sprinkle with the parsley, and serve immediately.</div>

<div class="RT_spanish" id="div66"><a class="hlink" id="ind78a"/>Conejo con cerezas Santa Coloma de Cervellò</div>
<div class="headnote" id="div67">Santa Coloma de Cervellò is very close to my heart because it’s the town where I grew up. From my bedroom window I could see the orchards and the blanket of pink cherry blossoms each spring. (Maybe that’s one reason why I love living in Washington, D.C., with its breathtaking cherry blossoms.) I remember spending hours after school among the trees, stuffing my face with cherries. They were dangerous pickings, too, with the shotgun-toting farmer looking out for us. To this day, the cherries of Santa Coloma de Cervellò remain the best I’ve ever tasted. When I was just fourteen, I collected recipes in a tiny book that the town council printed. Among them was a dish of<a class="hlink" id="ind55a"/> rabbit with cherries, not so different from the recipe here.</div>
<div class="yield" id="div68"><span class="pink"><span class="bold">Serves 4</span></span></div>
<div class="ingredients" id="div69">
<div class="IL_item_top" id="div70">½ medium rabbit, preferably a front quarter (about 1 pound), cut into 8 pieces</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div71">1¼ teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div72">2 garlic cloves</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div73">3 tablespoons Spanish extra-virgin olive oil</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div74">1 Spanish onion, peeled and thinly sliced</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div75">18 fresh cherries, pitted and halved</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div76">½ cup sweet wine, such as sherry or moscatel</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div77">2 cups <a class="hlink" href="Andr_9780770434236_epub_c14_r1.htm#c14-s05">Chicken Stock</a></div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div78">1 cinnamon stick</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div79">Salt to taste</div>
</div>
<div class="method" id="div80">Sprinkle the rabbit with ¼ teaspoon salt. Split open the garlic cloves by placing them on a chopping board and pressing down hard with the base of your hand or with the flat side of a knife. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large pan over a high flame. Add the rabbit and brown, about 4 minutes on each side; you want to brown the outside quickly, without drying the inside. Remove the rabbit pieces and set aside.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div81">Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil to the pan. Sauté the garlic for 1 minute. Add the onions and 6 of the cherries. Cook until the onions are caramelized and soft, around 20 minutes. Be careful not to burn the onions. If they start to get too dark, add 1 tablespoon of water.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div82">Once the onions are soft and brown, raise the heat to high and add the sweet wine. Cook until the wine has evaporated, 2 minutes. Add 1 cup of the stock and transfer to a blender. Blend thoroughly, strain, and return to the pan. Return the rabbit to the pan and heat over a low flame. Add the cinnamon and the remaining stock, and cook slowly for 10 to 15 minutes. Add salt to taste.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div83">Place the remaining 12 cherries in the pan and cook gently for 5 minutes. (Don’t overcook the cherries or they’ll fall apart and lose their freshness.) Serve immediately.</div>
