<p class="author1"><span class="txit">casseruola di melanzane con patate</span></p>
<p class="noindent">My family refers to this casserole as Nonno’s dish. As my mother explains, “It was Stan’s father who originally prepared this recipe. I remember enjoying it on a cold, rainy day when we were camping in upstate New York. Stan’s sister Rosalinda lived near our campsite so she and her husband, Lee, brought Nonno’s dish, still warm from the oven, over for lunch. It was just what we needed to cheer up an otherwise dreary day.”</p>
<p class="indentb">This casserole may be assembled one day in advance, refrigerated overnight, and baked the next day. Or it may be assembled and frozen for up to one month. Allow the casserole to defrost before baking, or bake the frozen casserole for an additional thirty minutes. It is an excellent complement to meat or chicken.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 medium-size eggplant, cut into <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>-inch-thick slices</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 medium-size zucchini, cut into <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>-inch-thick slices</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 medium-size all-purpose potatoes, peeled and cut into <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub>-inch-thick slices</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>-inch-thick slices</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cups <a class="nounder" href="ach59.html#page_120">Sailor’s-Style Sauce</a> or your own favorite marinara sauce</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup finely grated pecorino Romano cheese</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Preheat the oven broiler.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Lightly brush both sides of the eggplant and zucchini slices with some of the olive oil, and place on a baking sheet. Place under the broiler and brown lightly on each side, about 2 minutes per side. Remove from the oven and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_227"/><span class="red">3.</span> Place about one third of the remaining olive oil in a large sauté pan set over medium-high heat. Sauté the potatoes, then the bell pepper, adding more oil as necessary and cooking each vegetable until slightly cooked but still firm, 3 minutes on each side.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Preheat oven to 350° F.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> Cover the bottom of a large shallow dish with about <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup of the marinara sauce. Arrange a layer of eggplant slices on top of the sauce. Top the eggplant with a thin layer of marinara sauce and a sprinkling of the Romano cheese. Layer the zucchini on top of the eggplant, followed by a layer of potato, and finally a layer of bell pepper. Top with the remaining marinara sauce and Romano cheese.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">6.</span> Cover and bake until the mixture is bubbling and the vegetables are tender, about 40 minutes. Remove the cover and continue baking until the vegetables are soft when pierced with a fork, about another 10 minutes. Allow the casserole to stand for 10 minutes before serving.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATIONS</span>:</span> To make a great cold sandwich, place a leftover portion of this casserole between slices of Italian bread.</p>
<p class="noindenta">Some of the recommended alternative ingredients for this dish include substituting a green or yellow bell pepper for the red pepper and substituting yellow squash for the zucchini.</p>
<p class="noindenta">A smaller, deeper casserole may be substituted for the large shallow one called for here. Arrange alternating layers of the vegetables as you would when preparing lasagna, and proceed with the recipe as written, cooking the covered casserole for approximately 15 additional minutes until the mixture is bubbling before removing the cover. Continue to bake until vegetables are soft when pierced with a fork, about another 10 minutes.</p>
