			<p class="rec-intro">This is an impressive-looking dessert, but can be made with shop-bought puff pastry and most of the work can be done in advance. The light, crisp feuilleté – puff pastry circles – are slightly hollowed out which makes them lighter, and the Kirsch-soaked grapes are mouth-wateringly good. The longer they are soaked the better they are. Put it all together with the warm sabayon sauce at the last minute and serve right away.</p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 4</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">icing sugar, for dusting</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">360g all-butter puff pastry </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">320g seedless white grapes</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">100ml Kirsch</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">100g caster sugar</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">80ml water</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">6 medium free-range egg yolks</p>
		</div>
		<div class="basic-text-frame">
			<p class="body">Dust your work surface with icing sugar and roll out the pastry to a thickness of 5mm. Cut out 8 circles and place these on a moistened, non-stick baking tray – brushing the baking tray with water stops the pastry shrinking. Leave the pastry to rest in the fridge for at least 20 minutes. </p>
			<p class="body">Meanwhile, peel the grapes with a small knife or a teaspoon, and put them in the Kirsch to marinate. Make a sugar syrup by boiling the caster sugar with the 80ml of water. Preheat the oven to 230°C/Fan 210°C/Gas 8.</p>
			<p class="body">Dust the puff pastry circles with a little more icing sugar and put them in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Turn the heat down to 180°C/Fan 160°C/Gas 4 and cook for another 10 minutes, until golden brown and puffed up. Place on a wire rack to cool. </p>
			<p class="body">Drain the grapes, reserving the Kirsch. Put them in a pan with half the sugar syrup and warm through over a low heat. </p>
			<p class="body">To make the sabayon, put the egg yolks, Kirsch (collected from the grapes) and the rest of the sugar syrup in a bowl over a pan of simmering water. Whisk over a low heat until you have a smooth rich sauce and the whisk leaves a trail when lifted. </p>
			<p class="body">Using the point of a knife, carefully hollow out the pastry circles – working from the top of 4 of them and from the bottom of the other 4 – removing any pastry that may not have fully cooked. Place the 4 bases on a plate, fill with the warmed grapes and sabayon, and pop the lids on top. Serve at once. </p>
