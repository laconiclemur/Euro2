<p class="normal"><b>I’ve used duck eggs to give a rich and interesting flavor to these cocottes, but do watch the timing so the yolks remain soft and runny. The dried mushrooms add an intense burst of flavor to the finished dish. They can be prepared up to a week in advance and kept in an airtight container.</b></p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">SERVES</span></b> 4</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 30 minutes, plus 1 hour infusing</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 25 minutes, plus 2½ hours drying</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE DRIED MUSHROOMS</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">3 cups thinly sliced button mushrooms</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 egg whites, lightly beaten</p>
<p class="acktxta">1 teaspoon crushed sea salt, plus extra to season</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE ROSMARY CROûTES</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">leaves from 1 rosemary sprig</p>
<p class="acktxta">8 slices day-old baguette, each about ⅛ inch thick</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">FOR THE EGGS</span></b></p>
<p class="acktxt">3 cups roughly chopped mixed wild mushrooms</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 teaspoon olive oil</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ small shallot, finely chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ garlic clove, finely chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">5 thyme sprigs, leaves picked from 1 sprig</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 tablespoons unsalted butter, soft</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 duck eggs or extra-large hen eggs</p>
<p class="acktxt">1¼ cups chilled whipping cream (it must be straight from the refrigerator)</p>
<p class="acktxt">freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> To dry the mushrooms, heat the oven to 150°F, not on a fan setting, and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Add the mushrooms in a single layer, brush lightly with the egg whites and sprinkle with the salt, then bake 2½ hours, or until they are dry and crisp. Remove the mushrooms from the oven and leave to cool. Blitz 2 small handfuls into a powder in a mini food processor, then leave to one side. (You can store the remaining mushrooms in a sealed container up to one week.)</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Meanwhile, to make the croûtes, put the oil and rosemary leaves in a saucepan and heat. Remove the pan from the heat and leave to infuse 1 hour. Strain the oil through a fine strainer and discard the rosemary.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Turn the oven up to 275°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Brush both sides of the bread slice with the rosemary-infused oil and place in the baking sheet. Cover with a second piece of parchment paper and a slightly smaller baking sheet, which fits inside the large one. This helps the bread stay flat and toast evenly. Bake 8 to 10 minutes until the slices are light golden, then leave them to cool between the baking sheets.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Meanwhile, bring a saucepan of water to a boil. Add the chopped wild mushrooms and return the water to a boil. Drain well, then tip the mushrooms onto paper towels and pat dry. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the oil, shallot and garlic and cook 2 minutes, or until soft but not colored. Turn the heat up to high, add the mushrooms and sauté 2 minutes longer, or until just soft. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then add the thyme leaves, cover with a lid and leave to one side.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> After the croûtes are removed from the oven, turn the oven up to 350°F. Line a small roasting pan with parchment paper and brush the insides of four ⅔-cup ramekins with the soft butter. Spoon the mushrooms into the ramekins and crack an egg into each one. Pour the cream over to just cover, season with salt and pepper and top each one with a thyme sprig. Put the ramekins in the roasting pan, pour in enough hot water to come halfway up the sides and bake 10 to 12 minutes until the tops are just set. Turn off the heat and leave in the oven 2 to 3 minutes longer, but make sure the yolks remain runny. Sprinkle with the dried mushrooms and serve with the rosemary croûtes for dipping into the egg.</p>

<h6 class="h6k"><a id="pageid_40"/><b>DEHYDRATING FOOD</b></h6>
<p class="normal">Intensity of flavor has to be the number one reason for dehydrating foods. Although, of course, it originated in ancient times as a simple, but effective, means of preserving foods through the lean winter months, now it’s more about the fact that taking out the water not only means bacteria can’t grow, it also produces some radical transformations, concentrating both taste, texture and goodness. Plus, it still means you don’t have to waste any seasonal gluts, but can, instead, easily transform all kinds of foods into handy pantry items, from fruit strips that make a great lunchbox snack to dried mushrooms to sprinkle into a risotto to intensify the flavor.</p>
<p class="normal">Of course, drying food will never replace freezing, as that does a better job of retaining the taste, appearance and goodness of fresh food. But dehydrating is easy, costs virtually nothing, does not need any special equipment—and still gives you a huge range of flavorsome and densely textured treats to enjoy.</p>
<p class="normal1a"><b>Sun-dried produce</b></p>
<p class="normal1a">Not surprisingly, the original dehydrator was the sun! And you’ll still see fruit, vegetables or herbs spread out on cloths or wooden trays in sunny courtyards or barn roofs when you are on vacation in hotter climes. In Portugal, Spain or even Madagascar, you might come upon rows of flattened fish laid out to dry, a traditional practice as popular as salting or smoking.</p>
<p class="normal">Drying food in hot countries is virtually effortless. In cooler, more humid areas, it can be more challenging. If you are not careful, food can become moldy on the drying tray, so techniques have to be different. Reindeer meat in Scandinavia, for example, is pickled in salt water before being dried in the spring sunshine when the air temperature is below zero, while in Iceland, shark meat is also dried in subzero temperatures.</p>
<p class="normal">But commercial dehydrators don’t need sunlight. They push hot air around the food to dry it quickly and conveniently whatever the weather.</p>
<p class="normal1a"><b>At The Vineyard</b></p>
<p class="normal1a">In The Vineyard kitchen, as in many professional kitchens, we often use dehydrators. A subtle, sweet celery leaf sprinkled with sugar can become as transparent and fragile as glass to finish a terrine. Slices of pancetta, gently oven-crisped, then finished in the dehydrator, are perfect crumbled over a pea velouté, roasted poultry, a risotto or even roast pork. A few blanched, dried mushrooms can be blitzed to a dust to flavor soup or an egg <i>en cocotte</i> (see <a href="035_9781848991583_Recipe28.html#pageid_39">page 39</a>).</p>
<p class="normal1a" style="margin-top:1em;"><b>Dehydrating at home</b></p>
<p class="normal1a">But you don’t need a commercial dehydrator, and you don’t need to live in the land of eternal sunshine either—though wouldn’t that be nice! In our house back in France, drying ingredients was a seasonal affair. Every fall, wooden boxes lined with newspaper would appear in the boiler room, perched on the top of the boiler, and gradually be filled with our harvest of mushrooms. The boiler room was always the warmest part of the house. Not surprisingly, our dogs soon realized this and selected it as their winter bedroom—sensible creatures! That memory makes me smile, as it is so fresh in my mind.</p>
<p class="normal">Newspapers, by the way, are ideal for absorbing moisture from drying foods and I still use them today. I dry foods in my glass greenhouse—the sun’s heat on the enclosed space dries foods like tomatoes perfectly. I also dry herbs, especially basil and tarragon, and use them to flavor oils, but I do that in the microwave. Just spread out the separate leaves on a sheet of paper towel, lay another sheet on top, then microwave on High for three or four 30-second bursts, watching carefully. Mostly, however, I dry food in my domestic oven on a very low setting. I usually make use of the time control, then I can just leave it alone to do its own thing for long periods without interruption. It’s quicker to dry food in an oven than by sun-drying or even using a dehydrator, and you only need a couple of baking sheets and a thermometer. It’s true you can only make small quantities in an oven, but I think that can be an advantage. It means you can experiment with plenty of different foods and there’s no risk of making the effort to dry a large quantity of something you later decide you don’t like!</p>
<p class="normal"><a id="pageid_41"/>You can dry most foods, apart from those with a high water content, such as cucumbers, because they are likely to spoil before the process is finished. Fruit tend to become crisp more quickly than vegetables, but you can dry most things in 8 to 12 hours. Good vegetables to start with are onions, garlic and peppers. For fruit, try apples, peaches, apricots or pears.</p>
<p class="normal1a"><b>How to dehydrate food in your oven</b></p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindent">•  Make sure your equipment, surfaces and hands are all clean.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindent">•  Only fresh, good-quality food will give the best results. Wash it, then pat it dry with paper towels.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindent">•  Prepare the food as though you were cooking it, so you might peel and core an apple, remove the pit from a plum, trim the fat off meat. Then leave them whole, or cut into thin slices or strips.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindent">•  For foods like apple that tend to go brown when cut, add 1½ teapoons vinegar or lemon juice to 1 cup of water, then dip the slices as you cut.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindent">•  Blanch hard fruit or vegetables in boiling water for a few seconds, then refresh in ice water and pat dry.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindent">•  Fruit like apples, pears, peaches and rhubarb will keep their flavor if you poach them first in a light syrup.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindent">•  You can marinate meats in olive oil and vinegar, then toss with seasonings before dehydrating.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindent">•  Put food in a single layer, not overlapping, on a lined baking sheet or a wire rack in the oven (or the racks in your hydrator). Put a drip tray under meat. Items with similar drying times can be mixed on a rack.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindent">•  Switch on the oven to 115° to 150°F or lower, depending on the recipe. If your oven doesn’t go below 150°F, don’t worry. Set it to its lowest temperature but leave the oven door slightly open, enough for the air to circulate and keep a constant temperature.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindent">•  Turn the tray every 30 minutes or so if you can until the food is completely dry. That will be 4 to 5 hours for beets, onions and peppers; 6 to 8 hours for garlic; 8 to 10 hours for apples, mushrooms and pears; 10 to 12 hours for apricots, peaches and potatoes.</p>
<p class="normal">Most dried foods will last well, so keep them in sterilized, airtight jars in a cool, dark, dry place—then you can enjoy intriguing your friends at your next dinner party.</p>
<p class="normal1a"><b>Dehydrated Pumpkin Crisp</b></p>
<p class="normal1a">This makes an easy introduction to drying vegetables so do have a go at making this delicious sprinkle for your next risotto.</p>
<p class="normal">Start by heating the oven to 150°F and lining a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Then, simply grate the flesh of 4 ounces peeled butternut squash or pumpkin into long spaghetti-like strips straight over the baking sheet. Bake 4½ hours, turning the baking sheet halfway through. The strands will stick together in a net-like shape and become dry and crisp. Simply break them over the dish to serve. They’ll keep in an airtight container for up to a month.</p>
<p class="normal">Follow the same recipe using strips of grated carrot or parsnip for delicious versions of the crisp. Or, why not try making a batch of each and breaking a colorful selection to finish off your dish.</p>
