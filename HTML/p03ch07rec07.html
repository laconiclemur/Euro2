<p class="summary">Franciscan monks returning from the Americas in the sixteenth century brought back seeds of various species of peppers of the <span class="italic">Capsicum</span> family, both sweet and hot, to plant in their monasteries along the Camino de Santiago in northern Spain and in Extremadura, where the monks of the Yuste monastery are believed to be the first to have planted them. They called them <span class="italic">pimientos,</span> which is like the word <span class="italic">pimienta,</span> used for the black peppercorns that had once arrived from the East, because they gave a similar sensation. Fresh peppers quickly became part of peasant cooking all over Spain, and dried and crushed or pulverized peppers became the most loved and indispensable of Spanish flavorings.</p>
<p class="summary">The use of peppers is so characteristic of Spanish cooking that an old friend of mine I met again when I was testing recipes for this book was afraid to eat anything at my house because he is allergic to them. Despite my assurances that I would not use any, he always insisted on taking me out to eat. Although there are many Spanish recipes without peppers, they are found in all kinds of dishes. Fresh mild-flavored bell peppers (they ripen from green through yellow to red) are used raw, roasted, fried, stewed, or stuffed. Green peppers are favored for the zing they lend, red ones for their sweetness. Intensively grown bell peppers from Murcia and Almería can be found in all European supermarkets, and throughout Spain, but there are dozens of other varieties that are typically known only in their own localities. A few of these have become known outside Spain. The small elongated green Padrón peppers (<span class="italic">pimientos del Padrón,</span> also known as <span class="italic">pimientos del Herbón</span>) of Galicia are usually mild, but the occasional one is extremely hot: the uncertainty attached to biting into one that may be hot adds an element of excitement. The small, pointy, mild, and gentle <span class="italic">pimiento de Gernika</span> is typical of Basque cooking. Traditionally, it was picked when ripe and left to dry hanging on long strings. Today it is used green and fresh as a tapa or a vegetable accompaniment to many dishes. The <span class="italic">pimiento Riojano,</span> which grows in La Rioja, cone-shaped with a pointed tip, is used mainly when red and sweet, but it appears in many local dishes when it is half green and half red. The peppers can be seen drying in garlands on village balconies. The small, sweet, bright red triangular <span class="italic">piquillo</span> peppers, from Lodosa in Navarre, are sold roasted and peeled in tins and jars. They have become fashionable since innovative Basque chefs began stuffing them with meat, fish, or cheese. <span class="italic">Cristal</span> peppers, smaller than <span class="italic">piquillos</span> and with a sweet delicate flavor, also from Navarre, are roasted over wood fires and sold in jars or cans.</p>
<p class="summary">By the nineteenth century, pepper-growing regions had begun to dry certain types of red peppers and to grind them to a fine powder called <span class="italic">pimentón.</span> In 1893, the Spanish gastronome Angel Muro wrote in his cookbook, <span class="italic">El Practicón,</span> that <span class="italic">pimentón</span> had become for almost all inhabitants of Spain a product of prime necessity, and that in Castile especially not a single food was put on the table that was not seasoned with it. Some called it “the Spanish vice.” Today, although many traditional regional dishes are flavored with <span class="italic">pimentón,</span> some Spaniards hardly use it at all.</p>
<p class="summary">Different varieties of peppers are picked when they are red and sun-dried or smoke-dried to be used whole, in flakes, or as ground <span class="italic">pimentón.</span> <span class="italic">Pimentón,</span> now usually referred to abroad as Spanish paprika, comes in three varieties: sweet and mild (<span class="italic">dulce</span>), bittersweet (<span class="italic">agridulce</span>), and hot (<span class="italic">picante</span>), all of which may also be smoked. <span class="italic">Pimentón dulce</span> is the most widely used; there are few hot dishes in Spain. <span class="italic">Pimentón picante,</span> which is similar to cayenne or chile powder, is not greatly appreciated except in Galicia, Extremadura, and the Canary Islands. Murcia is known for its <span class="italic">pimentón dulce.</span> The <span class="italic">pimentón</span> from the Valley of La Vera, in northern Extremadura, has a smoky flavor. Traditionally, tobacco farmers there dried their tobacco leaves in barns heated by holm oak fires, and they used to hang peppers to dry at the same time, so the peppers absorbed the smell of the smoke. Eventually their flavor became so popular that the farmers moved their production from tobacco to <span class="italic">pimentón.</span></p>
<p class="summary">Small, round, a dark burgundy color, mild, and sweet, with a delicate flavor, <span class="italic">ñora</span> peppers are always used dried. They are beloved by Catalans, Valencians, and Murcians, who use them to flavor rice, pasta, fish, soups, and stews. These peppers are used to make sweet <span class="italic">pimentón dulce</span> in Murcia. The dried <span class="italic">choricero</span> peppers from the Basque Country, Navarre, and La Rioja are not very different in flavor. A thick red paste made from the soaked pulp of dried <span class="italic">choricero</span> peppers is sold in jars. <span class="italic">Guindilla</span> peppers are hot chiles. The Basque <span class="italic">guindillas del norte</span> are small, long, and thin. When green, they are semisweet and piquant; as they ripen to red, they range from medium hot with a sweet flavor to hot. The red peppers are used fresh, fried in olive oil with garlic. Green <span class="italic">guindilla</span> peppers are sold preserved in white wine vinegar. Dried red <span class="italic">guindillas</span> are broken into flakes or pulverized to make <span class="italic">pimentón picante,</span> sometimes called <span class="italic">pimienta cayena.</span></p>
