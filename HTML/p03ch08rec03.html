<p class="chapterTitle1"><a href="contents.html#p03ch08rec_03" shape="rect" class="calibre9">batter for deep-frying shrimp, squid, and fish fillets</a></p>
</div>
<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">Here is a batter for coating raw shrimp to make</span> gambas en gabardina <span class="italic">(shrimp in a raincoat) and squid rings for</span> calamares en gabardina. <span class="italic">You can also use it for coating fish fillets to make</span> buñuelos de pescado <span class="italic">(fish fritters).</span></p>
<p class="qun">½ cup all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="qun">Pinch of salt</p>
<p class="qun1">½ cup cold water</p>
<p class="recsum">Make the batter quickly, just as you are about to fry. Put the flour in a bowl and sprinkle in the salt. With a fork, beat in the water—the water should be as cold as possible. Do not overbeat, or the batter will be chewy. It’s fine if it is slightly lumpy.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Coat the shrimp (shells removed, tails left on if you like), squid, or fish fillets in the batter so that they are well covered all over. To test if the oil temperature is right, drop in a little batter; if it floats back to the surface quickly, the oil is hot enough; if it touches the bottom, the oil is not hot enough; if it turns brown, it is too hot. The oil should never be allowed to smoke. Working in batches, drop the pieces one by one into the hot oil and fry just until crisp and lightly golden, turning them once. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Scoop any bits of burnt batter from the oil between batches. Serve at once.</p>
