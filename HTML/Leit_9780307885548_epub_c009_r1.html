  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">M</span><em>assa de pimentão,</em> a paste made from heavily salt-cured red bell peppers, is a classic Portuguese staple. Originally from the Alentejo province, the paste is the major flavor component of the region’s—and now, the country’s—cooking. Every cook has her own version, some made from fresh bell peppers, others from roasted peppers, and still others from paprika.</p>

  <p class="indent">Because this version is lightly salted and richly seasoned, all you have to do to make dinner is rub a bit of it on beef, chicken, or strong-flavored fish, or toss it with peeled, halved potatoes before roasting. It’s that simple.</p>

Top with a heavy pan, place the colander in a large bowl, and set aside for 5 days. On the sixth day, fish out the strips and brush off the salt, but don’t rinse them.

  <p class="center"><span class="big"><em>molho de piri-piri</em></span></p>

  <p class="center"><strong><span class="small">MAKES ABOUT 1½ CUPS</span></strong></p>

  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">P</span>ortuguese piri-piri sauce, which packs a gut punch of heat, is sprinkled into, smothered over, and smeared onto all types of dishes. Arguably, the most famous is Frango com Piri-Piri (see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Leit_9780307885548_epub_c004_r1.htm#page118">Grilled Chicken Slathered in Hot Sauce</a>). So proud are the Portuguese of their potent sauce, it’s been advertised as “Portuguese Viagra.”</p>

  <p class="indent">At farmers’ markets, old men in their <em>boné</em> hats sit behind tables covered with jars of neon-red homemade piri-piri sauce for sale. Some are nothing more than oil infused with the chile peppers, others contain a mixture of crushed fresh peppers and oil, and still others are a combination of oil, vinegar, peppers, and spices. This last version, the one given below, is what comes closest to store-bought piri-piri, and I think the added ingredients give a nice acidic smack to the sauce. The recipe can easily be halved.</p>

  <p class="indent">Now, while I admire your commitment to making this sauce from scratch, if you can’t find peppers with the right punch, there’s no shame in using a store-bought hot sauce, such as Frank’s RedHot or Tabasco brand pepper sauce.</p>

  <p class="extract"><strong><span class="small">ATENÇÃO</span></strong> <img alt="" src="../Images/Leit_9780307885548_epub_150_r1.jpg" /> <em>Piri-piri peppers are unavailable in North America, but the substitutions suggested below will give a similar wallop of heat. Whenever handling any types of chiles, wear latex gloves, and be assiduously careful not to rub your face, mouth, or eyes. If you do, it’ll be a painful experience you’re not soon likely to forget.</em></p>

  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">T</span>his recipe was given to me by my friend Edite Vieira, author of <em>The Taste of Portugal</em>, who in turn got it from an Angolan. She met him at a country market in the Ribatejo, where he had a vegetable stall. She was shopping for ingredients for her cooking show, and they got to talking. After a bit of coaxing on her part, he scribbled this down for her.</p>

I like to spoon it into one of my <em>tachinos de barro,</em> small earthenware bowls I bought in the pottery town of São Pedro do Corval, and place it on the table for guests. They can then scoop a bit onto their plate and dip into it.

The slap of raw garlic and the cooling herbal flavor of cilantro—two hallmarks of southern Portugal—made me think of Italian pesto. But using roasted almonds and aged Nisa cheese, two other classics of the region, makes this variation entirely Portuguese to my mind.

  <p class="extract"><span class="dropcaps">T</span>his is one of those recipes that require quotation marks, not out of affectation, but because it’s not a true mayonnaise. It contains no egg yolks or mustard. It’s nothing more than an emulsion of milk and oil. More Brazilian than Portuguese, it’s just now beginning to be used on the Continent. The taste is lighter and cleaner than that of an egg-based mayonnaise, allowing other flavors to come through.</p>

  <p class="indent">Since I was given the recipe, I haven’t stopped finding ways to cook with it. The master recipe is only a canvas for additions. Besides the uses in this book, I’ve smeared the variations on grilled meats and fish, used them as dips and in dressings, spread them on sandwiches, and stirred them into potato salads, much as I do with regular mayonnaise.</p>
