ention the towns of Jabugo, Guijuelo or Montánchez and you are guaranteed to set a Spaniard’s pulse racing, for these are the sacred cradles of the very best <em>Ibérico</em>
 ham and you will soon discover that <em>jamón</em>
 is virtually a religion here.</p>
<p class="indent">The <em>charcutería</em>
, cured meat stall, is easy to spot with its cancan chorus line of ham legs dangling from huge hooks above the counter. Catching an assistant’s eye can be quite a challenge amidst the forest of trotters. Black trotters, white trotters; it is all a matter of utmost importance to the ham lover. The <em>pata negra</em>
 belongs to the king of pigs, the hairy indigenous <em>Ibérico</em>
 race that produces the caviar of hams, while the paler is that of the European pink pig, an altogether different prospect in the world of <em>jamón</em>
 (see pages 48–9). Hand-cut slithers, or <em>virutas</em>
 of <em>Ibérico</em>
 ham are a just extravagance; the marbled flesh quite literally melts in your mouth. I once watched an ancient Señora empty her purse to pay for four tiny slices. She placed the waxed paper package carefully in her handbag and set off home bearing her prize with a new sense of urgency. When it comes to <em>jamón</em>
, nothing is wasted. Scraps from around the knuckle are chopped into small cubes and stirred into vegetable dishes, while ham bones give vital flavour to the <em>cocido</em>
, or stew (see page 88), and dozens of other traditional stews.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes the chorus line is replaced with a firebrick red curtain of sausages, such is the case in Santiago de Compostela’s market where the local, soft cooking <em>chorizo</em>
 takes precedent. It is the key ingredient in the traditional <em>Caldo Gallego</em>
, a hearty soup with beans and potatoes. The <em>chorizo</em>
’s distinctive colour and flavour is all down to paprika, <em>pimentón</em>
, Spain’s favourite spice. The <em>lacón</em>
, a short-cured shoulder of ham is popular in Galicia too, cooked with turnip tops. And, so it is that each region of the country has its own traditional speciality. The damp climate of Asturias made curing and air-drying nigh impossible so that the local <em>chorizo</em>
 and <em>morcilla</em>
, or black pudding, have always been smoked to preserve them. Meanwhile, the dry mountain air of Andalucia’s Sierra de Aracena proved perfect for curing hams.</p>
<p class="indent">It can all get quite confusing too. A <em>morcón</em>
 in Extremadura is a small rugby ball of pork, fat and paprika, a <em>chorizo</em>
 in disguise. Meanwhile, a few hundred kilometres to the east in Murcia, the spherical <em>morcón</em>
 is boiled rather than cured and sliced like a ‘luncheon meat’, a rather superior one of course. Salamanca is Iberian pig country and the locals take their <em>embutidos</em>
, or cured meats, extremely seriously. Andres Vicente’s stall in the municipal market is an unbelievable spectacle, with a vast array of pork sausages, hams, shoulders, loins and tongues – smoked or plain, hard cured or soft. It would take days to taste your way through the selection, an ideal project for a short city break perhaps?</p>
<p class="indent">So, pork is without a doubt the star of the <em>charcutería</em>
 and, in fact, if you spot a <em>chacinería</em>
 that is all he will sell. However, there are a few other cured meats that deserve a mention:</p>
<p class="indent">In mountainous regions the white, paprika-free, <em>longanizas</em>
 or <em>salchichones</em>
 may be made with wild boar, or venison instead of, or in addition to, pork. León has its <em>cecina</em>
, a cured beef, or less commonly horse, with a subtle smoked flavour that makes a wonderful starter with a dash of olive oil. A relative newcomer to the counter is the <em>jamón de pato</em>
, or cured duck breast, produced in Navarra alongside <em>foie gras</em>
 and <em>confit</em>
, French tastes that have recently taken Spain by storm.</p>

<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_4">cured meat platter</h1>
<p class="nonindent">This is without a doubt the easiest, and yet arguably the most delicious starter in existence. A plate of carefully selected cured meat with a few tasty accompaniments, if you feel like it, although none are strictly necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">You could serve one or all of these cuts, the only rule being to allow about 80 g/3½ oz per person. As an absolute treat I would buy the more expensive <em>Ibérico</em>
 ham, or <em>Pata Negra</em>
 as it is known in Spain, but the more economical <em>Serrano</em>
 would be fabulous too. <em>Illustrated on page 51</em>

<p class="extract">
<strong>Cured pork</strong>
</p>
<p class="nonindent5">
<span class="gray">When buying any cured pork, whether it is ham, loin or sausage, you should be aware of two distinctly different products. Firstly there is the cured meat of the ordinary ‘white’ pig, usually referred to as <em>Serrano</em>
 that accounts for about 90% of the market, and secondly there is the highly exalted flesh of the native Iberian ‘black’, <em>Ibérico</em>
 or <em>Pata Negra</em>
, pig that often commands truly exorbitant prices.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">White pigs are given commercial feed and are usually intensively reared while most their hairy black cousins live a relatively charmed life under the cork oaks of the ‘dehesa’ in Western Spain. To confuse matters further there are three qualities of <em>Ibérico</em>
 pig: <em>pienso</em>
, which is fed almost exclusively on grain, <em>recebo</em>
, which is fattened up with grain on top of its free-range diet of acorns, and lastly, that caviar of the Spanish larder, the <em>bellota</em>
, reared out in the oak forests snuffling up acorns, roots and herbs. <em>Ibérico</em>
 products have a refined, distinctly nutty flavour when compared with the more readily available <em>Serrano</em>
 meat.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">
<em>Jamón</em>
 is the cured leg of pork. The very best <em>Jamón Iberico de Bellota</em>
 is ideally carved off the bone by hand. It is usually served in wafer-thin <em>virutas</em>
, or shavings, rather than large slices (see illustration on page 50) and the deep magenta flesh is marbled with delicious fat. White crystalline specks in the meat are good news too, the sure sign of an acorn-fed hog. This ham is best eaten alone with no accompaniments at all. The hams of Jabugo, Guijuelo and Montánchez are the most celebrated but by no means the only ones to look out for.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">A good quality <em>Jamón Serrano</em>
 can be a real treat too: excellent in a bread roll, with melon or figs and a wonderful base flavour for many cooked dishes. The <em>denominaciones</em>
 (see page 16) of Teruel and Trevélez produce some of the best.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">
<em>Lomo embuchado</em>
 or <em>Lomo curado</em>
 is the cured loin of pork. It resembles a thick sausage until you cut into it revealing the lean flesh. It is marinated with garlic and paprika, encased in a skin and then air-cured. <em>Lomo</em>
 is an expensive treat, usually eaten alone to appreciate its delicate flavour and very rarely used in cooking.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">
<em>Chorizo</em>
 is a sausage flavoured with paprika. There are dozens of varieties but a few main points to keep in mind. If you are planning on eating it raw you will need to buy a fully cured <em>chorizo</em>
, such as the famous varieties from Navarra or Rioja. These are dense and firm and often sliced thinly like salami.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">Meanwhile, the links of soft <em>chorizo</em>
 require cooking and may be hot, <em>picante</em>
, or sweet, <em>dulce</em>
. Dark horseshoes of knobbly <em>chorizo</em>
 from León are delicious sliced and cooked simply in wine or cider (see page 54). <em>Chorizo</em>
 is a key flavouring in many rice and pulse dishes. Two other famous sausages just about fit into this family too - the <em>Morcón</em>
, from Extremadura and Andalucia, a miniature rugby ball of paprika spiced pork, and the <em>Sobrasada</em>
, from Mallorca, which is a paprika and pork paste encased in a skin, and delicious spread on bread.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent1">
<span class="gray">
<em>Salchichón</em>
 is the Spanish salami. It is a mixture of pork and fat flavoured with pepper and other seasonings, such as garlic or herbs. Vic, in Catalonia is famed for its <em>salchichón</em>
 and also the long thin version called <em>fuet</em>
, or whip.</span>

<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_6"><a id="page49"></a>
chilled melon soup with cured ham</h1>
<p class="nonindent">Here is a modern day spin on the deservedly popular combination of melon and <em>jamón</em>
, a fabulously refreshing starter for an oppressively hot day. You could stretch to some <em>virutas</em>
 of the very best <em>jamón Iberico</em>
 for this dish since you will not require a huge quantity. The <em>Piel de Sapo</em>
, or ‘toad skin’, melon would be the gastronome’s choice, but any ripe and tasty melon will do.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>1–2 ripe melons, about 1.5 kg/3 lb total</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>70 ml/2½ fl oz dry white wine to taste (optional)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>2 tbsp caster sugar dissolved in 4 tbsp water to taste (optional)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>juice of ½ lemon to taste (optional)</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<span class="gray"><br/>
</span>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<span class="gray">to serve</span>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>ice cubes</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>freshly ground black pepper</strong>
</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>100 g/4oz <em>jamón</em>
, preferably <em>Ibérico</em>
 (see opposite), shredded</strong>
</p>
<p class="extract">Halve the melon and scoop out the seeds into a sieve, then leave to drain over a bowl for about 10 minutes. We do not want to squander any juices. Remove the flesh from the skin. I find it easiest to slice the melon and cut off the flesh but you could scoop it out, if you prefer.</p>
<p class="extract">Next, purée the melon in a blender and taste. You may have selected the perfect melon and need no extra flavour at all. More likely you will need to add a little extra depth of flavour with the wine, more sweetness with the sugar or even a tart touch of lemon juice. Just play around until you are happy.</p>
<p class="extract">Transfer the soup to a container and leave to chill for at least an hour, making sure to cover the container otherwise the melon’s seemingly innocuous scent will taint everything else in the refrigerator.</p>
<p class="extract">When ready to serve, pour the soup into chilled bowls, add an ice cube, a good sprinkling of black pepper and top with the <em>jamón</em>
.</p>
<p class="extract">
<strong>Tip</strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is your melon is really ripe? Press on the stalk end and the melon should give a little. Sniff the bottom of the melon – a delicious sweet perfume is a sign of a melon in its prime. Do not delay in using because a ripe melon will deteriorate quickly.</p>

<h1 class="section0" id="heading_id_9">judías verdes con jamón</h1>
<h1 class="section00" id="heading_id_10">green beans with ham</h1>
<p class="nonindent">I first savoured these beans at a small restaurant in Miranda del Castañar. The hilltop town is a medieval gem with narrow alleys, rambling stairways and old ladies huddled on street corners playing cards. We were occasionally jolted back into the 21st century by the roar of ‘gooooooooool’, the cry of an overexcited Spanish football commentator; it was the World Cup. It can be hard to sum up much of an appetite in the sweltering summer heat, but I’m always up for a plate of greens and, with the addition of the <em>jamón</em>
, these are a most satisfying dish.</p>
<p class="aserves">serves 4 as a starter</p>
<p class="ingreds">
<strong>700 g/1½ lb flat green beans, trimmed</strong>

<p class="extract">Next heat the olive oil in a large frying pan, add the ham and fry until the fat begins to render. Add the garlic and continue to cook until it begins to turn golden.</p>
<p class="extract">Add the beans, stirring them to coat in the oil. Sprinkle with the vinegar and check the seasoning. The ham will probably provide enough salt but you may like to add a little pepper or paprika. Serve warm.</p>

<p class="indent">Chickpeas with black pudding may be served as a hearty breakfast for the hungry early risers – the market awakens at dawn – or as a lunchtime snack for businessmen or tourists.</p>
