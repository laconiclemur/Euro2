<p class="author1"><span class="txit">timpano di vegetali</span></p>
<p class="noindentb">When we were preparing this cookbook, Gianni offered this vegetarian variation on <span class="txit">timpano</span>. Despite its spectacular presentation, this dish is much simpler to prepare than you might think. All of the components may be prepared in advance: The eggplant may be broiled or baked one day ahead, and the sauce may be prepared one day in advance. Refrigerate the eggplant and sauce overnight and bring to room temperature before filling the timpano. In fact, the timpano maintains its shape best if it is baked earlier in the day and then reheated before serving.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">4 medium-size eggplants (about 1<sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> pounds each), cut lengthwise into <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub>-inch-wide strips with the peel removed from every other piece</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Kosher salt</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 tablespoons butter</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup plain dried bread crumbs</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup cold milk</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup diced onions</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup seeded and diced red bell pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup seeded and diced green bell pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup seeded and diced yellow bell pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">Freshly ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup quartered and thinly sliced carrots</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">3</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup thinly sliced tender celery</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">3 cups halved and thinly sliced zucchini</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil leaves</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cups canned whole plum tomatoes</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup fresh or frozen peas</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">3</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> pound penne, ziti, or fusilli</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">2 cups diced mozzarella cheese</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Generously sprinkle the eggplant slices with kosher salt, place them in a colander, and set aside to drain for 2 hours.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_178"/><span class="red">2.</span> Generously grease a 10-inch springform pan with 2 tablespoons of the butter. Sprinkle the bread crumbs on the bottom and sides of the pan. Do not knock out the excess crumbs. Set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a small saucepan set over medium heat. Whisk in the flour, then gradually whisk in the milk. Bring to a simmer and cook this white sauce, whisking regularly, until it thickens, about 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Reduce the heat and hold at a low simmer until you are ready to cook the pasta.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">5.</span> Warm 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a sauté pan set over medium-high heat. Add the onions and bell peppers and cook, stirring, until slightly softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the carrots and celery and continue cooking, stirring frequently, until they have softened slightly, about another 10 minutes. Stir in the zucchini, basil, and parsley and cook to soften slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, crushing them with your hand or the back of a slotted spoon as you add them to the pan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook until the tomatoes have sweetened slightly, about 10 minutes. Stir in the peas and white sauce, and cook until the peas are tender, 5 minutes. Continue to gently cook the vegetables over low heat, stirring occasionally, while the pasta boils.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">6.</span> Return the water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook for 2 minutes longer than recommended on the package. Drain well and stir into the vegetable sauce. Remove from the heat and transfer to a wide bowl. Allow the sauce to cool at room temperature.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">7.</span> Preheat the oven broiler, or a gas or charcoal grill. Pat the eggplant slices dry with paper towels. Lightly brush the eggplant slices with the remaining <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup olive oil. Brown under the broiler or on the grill, about 5 minutes per side.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">8.</span> Preheat the oven to 350° F.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><a id="page_179"/><span class="red">9.</span> Line the prepared springform pan with overlapping slices of the eggplant, alternating the peeled and unpeeled slices, allowing each slice to overhang the edge of the pan by about 3 inches. Line the center of the pan with eggplant, alternating the peeled and unpeeled slices, overlapping the ends of the side pieces. There should be a few pieces of eggplant remaining to fill the top of the timpano.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">10.</span> Stir the mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses into the cooled vegetable sauce. Fill the eggplant shell with the pasta/vegetable mixture, pressing down with the back of a wooden spoon to compact it in the pan. Fold the eggplant slices that are hanging over the edge of the pan back over the filling. Patch the center of the timpano with a few remaining slices of eggplant. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 15 minutes. Remove the foil, increase the oven temperature to 400° F, and continue baking until warmed through, another 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">11.</span> Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 10 minutes before removing the outer ring of the springform pan and placing on a serving platter. Serve immediately. (If you are baking it ahead of time, leave the timpano in the pan, cover, and store at room temperature. Reheat before serving.)</p>

<p class="noindenta" style="page-break-after: right;"><span class="red"><span class="smallcaps">VARIATIONS</span>:</span> This vegetable sauce may be tossed with fusilli, ziti, or penne and served as a pasta course. It also makes a nice filling for lasagna. Spoon <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">2</sub> cup of the sauce onto the bottom of a baking dish. Top with 3 precooked lasagna noodles. Top with sauce and continue layering, using a total of 12 precooked lasagna noodles. Bake at 350° F until the sauce bubbles, about 35 minutes.
