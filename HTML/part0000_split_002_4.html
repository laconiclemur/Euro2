<p class="MsoNormal2"><span lang="EN">Hello and Guten
Tag!</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN">I am so happy you picked this little book among all the thousands of
cookie, bake and cook books that have been published over the years. This is a
small collection of cookies that has been compiled from German and American
friends who are still traditional bakers.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN">Christmas is still the most important time to bake cookies in Germany. 
A virtual baking frenzy starts in early November to be ready for the Advent
time, four weeks before Christmas.  Countless tins will be filled and stored in
ice cold bedrooms.  Many pretty paper plates will be filled with a variety of
homemade cookies, chocolate and Marzipan, decorated with bows and fresh
greenery and given to friends and family and co-workers.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN">Of course, by now cookies are an all-year round treat, so don't feel
limited by just baking for Christmas.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN">Most of the recipes come from friends who were born around the second
World War and just cooked and baked for their family. None of us had any professional
training or pretended to know everything.  The only teachers were tradition and
experience.  As we moved, we experimented with high altitude, with low
altitude, with tired old ovens and with new temperamental ones.  We learned to
translate grams to cups.  We advanced from greased and floured cookie sheets to
parchment paper.  We still use the old-fashioned measure of a "pinch
" and a "tad."  And then there is the question, why you do have
to cool and rest the dough in the fridge before rolling it out ? You have to
let it come to room temp anyway before using it again.  Professional bakers are
probably cringing by now, but we do what works for us.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN">Our cookies are not beautiful little artifacts, but simple and
delicious treats that shine with great flavor. And of course, there are really
no “health food” cookies here.  This must be a contradiction in terms, except
for an occasional one without flour .</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN">So I would love to encourage you to try a few of these recipes and who
knows -- three or four might turn out to be your favorites, too.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><b class="calibre1"><span lang="EN" class="calibre3">A few helpful hints </span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN">Many of the German Christmas cookies in this book are made from a
traditional "<b class="calibre1">Knetteig</b>" (Kn-ate-tyke) which means a dough has
been kneaded by hand until it is smooth. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN">To make a Knetteig, mix flour and baking powder in a bowl, add the
sugar and small pieces of butter.  Cut the butter in with a pastry cutter or a
fork until the dough resembles coarse crumbles. Add slightly beaten eggs and
flavorings and work the dough with your hands until everything has been
incorporated and you have a smooth ball.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN">You can do this in a food processor also:  Pulse the dry ingredients a
few times to mix, cut in the butter and let it process until you have coarse
crumbles. Mix the slightly beaten eggs and let the blade work until it forms a
ball.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN">Of course, if you have a kitchen machine with a dough hook, that will
be the easiest.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><b class="calibre1"><span lang="EN" class="calibre3">Parchment and wax paper</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN">Lining cookie sheets with parchment makes baking cookies really easy. 
No buttering or spraying is necessary, nothing sticks, and although you might
think the parchment is a little pricey, it can be reused several times.  Just
wipe it off or shake off the crumbs and you are ready for the next batch.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN">Wax paper can be used to roll out the dough.  No need to add flour,
which keeps the cookies more tender.  We also cut out all the cookies at once,
placing them on wax paper and layering them on one cookie sheet.  The sheet
stays in the fridge until we are ready to bake, often the next day, then
transfer the cut-outs onto the parchment.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN">Not enough time to roll out the dough and cut out shapes?  A much
faster way is removing small amounts of dough and patting it out with your
hand.  Not as pretty as bells, hearts, stars, trees, comets or snow men, but it
tastes the same and the kids will gobble them up just as well.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><b class="calibre1"><span lang="EN" class="calibre3">Vanilla sugar</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN">Vanilla sugar in Germany is the normal preferred way to flavor a
dough.  “Dr. Oetker Vanille Zucker” comes in small yellow packages in many
supermarkets.  You can use either the artificially flavored vanilla or the
bourbon.  The more intense flavor is the artificial vanilla sugar.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN">However, if you plan ahead, fill a jar with powdered or regular sugar
and stick a vanilla bean into it.  The sugar will be infused in time.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN">Many of the ingredients like vanilla sugar, extracts, and spices that
are essential for gingerbread can also be found on-line at Germandeli.com.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><b class="calibre1"><span lang="EN" class="calibre3">Hazelnuts</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN">For many years, hazelnuts were the most widely known nut in Germany. 
Many people have bushes or trees in their backyards.  By now hazelnuts are a
quite fashionable flavor in the States, but still not easy to find for baking.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN">If you live close to a Trader Joe’s, an Aldi store, or a German deli or
bakery, you often can purchase hazelnuts either shelled and whole, or already
finely ground.  Note that one pound whole shelled nuts make 3 cups, and 1/4
pound ground nuts make about 1 3/4 cups.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN">If you grind the hazelnuts yourself, put not more than 1/4 pound nuts
into your food processor, adding some powdered sugar or flour to keep it
fluffy. Nuts have quite a bit of fat and would otherwise turn into a paste.  Best,
of course, would be if you can find an old-fashioned nut grinder if you cannot
already find the nuts ground.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal3"><span lang="EN">For a deeper flavor, carefully roast the whole nuts in the oven and
store the extra in the freezer.</span></p>
