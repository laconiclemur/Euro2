  <p class="nonindent sgc-1"><a id="page274"></a>The fresh, clean taste of live things from the sea is a welcome opening to any meal and a particularly useful possibility when composing a more or less complex menu in delicate balance, for it adds its dimension without placing restrictions on the choice of dishes to follow, and the light, sharp wine that best accompanies it leaves an equally open field in the <em>suite</em> of wines.</p>

  <p class="indent">The “turban” is highly decorative. The various poached fish-fillet and mousseline preparations count, certainly, among the most delicate and sumptuous in classical cooking and their lightness and fantasy offset perfectly the sobriety of an unadorned roast. The marriage of fresh strawberry and fresh raspberry is one of the most exquisite in the dessert world. The frozen mousse discourages an accompanying wine, but has no other failings.</p>

  <p class="indent">Much may be prepared in advance: The mousseline forcemeat, but for the final addition of cream, the <em>fumet</em> and the sorrel purée for the fish sauce, the vegetable purées, and the artichoke bottoms. The turban should be put to poach about 20 minutes before going to table and the saddle put to roast at the moment one is seated. The precooked artichoke bottoms may be put to stew in butter when the turban is served. Finishing the fish sauce and reheating the vegetable purées are rapid last-minute chores whose timing requires no forethought.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="c18-s66">THE SHELLFISH PLATTER</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Oysters, clams, mussels and sea urchins form the usual composition of a shellfish platter in France. All should be opened just before being served. A firm, moist, smooth, plump flesh is proof of the freshness of the first three (the ultimate test being their wriggling reaction to a drop of lemon juice at table). The undulating spines and the regular movement of the starlike orifice are sufficient proof of a sea urchin’s freshness. (See <em><a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c12_r1.htm#page213">Oursinade</a></em>, for the method of opening them.) The traditional accompaniments are lemon halves, wine vinegar with chopped shallot, coarsely broken-up (mignonette) white peppercorns, fresh, unsalted butter and thin slices of firm, fine-textured rye bread.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page275"></a>The northern Pacific Coast of the United States claims to produce a small oyster with a particularly delicate flavor. East Coast oysters tend to be “fatty” and their flavor has much less clarity than European varieties. (<em>Portugaises</em> and <em>claires</em>, elongated deep-shelled oysters with greenish flesh and delicate black beards, and <em>belons</em> and <em>marraines</em>, round and flat, the first with tan flesh, the latter, greenish, are the principle French varieties. The very fine oysters often found in England are of the same sort as the last two.) American cherrystone clams are, on the other hand, of a finesse unknown to that general variety of mollusk in France (French clams resemble, in a larger version, the gray-shelled <em>palourdes</em> and the little cocklelike <em>praires</em>). Razor clams, when they can be found, are a marvelous addition to a shellfish platter.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_2">THE TURBAN OF SOLE FILLETS WITH SALMON, SORREL SAUCE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">A fish-fillet and mousseline turban permits endless variations. Unlike certain preparations, its basic qualities suffer in no way through being subjected to the most elegant and formal of <em>grande cuisine</em> presentations.</p>

  <p class="indent">The forcemeat may be made of pike, whiting, sole, trout, etc. A particularly fine forcemeat, somewhat more difficult to manipulate because of the resistance of the flesh and its lack of body when raw, is made of lobster (in which case, the carapace and coral are transformed into an <em>à l’américaine</em> sauce—see <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c27_r1.htm#c27.1">Squid à l’Américaine</a>—pounded, sieved, reduced and creamed). The buttered mold may be lined with a décor of truffle slices, diamonds or crescents before the fillets are pressed into place, and chopped truffle peelings or chopped dried morels, first soaked, rinsed, sponged dry and stewed in butter, may be added to the forcemeat. Alternate sole and salmon fillets (the latter sliced lengthwise from a tail section of salmon the same length as the sole fillets) may be used to line the mold, forming a ravishing pink-and-white-striped turban. A spectacularly beautiful and voluptuous presentation and an exquisite assembly of flavors and textures are afforded by a truffle-studded pink-and-white turban, the central well of which is filled with a ragoût of crayfish tails bound by a Nantua sauce. This sauce is, technically, a creamed <em>béchamel</em> finished <a id="page276"></a>with crayfish butter. It may reasonably he prepared by sautéing the crayfish <em>à la bordelaise</em> (see shrimp preparation for <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_c20_r1.htm#c20.5">Shrimp Quiche</a>), removing the tails and, except for the emptied shells to be used for garnish, pounding everything remaining, cooking it for 10 minutes in the <em>béchamel</em>, passing it through a fine sieve, and buttering it lightly at the last moment. There is a surrounding ribbon of sorrel purée upon which, symmetrically arranged, are placed emptied crayfish shells, filled with forcemeat and cooked for 7 or 8 minutes in a gentle oven, the remainder of the Nantua sauce sent to table apart.</p>

  <p class="indent">Frozen products never produce a satisfactory mousseline forcemeat, nor will frozen fillets be resilient and moist after the poaching process.</p>

  <p class="indent">The proportions given are for a classic savarin mold (circular rounded bottom, large central tube), 10 inches in diameter.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c18-s67"><em><span class="color">Turban of Sole Fillets with Salmon, Sorrel Sauce</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Turban de Filets de Sole au Saumon, Sauce à l’Oseille</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>3 filleted soles (substitute grey sole, flounder or lemon sole for Dover sole if it is not available), weighing a good pound each, or 12 fillets plus the carcasses</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Mousseline forcemeat:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about 10 ounces fresh salmon</em> (<em>a good ½ pound, once bones and skin are removed)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 egg white</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup heavy cream</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 small handful shelled raw pistachio nuts</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, freshly ground pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>freshly grated nutmeg</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Fish fumet:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>the sole carcasses, cleaned, gills removed, chopped or broken up</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about ⅔ cup each dry white wine and water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 onion, finely sliced</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>a bouquet of parsley</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 bay leaf</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em><a id="page277"></a>½ teaspoon <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#page86">Mixed Herbs</a></em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>½ pound sorrel</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about</em> 6 <em>tablespoons</em> (3 <em>ounces</em>) <em>butter</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>butter for the mold</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Trim the fillets neatly and add the trimmings to the boned and skinned salmon fresh. Prepare the forcemeat base at least 2 hours in advance, using the above proportions, exactly as described on <a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#prf5.1">this page</a>. The pistachio nuts, first dipped for a couple of minutes in boiling water, drained, and rubbed in a towel to remove the skins, then coarsely chopped, are incorporated at the last minute, at the same time as the cream.</p>

  <p class="indent">Combine the ingredients of the <em>fumet</em> in a saucepan (salting very lightly in view of the eventual reduction), bring to a boil, and simmer, covered, for ½ hour, mashing coarsely the solid ingredients with a wooden pestle or spoon after about 20 minutes. Pass through a fine sieve, without pressure, and put aside.</p>

  <p class="indent">Remove the stems from the sorrel, pulling them backward, wash sorrel well in several waters, and parboil for a few seconds—just long enough for it to turn limp and lose its bright-green color. Drain, shred, and stew it gently in 2 tablespoons of butter (adding a bit more after a few minutes if the mixture seems too dry), lightly salted, stirring regularly, for about 15 minutes, or until the sorrel has melted into a near purée. Pass it through a fine sieve and put aside.</p>

  <p class="indent">Soak the fillets in cold water for about 10 minutes, spread them out on a paper towel, and sponge them dry with more paper towels. Flatten each fillet slightly by pressing against it with the fiat side of a large knife blade (fairly gently, so as not to break the fibers), and line the generously buttered mold, pressing them into place, skin side next to the mold, slightly overlapping, with the narrow tip of each fillet hanging over the inside wall (the central tube) of the mold, and the wider end hanging over the outside. (Slivers may be cut from some of the fillets and a bit of patchwork effected, if necessary.) Spoon in the raw forcemeat (the purée base of which will have been <a id="page278"></a>kept embedded in cracked ice, but mounted with the cream only at the last minute), tap the bottom of the mold firmly against a wooden surface 2 or 3 times to settle the filling and eliminate any air pockets, fold the fillet tips over to form the turban, and press a buttered round of kitchen paper over it, a small hole cut in the center and a few shallow slits cut spokewise out from it. (To prepare the paper, fold a square of paper, somewhat wider than the diameter of the mold, in four, round the unfolded corner, clip off the tip of the doubly folded corner, and cut 2 or 3 inch-long incisions in from that point.)</p>

  <p class="indent">Poach in a <em>bain-marie</em>, the mold immersed by two-thirds in hot, but not boiling, water, in a slow to medium oven (325° F.) for 40 minutes, or until the surface is resilient, firm, springy to the touch. The water must not boil or the fillets will be drained of their moisture. The poaching may be conducted over a tiny flame in a large, tightly covered saucepan or <em>marmite</em> if it is not convenient to use the oven. Remove the mold from the <em>bain-marie</em> and leave it to settle for 7 or 8 minutes before unmolding (the sauce will be finished during this time). To unmold, remove the buttered paper, place a fine wire grill (pastry grill or special grill for steaming vegetables) on top and turn grill and mold over together, as if to unmold. This will drain off the troublesome liquids which must otherwise be sponged up with towels from the serving platter. Turn mold and grill together back over and unmold the turban onto a preheated round serving platter. Surround it with a ribbon of sauce and send the rest to table separately.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE SAUCE</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Reduce the fish <em>fumet</em> in a heavy saucepan over a high flame, stirring frequently—and toward the end, constantly—by about two-thirds, or until it begins to acquire a light syrupy consistency. Add the sorrel purée, continue boiling and stirring for a few seconds until a light but distinct “body” is achieved. Remove immediately from the heat and whisk in the remaining butter (about 4 tablespoons), first cut into small pieces (or softened considerably at kitchen temperature).</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_3"><a id="page279"></a>THE ROAST SADDLE OF LAMB WITH HERBS</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">The entire saddle in a grass (yearling) lamb is about 1 foot in length. It is limited by the haunch, or upper limit of the leg, at one end and the first rib chops at the other, and comprises the fillets, filets mignons, (muscles corresponding, respectively, to the <em>faux-filet</em> and the fillet in beef cuts), and short sections of the side-belly known as “aprons.” Butchers often refer to this cut as “double saddle” or “English-cut saddle.” It is wise to order it ahead of time, for butchers often cut up the animals in advance, splitting the saddles and cutting them into loin chops. The flesh should be a clear rose-tan color (not a deep brownish-red), the fillet round and well defined, and the saddle should be surrounded by a healthy layer of firm, dry, white fat. It should be sufficiently aged.</p>

  <p class="indent">Many people prefer to leave a thin coat of fat to protect and nourish the flesh during the roasting process, but the delicate lamb, in this case, risks being tinged with the “woolly” mutton taste that some find disagreeable, and, properly conducted, the roasting will not dry out a saddle from which all traces of fat have been removed.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c18-s68"><em><span class="color">Roast Saddle of Lamb with Herbs</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Selle d’Agneau Rôti aux Aromates</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 saddle of lamb 8–10 inches long (3–3½ pounds)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 cloves garlic, peeled</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>a large pinch</em> (<em>level teaspoon</em>) <em><a class="hlink" href="../Text/Olne_9781607740155_epub_prf5_r1.htm#page86">Mixed Herbs</a></em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¼ cup olive oil</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, pepper</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>⅓ cup dry white wine (or water)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 tablespoons (1 ounce) butter (optional)</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Remove all the fat: That on the inside, next to the filet mignon and at the underside base of the apron, may easily be pried loose with the fingers. Using a small pointed sharp knife, make an incision through the layer of fat, the entire length of die saddle, following the line of <a id="page280"></a>the backbone. First on one side, then on the other, gently force the layer of fat loose from the fillet, using your fingers and, when it resists, the point of the knife, being careful to cut neither into the flesh itself, which is protected by a membrane to which the fat is only lightly attached, nor into the thin membrane that connects the apron to the fillet. Begin, now, at the far tip of the apron and, in the same way, loosen its layer of fat up to the connecting point. Slice through the layer of fat, parallel to the connecting membrane, leaving a thin layer of fat next to the membrane to ensure the apron’s remaining attached. Cut out the layers of fat and membrane separating the thin layers of flesh in the lower section of the apron.</p>

  <p class="indent">Rub the garlic cloves repeatedly against the rough surfaces of bone and over the entire surface of the meat, thus impregnating the bone itself, and lightly coating the flesh with garlic essence. Sprinkle the herbs lightly on all surfaces, most sparingly on the underside, and coat with olive oil, rubbing and patting with your hands to ensure an even distribution. Just before roasting, sprinkle the underside of the apron and the filet mignon with salt and freshly ground pepper and roll the aprons under so that the two rolls touch and rest firmly against the filets mignons (the rolls serve as the base of the roast and as protection for the filets mignons, which otherwise would be overdone before the fillets had reached their stage of perfection). The rolls may be skewered together crosswise or the roast held in shape by a couple of rounds of string, but this is not essential.</p>

  <p class="indent">Place the roast in a heavy, shallow baking dish of just the right size to hold it (otherwise, the drippings risk burning) and count a maximum of 10 minutes per pound of actual roasting time (25 to 30 minutes in this instance), starting with a very hot oven (425° F.) and, after 10 minutes, turning it down to medium (325° F.). Salt and pepper the surface at this time. Baste during the last 10 minutes or so and, after roasting is done, leave it in its roasting pan in a warm but not hot place for from 10 to 15 minutes so that the meat may relax (most practical is to remove the roast from the oven for a couple of minutes to arrest the cooking, at the same time turning off the oven and leaving the door open so that it may cool slightly before returning the meat to the warm, closed oven). Given all these precautions, the meat should <a id="page281"></a>be neither rare nor gray in color, but tender rose throughout. Send it to table, vegetable garnishes and juice separately, on a preheated platter (or, better, a special carving board with a well for collecting the juices), large enough to permit the easy distribution of meat slices after carving.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">THE JUICE</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">Skim off the fat from the roasting pan, place pan over a high flame, pour in the white wine and reduce by about two-thirds, stirring and scraping with a wooden spoon to dislodge and dissolve all caramelized adherences. Remove from the flame and swirl in the butter, first cut into small pieces; this transforms the clear juice into a light-bodied velvety sauce. Purists generally prefer a simple juice and may also require that the white wine be replaced by water.</p>

  <p class="center4"><span class="small">TO CARVE A SADDLE</span></p>

  <p class="nonindent">The carving knife should be long, narrow-bladed, with an upward curve at the point, and razor-sharp. The saddle should be placed endwise directly before the carver. Pierce the left-hand fillet with the fork and hold the roast firmly in place while slicing vertically downward the entire length of the roast, following closely the right-hand contour of the vertical protuberances of the backbone, thus cleanly separating the inner wall of the fillet from the bones. Slice inward, horizontally, removing 5 slices, the 3 center ones of which are regular in form and from ¼ to ⅓ inch thick. Reverse the position of the platter or plank and carve the other fillet in the same way. Slice off the aprons, cut each into 3 cross sections, turn the roast upside-down and, cutting first downward vertically against the bone, then inward horizontally beneath the filet mignon, still following closely the contour of the spinal bone protuberances, remove the filets mignons, whole, and section each crosswise into 3. This method produces, in a service for 6, 1 slice of fillet plus a fragment, 1 section of filet mignon, and 1 section of apron for each person. Serve on preheated plates and pass the sauceboat only when the carving has been finished and the resultant juices added.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_4"><a id="page282"></a>THE GREEN BEAN PUREE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Instead of rice, dried green flageolet beans, cooked until very tender with carrot, thyme, bay leaf and onion, may be used (1 part of cooked flageolets to 2 of green beans) to give the necessary body to the purée. The result is more velvety and the delicate flavor of the flageolets in combination with that of the green beans is exquisite. The rice method is simpler and the flavor more direct. Many people content themselves with passing the beans fairly coarsely through a vegetable mill. The result is palatable, but it is well worth going to the trouble of passing them a second time through a very fine drum sieve—the difference must be tasted to be believed.</p>

  <h3 class="section1" id="c18-s69"><em><span class="color">Green Bean Purée</span></em></h3>

  <p class="center3">Purée de Haricots Verts</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 heaping tablespoons rice</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>2 pounds fresh, tender green beans</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>salt, freshly ground pepper, freshly grated nutmeg</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>about ¼ pound butter</em></p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Parboil the rice for 15 minutes, drain it and rinse it. Wash the beans (it is not necessary to snap them as all the tips will remain to be discarded after the beans have been passed through the sieve) and plunge them, along with the parboiled rice, into a large pot of salted, rapidly boiling water. Keep at a rapid boil, uncovered, until the beans are just tender (a couple of minutes longer than if they were to be served whole, nonetheless). Pour the contents of the saucepan into a colander or large sieve and leave to drain for at least ½ hour, then pass beans and rice first through a <em>moulinette</em> (vegetable mill), using the medium blade, then, a couple of tablespoonfuls at a time, through a fine nylon drum sieve, using the plastic disk. Season to taste with salt, pepper and a tiny bit of nutmeg, smooth out the surface, and put aside, covered, until the last minute before serving.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page283"></a>Heat the purée in a heavy saucepan over a high flame, stirring rapidly and constantly to prevent sticking or burning. When sufficiently heated, remove from the heat and whip in the butter, cut into small pieces, then softened, using a wooden spoon. Incorporate as much as the beans can absorb without becoming too liquid—the purée, however, should be comparatively thin, not stiff.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_5">THE ARTICHOKE BOTTOMS WITH MUSHROOM PUREE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">Artichoke bottoms may be garnished with a variety of purées, among the finest being: broad beans, or <em>fave</em>, the skins first removed, the beans boiled until tender for 7 or 8 minutes with a large pinch of dried savory or, preferably, a branch of fresh savory, then drained, passed through a fine sieve, seasoned to taste, reheated, and generously buttered; green peas prepared in the same way, but without the savory—they should be freshly picked, but may be more mature than those simply to be boiled or prepared <em>à la française</em>; and <em>soubise</em> sliced new onions—but parboil them first if they are old and strong—gently stewed in butter, bound with a bit of thick <em>béchamel</em> and passed through a fine sieve. All are perfect accompaniments to roast or braised lamb, veal, beef or fowl.</p>

  <p class="indent">Mushroom purées, unlike the other purées, may remain slightly rough in texture.</p>

  <p class="indent">Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a heavy <em>sauteuse</em> or saucepan of the right dimensions to just contain the precooked artichoke bottoms at their ease. Place them, bottoms down, in the pan, cut 2 tablespoons of butter into 6 pieces, place 1 in each of the artichoke bottoms and stew gently, covered, without browning, for about ½ hour, turning them over once or twice.</p>

  <p class="indent">Remove the artichoke bottoms to a preheated serving platter, carefully spoon each full of the mushroom purée, and sprinkle the surface of each with chopped parsley.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="heading_id_6">THE FROZEN STRAWBERRY MOUSSE WITH RASPBERRY PUREE</h2>

  <p class="nonindent">A mousse packed into a soufflé dish too small to hold it, around which has been tied a strip of kitchen paper or aluminum foil rising 2 or 3 inches higher than the brim of the dish, frozen solid, and the paper peeled off just before serving, is called a frozen soufflé, its form being that of a soufflé that has risen high above the borders of the dish. The presentation is elegant, but the firmly frozen, slightly crystallized mass is less pleasant to the palate than the softer and more even-textured mousse described below.</p>

  <p class="indent">A handful of wild strawberries (<em>fraises des bois</em>) scattered over the mousse just before serving is an attractive refinement.</p>

  <p class="indent">Frozen strawberries will not replace fresh, but frozen raspberries, in particular those frozen whole and unsweetened, are excellent.</p>

  <p class="center3">Mousse de Fraises Glacée à la Sauce Melba</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>¾ cup sugar (or more, to taste)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>⅓ cup water</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 quart fresh, ripe strawberries</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 cup whipping cream</em></p>

    <p class="extract"><em>Sauce:</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>1 quart fresh raspberries (or 2 packages frozen)</em></p>

    <p class="bl_hanging"><em>sugar to taste</em> (<em>sweetened, frozen raspberries may need none</em>)</p>
  </div>

  <p class="nonindent">Boil the sugar and water together and let cool. Pass the strawberries through a sieve and mix the purée with the syrup. Pour the chilled cream into a cold bowl, whip it until semi-firm, but not stiff, mix it with the strawberry mixture, and freeze, either in a mechanical ice-cream freezer or in ice trays. If trays are used, scrape the mixture out of the trays into a chilled bowl when half frozen, whip it, and return it to the trays to finish freezing.</p>

  <p class="indent">Pass the raspberries through a nylon drum sieve, and add sugar to taste. Heap the mousse into a chilled crystal bowl and serve the raspberry sauce separately.</p>
