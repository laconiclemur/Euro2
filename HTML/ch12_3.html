<p class="noindenti"><span class="stickup">A</span>s we were growing up, our meals traditionally ended with a dish of seasonal fresh fruits, dried figs, and nuts in their shells. This type of dessert is as good for conversation as it is for digestion. I believe dessert exists so we might stave off the inevitable postprandial depression. A rush of sugar will do this, at least for a time. It is also the one part of the meal, as we showed in <span class="txit">Big Night,</span> that has no real time constraints.</p>
<p class="indenti">And no holiday meal is complete without dessert. Similar to the American tradition of fruitcake at Christmastime, Italians have <span class="txit">panettone</span>. Classic panettone is made with raisins and candied fruit, although it may also be baked with chocolate or cream inside. Fresh panettone is served with a bottle of spumante, a sweeter, less expensive version of champagne. And leftover panettone is eaten over the next few mornings with <span class="txit">caffè latte</span>.</p>
<p class="indenti">The <span class="txit">dolci</span> that follow present the perfect way to end a meal, the most relaxing part of a fine repast.</p>
