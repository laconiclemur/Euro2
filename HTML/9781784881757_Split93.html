<p class="tx2"><b>Our good friend and fellow foodie Anna Hudson and I have had great fun playing with these little beauties, both with the flavours and layering up the colours. <i>Sformati</i> can be served as a <i>primo</i> with cheese sauce; with <i>secondi</i>; or for breakfast. We have given the recipe for making a layered <i>sformato</i> from carrot, cauliflower and spinach as that is our favourite. Most vegetables will work on their own if they have a strong flavour and are not too watery, such as courgette. <i>Sformati</i> are a great way to use up leftover vegetables, especially if they have been steamed <i>al cartoccio</i> (see <a href="9781784881757_Split135.html#page_237">vegetables steamed in paper</a>) as they have such an intense flavour. Our friend Antonella Secciani’s way to make a cauliflower <i>sformato</i> is with sesame seeds in the mould; she serves it with a hearty stew like the <i>peposo</i> on <a href="9781784881757_Split120.html#page_208">slow-cooked beef stew with black peppercorns</a>. The remaining egg yolks can be kept for making the custard on <a href="9781784881757_Split139.html#page_244">apple cake with saffron custard</a> or the <i>fricassea</i> on <a href="9781784881757_Split119.html#page_206">pork tenderloin with flavio’s tuscan ‘dust’</a>.</b></p>
<h4><span class="u">MAKES 8 × 100–150 ML (3½–5 FL OZ) DARIOLE MOULDS OR RAMEKINS</span></h4>
<p class="tx3"><b>FOR THE BÉCHAMEL</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>250 ml (8½ fl oz/1 cup) whole (full-fat) milk</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>30 g (1 oz) unsalted butter</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>1 small bay leaf</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>¼ teaspoon finely grated nutmeg</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt and freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>2 tablespoons cornflour (cornstarch)</b></p>
<p class="tx3"><b>FOR THE SFORMATI</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>unsalted butter, for greasing</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>4 tablespoons sesame seeds (optional)</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>250–300 g (9–10½ oz) cooked spinach, squeezed dry</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>75 g (2½ oz) grated Parmesan or Grana Padano</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>3 egg whites, loosely whisked</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>salt and freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>250–300 g (9–10½ oz) cooked and well-drained cauliflower</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>250–300 g (9–10½ oz) cooked and well-drained carrot</b></p>
<p class="tx3"><b>FOR THE CREAM SAUCE</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>100 ml (3½ fl oz/scant ½ cup) double (heavy) cream</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>75 g (2½ oz) grated Pecorino or Parmesan</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="tx3"><b>TO SERVE</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>25 g (1 oz) pine nuts, toasted, to serve</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>freshly ground black pepper</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>good-quality extra-virgin olive oil</b></p>
<p class="hang"><b>thyme leaves</b></p>
<p class="tx3">To make the béchamel, heat 200 ml (7 fl oz/¾ cup) of the milk in a medium saucepan with the butter, bay leaf, nutmeg, salt and pepper over a medium heat. Mix the cornflour into the remaining 50 ml (2 fl oz/¼ cup) of milk to make a smooth paste, then add this to the warm milk in the pan and stir well with a wooden spoon. Increase the heat and keep stirring until the sauce is thickened, then remove from the heat, discard the bay leaf and set aside.</p>
<p class="tx">To make the <i>sformati</i>, preheat the oven to 170°C (340°F/Gas 3). Grease the dariole moulds generously with butter and place a small circle of baking parchment at the bottom of each one. They can be dusted with sesame seeds at this point, if you wish.</p>
<p class="tx">Put the spinach, a third of the béchamel, a third of the cheese and 1 egg white into a food processor or use a bowl and stick blender. Add a good pinch of salt and a twist of black pepper. Blend until smooth and tip into a bowl. Do the same with the cauliflower and carrot mixtures, using up the remaining béchamel, cheese and eggs. Now divide the spinach mixture between the moulds, followed by the cauliflower mixture and lastly the carrot mixture, then set the moulds on a baking tray.</p>
<p class="tx">Add enough water to the tray to come 2 cm (¾ in) up the sides of the moulds. Bake in the oven for 30–35 minutes or until firm to the touch. Remove from the oven and leave to stand at room temperature for 5 minutes before turning out.</p>
<p class="tx">To make the cream sauce, heat the cream and cheese together in a small saucepan and serve with the <i>sformati</i>. Scatter the <i>sformati</i> with some toasted pine nuts, a twist of pepper, a drizzle of good-quality olive oil and a few thyme leaves.</p>
