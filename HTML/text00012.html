<em>Aubergine stew, my favourite Summer food</em>
</p>
<p class="para">
<strong>The smell of</strong>
 <em>ajabsandali</em>
 <strong>instantly recalls a moment in my youth when I was returning home to Tbilisi at the end of August from a long summer holiday away. The city is very humid and the air smells of hot pavements as we drive through the streets towards home. The whole city feels empty and sad, but upon opening the door to my house, I am immediately met with the fragrant and unmistakable smell of</strong>
 <em>ajabsandali</em>
 : <strong>basil, aubergines (eggplants) and something fresh. My grandmother rushes to greet me at the door. She is flushed and exhausted by the heat, but the twinkle in her eye tells me that she has a surprise for me. I soon found out what it is; our dining table is groaning under the weight of a feast of all of my favourite dishes, prepared to welcome me home. The table is full of fresh herbs, salads of simple cucumber and tomato with pink basil, my favourite cheese and my favourite drinks, and at the centre of it all is</strong>
 <em>ajabsandali</em>
 . <strong>I tell my granny about the summer holidays and everything in the house is quiet and calm. I am home.</strong>

<strong>For the pastry:</strong>
</p>
<p class="side">1 tsp bicarbonate of soda (baking soda)</p>
<p class="side">1 tbsp apple cider vinegar or white wine vinegar</p>
<p class="side">500 g/1 lb 2 oz natural yogurt</p>
<p class="side">2 eggs and 2 egg yolks</p>
<p class="side">100 g/3½ oz butter, melted</p>
<p class="side1">600 g/1 lb 5 oz plain (all-purpose) flour</p>
<p class="side">
<strong>For the filling:</strong>
</p>
<p class="side">150 g/5½ oz butter</p>
<p class="side">2 onions, chopped</p>
<p class="side">3 bunches fresh tarragon (approximately 450 g/1 lb), leaves chopped</p>
<p class="side">2 bunches spring onions (scallions), chopped</p>
<p class="side">3 hard-boiled eggs, diced</p>
<p class="side1">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="side">
<strong>For glazing:</strong>
</p>
<p class="side">1 egg yolk, beaten</p>
<p class="side">1 tsp olive oil</p>
<p class="side1">i tbsp whole milk</p>
<p class="para1">To make the pastry, mix together the bicarbonate of soda (baking soda), vinegar and yogurt in a large bowl. Add the eggs and egg yolk and whisk to combine. Add the melted butter and whisk again. Sift over the flour and bring together to form a soft dough. Knead the dough gently then cover and set aside in a warm place to rest for 2 hours.</p>
<p class="para1">Meanwhile, prepare the filling. Place the butter in a frying pan (skillet) over a medium heat. Once melted and bubbling, add the onions and cook, stirring continuously, for 10 minutes, until soft and translucent. Remove the pan from the heat and stir through all of the other filling ingredients. Set aside for 2 hours to allow the flavours to develop.</p>
<p class="para1">Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas mark 4 and ready a 30 x 40cm/12 x 16-inch baking dish.</p>
<p class="para1">Once the pastry has rested, divide it into 2 pieces, one slightly larger than the other. Working on a lightly floured surface, roll out the larger portion of pastry to line the base and sides of your dish. Spoon the filling into the pastry base. Mix together the ingredients for glazing and brush the edges of the pastry with the mixture.</p>
<p class="para1">Roll out the remaining pastry to fit over the top of the pie, then crimp the edges together and trim any excess pastry. Snip 2 small holes in the top of the pie and brush the pastry with the remaining glaze mixture just before baking.</p>
<p class="para">Transfer the pie to the preheated oven to bake for 30–40 minutes, until golden. Serve hot.</p>
