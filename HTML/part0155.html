<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0000841">I think I was nine when I cooked my first chicken. We had a small oven, like a microwave, so it was very easy for me to look inside and see when the chicken was crispy and juicy. In Spain, there are a lot of places (<em class="calibre9">pollerías</em>) that sell good-quality whole roast chickens to take away – they’re very popular, and you often see families queueing up to get their chicken. Sometimes my parents would pick one up on a Sunday, on their way back from dancing, when it was too late to cook. When I cooked my chicken, I added beer and white wine and lemon. You don’t taste the alcohol: the beer, wine and lemon combine with the juices of the chicken to make a delicious sauce. You can eat a whole loaf of bread by dipping it into this sauce. After I made it, I remember my father saying, ‘How can she make chicken so good?’ Three or four weeks later I tried again and it went wrong. I don’t know why. But I was very disappointed. It’s a good lesson to realize that it’s not always easy to get it right …</p>
<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0000842">Serve with salad, <em class="calibre9">patatas a lo pobre</em> (see <a href="part0157.html#pg214" class="pcalibre calibre3">here</a>) and lots of bread.</p>
