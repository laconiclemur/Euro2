<div class="chapter_opener_text" id="div28">As you drive through the Spanish countryside in November and December, you can see men shaking long sticks into the trees. They scoop up their haul in big plastic sheets on the ground and empty them carefully into deep crates that are stacked at the side of the road. It’s an unglamorous start to one of the most essential ingredients in Spanish cooking: olive oil. The olive harvest is a magical time, when hard black and green olives are transformed into liquid gold. You only have to walk into a pressing room to experience the alchemy of it: the warm wet space is like a steam bath of olive oil that infuses the air, your face, and the entire room.</div>
<div class="chapter_opener_text1" id="div29">You might think that what emerges is the same across Spain and southern Europe. It’s not. Spanish olive oil is much like a fine wine. Its uniqueness comes from the different olive varieties, and the different soils and climates they grow in. For far too long, olive oil has been used as a one-dimensional ingredient with labels telling you only which country it’s from. This doesn’t tell the whole story. For instance, the Catalan region in the north produces fruitier oils that are perfect for salad dressings, while the southern regions produce a more robust oil that is slightly bitter and is better suited for gazpacho. Then there are the different olives, such as Arbequina (which is slightly fruity and is great drizzled over bread that’s been rubbed with tomato) and Picual (which tends to be more woody and is great for frying).</div>
<div class="chapter_opener_text1" id="div30">Since the Phoenicians first planted olive trees on the lberian peninsula, olive oil has been the king of Spanish cooking. In fact olive oil is used so widely and so boldly in Spain that it’s no exaggeration to say that we have more olive oil-based recipes than any other country in the world. Olive oil can be used in very simple ways, such as drizzling it over cheese. Or you can use it to sear fish or shellfish <span class="italic">a la plancha</span>—on a flat griddle top—where the oil acts as a thin film between the food and the metal. It’s also the main ingredient in dressings, acting as an emulsifier in gazpacho or in mayonnaise. Then there’s the olive oil bath: you can submerge just about anything in very hot olive oil to deep-fry it, and you just have to taste a <span class="italic">croqueta</span> <a id="page19"/>to know that Spain (and especially Andalucia) is the center of the frying world. Of course you can always pan-fry, and nothing is more comforting than an egg that has been pan-fried in olive oil. But you can also use oil as you use water: poaching a piece of fish or vegetable in oil at a very low temperature allows you to capture its inner moistness. Olive oil even entered the world of iced desserts when the Adrià brothers invented the olive oil sorbet.</div>
<div class="chapter_opener_text1" id="div31">In Spain we have several traditional olive oil dishes that deserve much more attention from the rest of the world. Among them is <span class="italic">allioli</span>, which is made by smashing a few cloves of garlic into a paste in a traditional mortar. Olive oil is then added very slowly, drop by drop, with a continuous circular movement of the pestle, until you have a very dense, thick sauce. I’ve learned many traditional sauces from many different parts of the world, but <span class="italic">allioli</span> in the Catalan style is one of the most amazing ones because it challenges the basic laws of physics, turning the liquid oil into a solid form with a little garlic and a lot of work.</div>
<div class="chapter_opener_text1" id="div32">That’s why we call it liquid gold. It might look like just another bottle of olive oil, but inside there’s a trove of new techniques, new dishes, and new flavors.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div34"><span class="italic">Allioli</span> is an incredibly popular and versatile sauce that is eaten all across Spain with fish, meat, and vegetables. This recipe is the real thing: <span class="italic">allioli</span> the old-fashioned way, made with a mortar and pestle. In the Catalan countryside, you can still find a few restaurants that go to the trouble of making <span class="italic">allioli</span> this way. It’s perfect on top of the grilled meats and sausages that are at the heart of Catalan cooking. But it’s not just the taste that makes this sauce so incredible–it’s the process. It’s hard to believe that olive oil and garlic can come together to create something so rich and buttery. It may take a bit of work, but a little goes a long way.</div>
<div class="yield" id="div35"><span class="bold"><span class="olive_green">Makes about 1 cup</span></span></div>
<div class="ingredients" id="div36">
<div class="IL_item_top" id="div37">4 garlic cloves, peeled</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div38">1 pinch of salt</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div39">½ teaspoon fresh lemon juice (from about ¼ lemon)</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div40">1 ½ cups Spanish extra-virgin olive oil</div>
</div>
<div class="method" id="div41">Place the garlic in a mortar and add the pinch of salt. Using the pestle, smash the garlic cloves to make a smooth paste. (The salt stops the garlic from slipping at the bottom of the mortar as you pound it down.)</div>
<div class="method1" id="div42">Add the lemon juice to the garlic. Then, drop by drop, add the olive oil as you continue to crush the paste with the pestle. Keep turning the pestle with a slow, continuous circular motion around the mortar as you drip the oil in slowly and steadily. Make sure the paste soaks up the olive oil as you go. Keep adding the oil drop by drop until the sauce has the consistency of a very thick mayonnaise. If your <span class="italic">allioli</span> gets too dense, add ½ teaspoon water to thin it out. This process takes time—around 20 minutes of slow motion around the mortar—to create a dense, rich sauce.</div>

<div class="tip_header" id="div43">José’s tips</div>
<div class="tip_text" id="div44">It’s hard to think, when you start crushing the garlic, that it will ever turn into something as dense and smooth as <span class="italic">allioli.</span> But don’t give up. It’s really worth the time and effort to see the oil and garlic come together. Just make sure you’re adding the olive oil slowly, drop by drop. Keep moving the pestle around the mortar in a circular motion. And keep dreaming of the thick, creamy sauce you’ll have at the end of it all.</div>

<div class="method1" id="div55">Using a hand-held electric mixer, mix at high speed until the garlic is fully pureed into a loose paste. Then, little by little, add the remaining olive oil as you continue blending at high speed. If the mixture appears too thick when you begin adding the oil, add 1 teaspoon water to loosen the sauce. Continue adding the oil and blending until you have a rich, creamy <span class="italic">allioli.</span> The sauce will be a lovely yellow color. Add salt to taste.</div>

<div class="tip_header" id="div56">José’s tips</div>
<div class="tip_text" id="div57">What happens if the oil and egg separate? Don’t throw the sauce out. You can do two things: One is to whisk it and use it as a side sauce for fish or a vegetable. Or if you want to rescue the <span class="italic">allioli</span>, measure out 1 tablespoon lukewarm water and add it to the mix little by little. Blend it again until you have the creamy sauce you wanted.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div59">In the markets and bars of Spain, you find olives everywhere. After all, Spain is the biggest producer of olives in the world. But what makes each olive really distinctive is the <span class="italic">aliño</span>, the mixture of spices and other flavorings that gives the olives their taste. In southern Spain some people buy their olives fresh and cure them for several days before marinating them in their favorite <span class="italic">aliño.</span> But you can buy your favorite cured olives and marinate them in your own <span class="italic">aliño</span> to create something richer and tastier than a storebought marinated version.

<div class="IL_item_top" id="div97">8 extra-large green olives, unpitted (see <a class="hlink" href="Andr_9780770434236_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-tip5">tips</a>)</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div98">4 anchovy fillets (oil-packed)</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div99">2 piquillo peppers</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div100">(Spanish wood-roasted sweet peppers)</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div101">1 garlic clove, unpeeled</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div102">3 tablespoons Spanish extra-virgin olive oil</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div103">Grated zest of ½ orange</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div104">1 tablespoon sherry vinegar</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div105">Sea salt to taste</div>
</div>
<div class="method" id="div106">Using the flat side of a knife, press each olive until the pit pops out, being careful not to split the olive in half. Cut the anchovy fillets lengthwise to create 8 long slices, and cut the piquillo peppers into eight ½-inch-wide strips.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div107">Place 1 anchovy slice and 1 pepper strip in each olive. You can be generous with the filling, allowing the anchovy and pepper to spill out of the olive.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div108">Split open the garlic clove by placing it on a chopping board and pressing down hard with the base of your hand or with the flat side of a knife. In a small bowl, mix the garlic, olive oil, orange zest, and vinegar. Place the stuffed olives in the dressing and allow them to marinate for 30 minutes. Then sprinkle with a little sea salt and arrange them on a plate, with toothpicks for serving.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div113">I’m the biggest oyster eater in the world. Every year, I can’t wait for Oyster Week at two of my favorite D.C. restaurants—The Old Ebbitt Grill and Kinkead’s. They have some of the best oysters I’ve ever eaten: the unique American tiny Olympias and the salty Kumamotos. (Don’t tell anyone, but I wait until mid-afternoon, when the Old Ebbitt serves its oysters at half-price. That way I get to eat twice as much.) Spaniards believe they have the best shellfish in the world, but North American oysters are something irresistible. This recipe is unbelievably popular at my restaurants, and one of my favorites for guests at home.</div>
<div class="yield" id="div114"><span class="bold"><span class="olive_green">Serves 4</span></span></div>
<div class="ingredients" id="div115">
<div class="IL_item_top" id="div116">8 Malpeque oysters (or any other fresh oyster)</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div117">1 lemon</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div118">4 manzanilla olives, pitted and finely chopped</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div119">1 tablespoon small capers (packed in brine)</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div120">1 tablespoon finely chopped shallot (about 1 small shallot)</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div121">1 tablespoon Spanish extra-virgin olive oil</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div122">1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice (from about ½ lemon)</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div123">Grated zest of ¼ lemon</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div124">1 tablespoon finely chopped chives</div>
</div>
<div class="method" id="div125">Bring 1 quart of water to a boil in a large pot. Add the oysters and boil until you see them opening just a fraction, 15 to 20 seconds, depending on the size.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div126">Drain the oysters and place them in a strainer set over a bowl. Open the oysters: Hold an oyster in a towel. Insert the blade of an oyster knife into the “hinge” at the back of the shell. Twist the blade until the hinge pops. Using a small sharp knife, cut upward to sever the muscle that opens and closes the shell. Now carefully insert the knife underneath the oyster to release it from the shell. Be careful not to break the oyster itself. Remove the membrane around the oyster and discard it. Make sure you do this over the bowl so you catch all the juices the oyster releases. Set aside the oysters and the juices.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div127">Cut the ends off the lemon and sit it on a flat surface. Cutting vertically, trim away the skin and pith of half the lemon to expose the flesh. Then slice along the sides of 2 segments and pull out the flesh. Cut each segment into 4 small pieces. Set aside</div>
<div class="method1" id="div128">In a small bowl, mix together the olives, capers, shallot, olive oil, lemon juice, and half the lemon zest. Add the oyster juices and mix together.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div129">Make a bed of the olive mixture on a small plate and place the oysters on top. Place 1 small piece of lemon flesh on top of each oyster. Sprinkle with the chives and the remaining lemon zest. Serve immediately.</div>

<div class="tip_header" id="div130">José’s tips</div>
<div class="tip_text" id="div131">You can leave the oyster membrane, as it’s traditionally served, but I find the membrane has a bitter taste that diminishes the sweet and pristine flavor of the oyster. If you like oysters, I can only imagine how much you’ll love the taste of oysters prepared this way. They really taste like the pearls of the sea.</div>

<div class="headnote" id="div133">I don’t want to be chauvinistic here, but Spaniards are the people who brought cocoa beans back to Europe. By the eighteenth century, the royalty and the aristocracy of Spain were drinking chocolate sweetened with sugar all day long. Chocolate bars as we know them today would come later from central Europe. Spaniards will always have a sweet tooth for chocolate, and this simple dessert is one of the best examples of that—a uniquely Spanish mix of olive oil and chocolate on bread.</div>

The copper adds a characteristic red color to the octopus. Here we may not have the big copper pots, but by adding a penny we can recreate some of the old magic.</div>
<div class="yield" id="div147"><span class="bold"><span class="olive_green">Serves 4</span></span></div>
<div class="ingredients" id="div148">
<div class="IL_item_top" id="div149">2 tablespoons salt</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div150">1 clean copper penny</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div151">1 bay leaf</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div152">1 tablespoon black peppercorns</div>
<div class="IL_item" id="div153">1 whole octopus (about 2 pounds)</div>

<div class="IL_item" id="div157">½ teaspoon <span class="italic">pimentón</span> (Spanish sweet paprika)</div>
</div>
<div class="method" id="div158">Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add the salt, copper penny, bay leaf, and peppercorns. Grab the octopus by the head and dunk it three times just below the head (without scalding yourself!) in the boiling water. Then place the whole octopus in the water and lower the heat to a simmer. Cook uncovered for 1 ¼ hours.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div159">Add the potatoes and cook for another 15 minutes, or until the octopus is tender. You can test for doneness by inserting a toothpick in the thickest part of the tentacle, just as you would with a cake. The toothpick should easily pierce the octopus, with little resistance. Use tongs to remove the octopus and the potatoes from the pot, and set them aside.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div160">Cut the tentacles off the octopus and discard the head. Cut the tentacles into ½-inch pieces.</div>
<div class="method1" id="div161">Slice the potatoes and arrange them in a serving dish. Place the octopus on top. Drizzle with the olive oil and season liberally with sea salt. Place the <span class="italic">pimentón</span> in a fine-mesh sieve, and tapping the side of the sieve gently to break up any large chunks, sprinkle it evenly over the top.

<div class="tip_header" id="div162">José’s tips</div>
<div class="tip_text" id="div163">It’s traditional to dunk the octopus 3 times, but there’s not much difference if you do it more or less. If you don’t want to boil the octopus, go to an Asian market, where you might find the octopus used in Japanese restaurants. Because it’s already cooked, all you need to do is warm it up in a microwave. You can cook the potato on its own and serve the dish in the same way.</div>
