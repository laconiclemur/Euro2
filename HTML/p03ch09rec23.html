</div>
<p class="summary1"><span class="bi">Walking with Michael Jacobs and Manolo el Sereno</span> (<span class="bi">see page 173</span>) <span class="bi">in the village</span> of Frailes, in Jaén, Andalusia, is like walking with Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. Michael is a tall aristocratic-looking Englishman, Manolo a small man of the people. We are stopped by everyone. Michael wrote a book, <span class="italic">The Factory of Light,</span> about the village and spent a long time interviewing the inhabitants. Now that he lives there, they want to go on telling him everything. In the bar carved into the mountain where men sit playing cards in the dark, one man gives him a rabbit, another offers him an armful of wild asparagus he had just picked. They become part of our lunch in his little house on the hill.</p>

<p class="summary">Michael fell for the magic of Spain as a boy and went on to write many learned and witty travel books and guidebooks about the country. He was first drawn to Frailes by the story of the <span class="italic">milagrero,</span> the healer miracle man known as el Santo Custodio, who had lived as a hermit with his goats at the top of a mountain. A shrine and a little church built on the spot are a place of pilgrimage where people pin photos, light candles, and leave gifts. Michael stayed because it was a peaceful place for writing and because he was touched by the friendliness and warmth of the people, who adopted him as one of their own. Unlike Gerald Brenan, who wrote about Spain in the 1940s and ’50s but said little about the food, Michael is a gastronome who writes about the food and takes groups on gastronomic tours.</p>
