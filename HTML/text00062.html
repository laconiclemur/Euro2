<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Twenty-Nine Cookbooks and Counting—All of Them “Pot Boilers”</a>
</h1>
<p class="pf">Each and every book I’ve written has been the result of a special interest of mine.</p>
<p>My first book, <i>The Finnish Cookbook,</i>
 came together after spending a year in Finland and asking questions about the food, living patterns, celebrations, holidays, and differences in the localities around the country. It was published in 1964 by Crown Publishers after having been recommended to Herbert Michelman, the editor in chief, by Proctor Melquist of my then-employer <i>Sunset</i>
 magazine and a personal friend of Herbert. Proc was the head of <i>Sunset</i>
’s publishing system and took a liking to my work, much to my thankfulness. He was a tall, rather gangly man with deep wrinkles on his cheeks and forehead and eyes that seemed to pierce one’s personality. I always felt a little giddy around him—especially the day when I came in with a huge mushroom of a loaf of Finnish Easter bread, which I had baked in a pail. It caught his attention. This rather entertaining shape for a loaf of bread did not please one of the editors in the food department, as she thought it was a bit corny. The recipe was published and was well received by the magazine’s readers.</p>
<p>When we left Menlo Park in the late summer of 1964, I mourned as I would at the funeral of a loved one. But I had to leave, as women did in those days, because my husband, Dick, had just received his PhD at Stanford and had accepted a professorship at the University of Minnesota Duluth. I immediately began to figure out what I could do that was as much fun as working at <i>Sunset</i>
 had been.</p>
<p>
<i>The Finnish Cookbook</i>
 came out about a month later. After much deliberation, I figured I’d try to follow it up with another book. It was much easier to get the attention of a publisher now because my first book had been acclaimed as a success—not because it sold a million or even thousands of books, but primarily because it was original research into an area of the world little known to most. Herbert Michelman at Crown was receptive, so I suggested a cookbook that featured cooking for two.</p>
<p>While I worked at <i>Sunset,</i>
 Dick and I often had special meals for two at home. We did not have the money to entertain ourselves at the number of wonderful restaurants in the Bay Area and San Francisco, so I would just pretend that the meal was being served to us in a cozy little place.</p>

</div>
<p>These meals were always in our student apartment. Cathy and Greg weren’t interested in such things as escargot, candlelight, and special cuts of meat and seafood, so I allowed them to select their own menus and eat wherever they wished. Sometimes it was a picnic under the table or under the Meyer Lemon trees outside the apartment. Then I would set the table with the fanciest of dishes—they really weren’t <i>that</i>
 fancy, although I did splurge on some very unusual dishes at rummage and estate sales—and we’d enjoy a delicious, special dinner for two with a half-bottle of a nice California wine. After we moved to Duluth, I continued our tradition of Saturday night dinners for two, with special kids’ dinners for Cathy and Greg. Thus was born the “gourmet cooking for two” book I proposed to Herbert Michelman. He liked the idea, a contract was signed, and I agreed to finish the book within the year.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we had made new and wonderful friends back in Duluth. It was during the fondue craze of the late 1960s, back when a fondue pot was the ubiquitous wedding gift. We fondued on New Year’s Eve, kids and all, friends bringing their Sterno-fired pots in which we cooked beef tenderloin chunks in hot oil and ate them with special sauces that I made. We fondued on cross-country ski trips and whenever we got together for special occasions.</p>
<p>So I suggested a “fondue menu and party book,” and Michelman again accepted the idea. Another book was on its way, and for it I expanded the technique of fondue to include a number of different menus. I went beyond beef and cheese fondues to cooking everything from chicken, pork, lamb, turkey, seafood, and even tofu in oil. A section on cheese fondue opened the idea for all kinds of dunking sauces: from pizza-flavored to Asian, Mexican, Middle Eastern, and other themes. A third style of fondue emphasized desserts, some of which are still popular today—especially chocolate fondue and fruits. Along with sauces, I included fondue side dishes—salads, breads, appetizers, and desserts—all of which expanded the book into one that had a wide variety of uses. <i>The Complete Fondue Menu and Party Book</i>
 sold all right after its publication in 1972, but it came out just a bit later than the big craze and was not a “barn burner.”</p>
<p>Around that time I had our third child, we had opened our restaurant in Duluth called Somebody’s House, and my time was taken up with everyday duties. I had been called to be a cohost of a locally produced half-hour television show called <i>Holiday House.</i>
 The pay was dismal—in fact, I spent more on babysitting than the seven dollars I got each day to be on the show. Producers of the show had promised me that financial compensation would come from endorsements of products—a promise that never materialized.</p>
<p>Almost a full decade passed before I returned to book writing. Herbert Michelman had by then retired, and my connection to Crown Publishers was gone.</p>
<p>In the seventies <i>Sphere</i>
 magazine had come into being and was being published in Chicago. The editor of the magazine contacted me, and I traveled to Finland with the <i>Sphere</i>
 crew to help them with a whole issue on Finnish foods, arts, and entertaining. I ended up writing most of the magazine’s stories, although I got credit for only one of them.</p>
<p>On that trip we stayed at the Kalastajatorppa, a high-class Helsinki hotel. I was not included in the evening parties, before-dinner drinks, and hors d’oeuvres. Instead, I would take the tram into the center of the city to shop, eat, and explore. For most of the trip, I interpreted for the staff of the magazine while working and became appalled at the crass attitude of the editor and writers, who thought they should get everything for free. They refused to pay for anything, and the Finns were dumbfounded. I found myself apologizing for their rude behavior. I was stupid enough to accept things as they were—and all I got out of the trip was the trip itself. In other words, no pay. The resulting magazine issue from the mid-1970s was gorgeous, even though the model on the cover was German, not Finnish, and some of the fabrics resembled Finnish design, but were also German. I didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>During my hiatus from book writing, I had become fascinated by the food processor and the convection oven. At that time I had been making all our bread at home by mixing the dough in the food processor—baking one loaf at a time. I recognized that this would be a good topic for a book. At the same time, I was using the countertop convection oven in a variety of ways. For these two book project ideas, instead of querying Crown, I reached out to Publications International in Chicago.</p>
<p>Two books followed. I was paid three thousand dollars for each, plus the cost of ingredients, and did not have the rights to the books. The first book was <i>Food Processor Bread Book,</i>
 published in 1980, and the second book came out the same year under the title <i>Convection Oven Cookbook.</i>
 During my time writing these books, our kitchen was a scene of amazement for our kids and their friends as they counted the number of ovens and food processors that had been lent to me by manufacturers. I didn’t get to keep them.</p>
<p>In 1981 I did one of the dumbest things I have ever done: I tried to self-publish a cookbook. For seven years I had been writing a weekly column in the <i>Duluth News Tribune</i>
 under the title “The Liberated Cook.” The “liberation” came from the idea of using the food processor and microwave oven to speed up all things leading to dinner. People still tell me that those are some of their favorite recipes. I was so enthusiastic about the book’s prospects that I had friends lined up to rush more copies to merchants as they ran out of stock! In the end, I didn’t need any “runners,” and the book was something of a bust. I had to borrow money to pay the printing bill—from, of all people, my parents. Did that ever put a guilt trip on me! It took years to clear off that bill, and in the meantime I felt I couldn’t buy anything or spend money on anything extra.</p>
<p>It was time, I thought, to get back into writing books again, so I queried HP Books in Tucson about doing a colorful book on Scandinavian meals. <i>Scandinavian Cooking</i>
 appeared in 1983 and was followed in 1985 by <i>New Ideas for Casseroles.</i>
 Many years later, after those books went out of print, I requested the rights to them. The University of Minnesota Press has republished a number of my cookbooks, minus the photographs.</p>

</p>
<p class="figcap">Baking in my kitchen—something I have been doing since I made my first salt cake at five years of age.</p>
</div>
<p>I had been baking a lot of whole grain breads during these years, so I queried the idea of a book on the subject. In 1984 Dutton published <i>Great Whole Grain Breads,</i>
 featuring a whimsical “fairy godmother” type of character on the cover with warm colors. It was the beginning of the era of healthy whole grain baking as pioneered by the Tassajara bread book, the Moosewood Restaurant books, and others. I included many of my favorite Finnish-influenced breads, as well as Northern and Eastern European styles of breads.</p>
<p>After focusing on whole grain breads, and interested more broadly in the history of American baking, I proposed a book called <i>Great Old-Fashioned American Desserts,</i>
 which Dutton published in 1987. That book was great fun to research, as I had never read much about the history of ingredients such as Eagle Brand milk or Key limes from Florida. The book came out in a most unappealing dust jacket featuring a woman poking a stick into a pie being baked in a woodstove’s oven. I recognized the photo as from a book published on the history of American foods. It had been altered to replace a turkey being baked in the oven with pies.</p>
<p>I was then approached by HP Books to do a book on old-fashioned American cooking. <i>Country Tastes</i>
 appeared in 1988, and in it I managed to use a lot of my favorite recipes from my hometown and recipes gleaned by friends. The University of Minnesota Press republished the book under the title <i>Great Old-Fashioned American Recipes.</i>
 It was the sort of book “down home” types enjoy.</p>
<p>My book <i>Scandinavian Cooking</i>
 was based on typical Scandinavian menus. <i>Scandinavian Feasts</i>
 logically followed and was published by Stewart Tabori and Chang in a large-photo format in 1992. The book was an expensive one for the time. Not long after, the publishers decided to move toward a different type of publishing house, and <i>Scandinavian Feasts</i>
 went out of print. I was offered the opportunity to buy the remaining copies, but the cost would have been equal to our house mortgage at that time, so I bought just a few. The remaining copies were sold to a book remainder company, at which point my royalties stopped. I retrieved the rights to the book, and it was later reprinted, minus the photographs, by the University of Minnesota Press.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, I began a series of books published by Clarkson Potter, an imprint of Crown Publishing under Penguin Random House. Interestingly, Crown was my very first publisher. Recalling my early years in Floodwood and learning to cook, I began collecting nostalgic ideas and recipes from my youth, when we would always bake something special for year-round holidays. I suggested a book along that theme, and that’s how <i>The Great Holiday Baking Book,</i>
 published by Clarkson Potter in 1994, came into being. This was followed by a series of little books, including <i>Light Muffins, Quick Breads, Light and Easy Baking,</i>
 and <i>Pot Pies. Pot Pies</i>
 was a book idea given to me by Clarkson Potter as a peace offering. I had wanted to do a book on favorite cookies, but because Martha Stewart wanted to do a book with the same title, even though she suggested it after I had a contract for it, Martha got to do it. <i>Pot Pies</i>
 was fun to do anyway, and I expanded the idea of pot pies to include many variations and even included innovative recipes.</p>
<p>While writing my next book, <i>Great Whole Grain Breads by Machine or Hand</i>
 (1998), I was talking with my editor at Macmillan about the idea I was hoping to follow up with. I had thought that a book on the topic of “yesterday’s bread” would be charming. Besides, I had so much bread after baking each recipe three or four times that I’d have a volume of “day after” bread recipes. However, that editor left Macmillan and gave the idea to another food writer in her new place of employment. That taught me not to say too much about “good ideas” to anybody!</p>
<p>I had been writing articles for a number of years for the magazine of the Cooking Club of America, based in the Twin Cities, when they suggested a whole cookbook based on poultry. <i>Pure Poultry</i>
 was published in 2000 and was a title in their series of cookbooks covering a wide range of topics. It was a “contract book,” which meant that I was paid a flat fee—no royalties.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I had become addicted to cooking, baking, and roasting in a convection oven, having a range that offered the convection option. I discovered that no book had yet been written specifically for standard-sized convection ovens. All I could find were books written for countertop ovens—even one I had written earlier. But there had been at this time a significant breakthrough in cooking technology based on convection cooking. Commercial kitchens had been using it for years, but it hadn’t taken off for the home cook. My editor, Jennifer Josephy, with whom I had worked when she was at Little, Brown, was so excited about the book that I got a nice advance on royalties. We did a lovely book, without photographs, explaining and giving directions for cooking in a convection oven. My editors got the idea but marketing didn’t. They thought it was an old eighties idea and never pushed the book for the time and energy savings that convection cooking offered. Now, more than ten years later, the book is doing very well.</p>
<p>When I found out that Chronicle Books in San Francisco was interested in a casserole cookbook, the hardest part was trying to think of a good title for it. Brainstorming, I came up with all kinds of crazy names like <i>Under the Lid</i>
 or <i>Cooking Undercover.</i>
 Finally, in desperation, I suggested <i>555 Casseroles.</i>
 Bill LeBlond at Chronicle liked it, but he thought that “555 casseroles were too many”—how about <i>500 Casseroles</i>
? That name was later changed to <i>The Best Casserole Cookbook Ever,</i>
 because the 500 idea sounded too much like the commercial packagers of cookbooks—who collected recipes, untested, from everywhere and enclosed them between the covers of a book.</p>
<p>But how could I come up with so many new recipes? I couldn’t simply develop recipes out of the air—people have to visualize what the final product will be, and some familiarity must be part of it. There needs to be a new twist on the old and familiar. Sometimes that twist is simply a new and quicker way to produce the dish, with an updated feel. Sometimes it means changing the seasoning or making the dish healthier by eliminating sugar, fat, and “artificial” ingredients like canned soup. Sometimes it means switching the protein, vegetable, sauce, or flavor, making it more appealing. My recipes are like children: each is different, each has its own personality, but yet they are identifiable individually—even when they belong to a certain family!</p>
<p>To accomplish 500 casseroles, I first looked up the definition of <i>casserole</i>
 in dictionaries. Here’s what I found:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bqs">Casserole. 1. A stew or moist food dish cooked slowly at a low heat in a covered pot or dish. 2. A deep heavy cooking pot suitable for use in an oven. 3. A porcelain container used for heating food.</p>
</div>
<p>So, I surmised, a casserole is the dish in which the food is cooked or the food cooked in this dish. That could be anything from appetizers to desserts! I ended up with nineteen categories or chapters in the book. I handled each chapter as its own story.</p>
<p>An urge to do my own photography then hit me when I suggested a book I was calling “Mini-Indulgences.” This was published in 2009 as <i>Petite Sweets.</i>
 A photographer friend was eager for a project, and we did the photography at my house. It was fun!</p>
<p>Sellers Publishing then had another idea: a little book called <i>Weeknight Desserts</i>
 in 2010. All of these desserts had to be quick, easy, one-bowl, with minimal hands-on time. That meant that cookies in a recipe, if baked, had to all fit on one pan, use mainly pantry ingredients, and include straightforward instructions.</p>
<p>With all those books under my belt, many people have assumed that I must be a millionaire. I enjoy my life—but I’m not a millionaire! How much do I get from a cookbook? Well, let’s say a book sells for twenty dollars in a bookstore. The bookstore generally buys that book for ten dollars. My contracts allow from seven to ten percent of the wholesale price. From a twenty-dollar book (assuming the bookstore didn’t get a lower price for selling in quantity), my cut ranges from seventy cents to one dollar per book. People often ask me if I would make more if I sold the books myself. Well, yes, that twenty-dollar book would allow me about ten dollars if I sold it myself, although if you buy the same book from a bookstore, it indicates to the bookstore that there is a demand for the book, and consequently the publisher knows it, too. This is probably why clever people who self-publish make a lot more money on each book—but then you need to pay for the printing and production of the book, buy the books, distribute them, advertise them, and handle the sales. It is a lot of work and as much as I enjoy having a bit of money, I am always embarrassed to sell things!</p>

<p>Having written so many cookbooks also means I’m never too far away from questions about this or that recipe. One day I was en route to a wedding shower for my sister and was running late, as usual, with my arms loaded with the lovely Finnish glass platter that was my wedding gift and a ceramic casserole I offered for the potluck. It was April and winter was still all around us, and my heel found one small piece of ice on the pavement. Down I went. The casserole didn’t spill or break, nor did the platter, but my ankle did. A spiral fracture, as I would soon find out. At the time I wasn’t really sure how bad my ankle was, having never suffered such an injury before.</p>
<p>I didn’t miss the party, though, and won most of the game prizes. After cheesecake and coffee, I decided it was time to go to the emergency room just to check things out, as my ankle was really beginning to throb.</p>
<p>I didn’t think my injury was too serious until the doctor said, “We’re going to have to screw your bones back together.” While I was lying on the stretcher waiting to be wheeled into pre-prep for surgery, the nursing staffer poked her head into the cubicle and asked, “Do you, by chance, have a recipe for deep-dish pizza?”</p>
<p>Break a bone and I still can’t get away from cooking questions! This was just the first of many more recipe questions during my stay at the hospital. When I got home with my cast and crutches, we made deep-dish pizza for my homecoming supper.</p>
<p class="psec">I do have to get a word in about promoting cookbooks. From time to time I appear on local television to talk about my “latest book.” But throughout all those books, no memory ever surpasses the blunder I made when promoting my very first book.</p>
<p>When <i>The Finnish Cookbook</i>
 came out in 1964, it was the most exciting time. My first cookbook! And I got to do some promoting. There was a local television station located in the Bradley Building in downtown Duluth. Marian Key hosted a noontime homemakers’ show; she invited me on her program to talk about my new cookbook and demonstrate something from it. She asked me a number of questions about Finnish food traditions. All along I had trouble explaining that Finns have many traditions of their own, even though they do acknowledge good food from other European countries.</p>
<p>Then Marian asked me, “What’s the difference between Finnish meatballs and Swedish meatballs?”</p>
<p>My answer? “Finnish balls are bigger.”</p>
<p>I didn’t realize what I had said, nor did Marian, but the cameramen were practically on the floor laughing. When I got home, Dick said, “Peach, do you know what you said?” Of course I didn’t, but I haven’t been able to live down my stupid comment!</p>
