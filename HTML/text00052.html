<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Two Years at Vocational School</a>
</h1>
<p class="pf">In 1971 I was approached by the Duluth School Board to take a position teaching post–high school students quantity cooking at the Duluth Area Vocational Technical Institute (it is now Lake Superior College and is part of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system).</p>
<p>I accepted the position, but while negotiating my salary I was told that I didn’t need as much money because I was a woman with a husband working full-time at the university and that I was not eligible for the benefits package. I would have to start at a minimal salary. Never mind that I had to drive to the school, sometimes work late into the evening because I was in charge of special events, and that I had babysitting expenses.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I was excited to put some of my teaching skills to work. My goal was to raise the quality of restaurant foods in Duluth.</p>
<p>I shared my work space with the bakery classes that were taught by Dexter Larson, an experienced and affable commercial baker. We taught our classes in one large room full of commercial-sized mixers, sheeters, worktables, and large walk-in coolers. Dexter had been teaching for two years and had worked up a very respectable reputation for his Danish pastry, breads of all kinds, cookies, cakes, and doughnuts.</p>
<p>My job, it turned out, was to provide food for the school cafeteria—it was somebody’s idea of the “perfect” application of the principles of quantity cookery. I was to plan the menus, order the ingredients, and have my students prepare the food for sale. We could not lose money, I was told, so what we took in during the lunch hour had to balance what I spent on ingredients.</p>
<p>The curriculum was to include menu planning, determining food costs, sanitation, meat cutting, and the major techniques of preparation, such as baking, roasting, braising, and broiling. The challenge each day was to provide food that would be sold in the cafeteria at noon to the student body. Needless to say, students did not necessarily have sophisticated tastes.</p>
<p>Besides quantity food preparation and baking, the institute taught various technical courses such as auto mechanics, electrics, architecture, secretarial, and nursing—and I was told “if they can’t handle any of that, they can always cook.” So my class turned out to be an interesting group of characters. There were a couple of serious students and then there were those who showed up hungover in the morning. It was also the beginning of the “druggie” era in Duluth. A couple of students would arrive so high I was afraid they’d fly into an open oven door!</p>
<p>More than one student required an excessive amount of individual attention. Because they varied so much in previous cooking and food experience, I tried to match their skills with their abilities and then determine when they were ready to individually take on more skilled jobs.</p>
<p>Sometimes they would try to get creative: “Teach!” one student questioned as he displayed his creation, “other than looks, taste, and texture, what do you think of it?”</p>
<p>I learned to love them all, even though it was a challenge to accomplish the production every day. Planning quantity menus, ordering the ingredients, and handling the cost of the food served kept me busy daily in the hours after school let out at 4:30. On top of it all, we were expected to plan a couple of major event dinners that were open to the public. This provided me an opportunity to teach such things as ice sculpture, buffet presentation, and the plating of food. That we invited the public to our events added a few more tasks for my students (and me)—mainly advertising, designing dinner tickets, and then selling them. The sale of tickets helped our bottom line, and the students enjoyed these opportunities to “show off” their accomplishments.</p>
<p>After two school years, I was totally exhausted and quit my job. The school board hired two men in my place. I bet they each got twice my salary!</p>

<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Karjalan Paisti (Karelian Three-Meat Stew)</a>
</p>
<p class="rpf">This has been a favorite “go-to” carnivorous main course for a big party. It is really a “recipeless” recipe for a delicious long-roasted stew. I often simply calculate the amount of meat we need based on the number of people we need to serve, figuring on 3 to 4 servings per pound. Then, I figure on about ½ teaspoon salt per pound and an equal weight of sliced onions. As I put it together, I strew in whole allspice and/or whole peppercorns, about a tablespoonful of one or the other (sometimes both). I like to serve this over cooked wild rice, but Dick prefers mashed potatoes. So I offer both. The great thing about this stew is that I can get it ready a day in advance and shove it into a slow oven to roast to juicy succulence in 6 to 8 hours. In my mind, the longer, the better. Oh, and it needs to be cooked in a heavy cast-iron or enameled cast-iron pot to retain the juices.</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpilf">1½ pounds beef stew meat, cut into 1-inch cubes</p>
<p class="rpil">1½ pounds boneless pork, cut into 1-inch cubes</p>
<p class="rpil">1½ pounds boneless lamb, cut into 1-inch cubes</p>
<p class="rpil">4½ to 5 pounds onions, quartered and sliced ¼ inch thick</p>
<p class="rpil">About 4 teaspoons salt</p>
<p class="rpill">About 1 tablespoon whole allspice or black peppercorns</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">Layer the meats with the onions in a heavy 3- to 5-quart casserole or Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid. Sprinkle the meat with the salt and allspice as you go. Cut a piece of parchment paper large enough to cover the entire mixture in the pot, pressing the meats down firmly and tucking the paper down around the edges tightly. Cover with the lid and place in a slow oven, 275°F for 6 to 8 hours or until the meat is very tender. To serve, spoon over mashed potatoes or wild rice.</p>
<p class="rpy">Makes about 12 servings</p>
