<p class="h1"><a id="ch11"/><span class="blue">Sandwich Meats</span></p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Lamb Roll (Lammerull)</span></p>
<p class="noindent8"><i>At Christmas time and other festive days, many Norwegians make their own sandwich meats. Why? Tradition! Once you taste them, you will want to make it a tradition as well.</i></p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg72_02.png"/> </p>
<p class="noindent5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 lbs. (900 g.) lamb flank</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 ½ tbsp. salt</p>
<p class="noindent6">½ tsp. pepper</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 tsp. sugar</p>
<p class="noindent6">½ tsp. ginger</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 ½ tbsp. unflavored gelatin</p>
<p class="noindent2">Carefully remove the thin membrane without cutting into the meat. Trim the meat into a rectangular shape, about an 8-inch (20-cm) long slice. Distribute the excess trimmings evenly in the roll. Mix spices and gelatine and sprinkle over the meat. Roll tightly, beginning with the thickest end of the roll to get an even shape. Fasten with toothpicks and tie securely with cotton thread. Place in a plastic bag in the refrigerator for 24 hours to help the salt and spices become absorbed into the meat before cooking. Wrap in a cloth, cheesecloth, or cotton towel and tie again with cotton thread. Place in boiling unsalted water and let simmer approximately 1 ½ hours. (Timing depends on thickness of roll.)</p>
<p class="indent">When cooked, remove from the water and let rest 10–15 minutes before being placed in a press. Place between 2 small trays with a weight on top, approximately 12 pounds (5 ½ kg.). The roll will <a id="page_73"/>keep in the refrigerator in light brine for about 10 days. It may be frozen before being cooked.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Pork Sandwich <br/>Sausage (Fleskepølse)</span></p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg73_01.png"/></p>
<p class="noindent2">A sausage with the consistency similar to liver paté. Served with dark bread, butter pickles, or pickled beets.</p>
<p class="noindent5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 lb. (450 g.) veal</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 ¼ tbsp. salt</p>
<p class="noindent6">¾ lb. (340 g.) pork, lean</p>
<p class="noindent6">½ tsp. nutmeg, freshly grated</p>
<p class="noindent6">¼ lb. (115 g.) pork fat</p>
<p class="noindent6">¾ tsp. ginger</p>
<p class="noindent6">½ cup (1 ¼ dl) onion</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 ¾ tsp. pepper</p>
<p class="noindent2">Grind meat, fat, and onion well together. Place in a mixing bowl and beat for 5 minutes. Add spices and salt, and beat another 2–3 minutes. Stuff sausage casings and tie off securely. Place in a kettle with near boiling water. Leave them in this water until they expand and look tight and the fat melts. Remove to another pan with boiling water. Keep the water close to the boiling point for 20 minutes. Remove from heat and place in cold water. Keep turning the sausage in the water so that the melted fat is distributed evenly and solidified in an even layer underneath the sausage casings. Refrigerate. Spread on sandwiches.</p>
<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Pressed Headcheese (Persesylte)</span></p>
<p class="noindent8"><i>Sylte may be served as a main course with boiled potatoes and pickled beets; most often, however, it is used as pålegg—sandwich meat.</i></p>
<p class="noindentt2">As I reminisce, I can see Mamma working on a pig’s head, preparing our Christmas <i>sylte</i>. As a child it was always a puzzle to me, why the placing of a heavy object on the headcheese could make it so delicious.</p>
<p class="noindent5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">½ pig’s head</p>
<p class="noindent6">Boiling water</p>
<p class="noindent6">1–2 tbsp. salt</p>
<p class="noindent6">8–10 peppercorns</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 bay leaves, optional</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 lbs. (900 g.) veal shoulder</p>
<p class="noindent5">Filling:</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 tbsp. salt</p>
<p class="noindent6">½ tsp. peppercorns</p>
<p class="noindent6">¼ tsp. cloves</p>
<p class="noindent6">¼ tsp. allspice</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 tbsp. gelatin, optional</p>
<p class="noindent2">Clean the pig’s head thoroughly and soak in cold water overnight. It can soak as long as 2 to 3 days, but in that case the water should be changed often. Place head in boiling water to cover, together with salt, peppercorns, and bay leaves. When it has boiled about 1 hour, lift from water and remove all the rind. Keep it warm. Continue cooking head until meat is tender, preferably with a little added rind. Simmer veal shoulder separately. Soften gelatine in a little water. Gelatin may be omitted if as much veal is used as called for in the recipe. Mix salt and spices. When the head is cooked remove meat and fat and keep separate. Remove all meat-colored spongy spots, <i>eitel</i>—small lumps in the meat. Dip a piece of strong cheesecloth in warm water, wring out, and place in a pan or bowl. Arrange a layer of rind in the bottom and sides. On top of this put strips of pork fat, making sure edges meet, but do not overlap. Sprinkle with spices. Layer fat, pork, and veal—beginning and ending with fat—and sprinkle spices between each layer. (If gelatin is used soften and spoon between layers.) Cover all with a layer of rind. Wrap cloth tightly around the head cheese and sew together with needle and thread. Return to the broth in which the head was cooked and heat thoroughly, about½ hour. Remove from boiling water, drain, and return to the pan in which it was formed. Place a fairly heavy object on top but not so heavy that <a id="page_74"/>too much juice and fat is forced out. After an hour or so add enough extra weight that the head cheese will be squeezed into the desired shape, will be firm, and will hold together when sliced. Cool as quickly as possible and leave a weight on overnight. Soak in brine about 2 to 4 days.</p>

<p class="h1b"><span class="red">Pickled Pork Loaf (Sylte)</span></p>
<p class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/pg74_01.png"/> </p>
<p class="noindent5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">3–4 lbs. (approx. 1,800 g.) pork shoulder when</p>
<p class="noindent6">deboned</p>
<p class="noindent6">½ tsp. pepper</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 tsp. allspice</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 tsp. salt</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 tsp. cloves, or more</p>
<p class="noindent2">Do not remove rind or fat from pork. Fill a large heavy-bottomed pan with water, bring to a boil, and add salt, 1 tsp. per quart (liter) of water. Stir until dissolved. Add pork and let simmer 1 ½–2 hours or until tender. Rind may become cooked before meat. If the tip of a spoon penetrates the rind is done. Then carefully remove rind from the meat, and if necessary continue cooking meat until done. In the meantime combine spices and salt. Line a pan (square, round, or loaf) with a cloth which has been wrung out in warm water. Work with the pork as soon as it has been removed from the boiling water. Place a layer of rind on the bottom and sides of the pan, making sure the edges meet but do not overlap. Slice lean meat and fat separately and place in alternate layers beginning and ending with fat. Arrange any small pieces in the center of the <i>sylte</i>. Sprinkle mixed spices between each layer. Cover <i>sylte</i> with rind and fasten with toothpicks, or sew together with needle and heavy cotton thread. It should be about 5 inches (12 ½ cm) thick when sewn together. Wrap cloth tightly around and secure with string. Return to water in which the meat was boiled and let simmer about 30 minutes, or until heated through. Remove from boiling water, remove cloth, and drain. Stud with whole cloves 1 inch (2 ½ cm) apart. Return to pan in which it was formed and place a fairly heavy weight on top, but not so heavy that too much of the fat and juice is forced out. After an hour or so add enough extra weight that the <i>sylte</i> will be squeezed into desired shape, be firm, and hold together when thinly sliced. Cool as quickly as possible and leave weight on overnight. Loosen cloth and scrape off any fat or juice. Soak in brine for 2–4 days. If only part of <i>sylte</i> is used at this point, again secure in a cheesecloth and return to brine, but for no longer than 7 days. Keep refrigerated after removal from brine.</p>

<p class="h1bb"><span class="red">Liver Paté (Leverpostei)</span></p>
<p class="noindent5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 lb. (450 g.) pork liver</p>
<p class="noindent6">¾ lb. (340 g.) fresh pork fat cut into 1/8-inch (5-mm) thick strips</p>
<p class="noindent6">8 oz. (225 g.) pork fat</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 onion, small</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 ½ tsp. salt</p>
<p class="noindent6">4 anchovies (Scandinavian) and some liquid</p>
<p class="noindent6">1/8 tsp. pepper</p>
<p class="noindent6">½ tsp. allspice, optional</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 eggs</p>
<p class="noindent6"><a id="page_75"/>¼ tsp. ground cloves, optional</p>
<p class="noindent6">2 tbsp. flour</p>
<p class="noindent6">½ tsp. sugar, optional</p>
<p class="noindent6">1 cup (2 ½ dl) coffee cream</p>
<p class="noindent2">Wash and dry the liver and cut into chunks. Coarsely chop the pork fat, onion, and anchovies and combine with the liver and 2 tablespoons anchovy liquid. Grind 4 or 5 times. Or divide the mixture into fourths and purée each batch in an electric blender set on high speed, or run through a kitchen machine. Transfer each completed batch to a large bowl. Beat the eggs with  flour, coffee cream, and spices and add to meat mixture a little at a time. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a 1-quart mold or loaf pan with the strips of pork fat, making sure they overlap slightly and fully cover the bottom and sides of the pan. Spoon the liver mixture into the mold and top with additional pork fat strips. Cover with heavy aluminum foil, sealing the edges tightly. Place in a large baking pan and add enough boiling water to the pan that it reaches at least halfway up the sides of the mold. Bake in the center of the oven from 1 ¼–1 ½ hours. Remove from the oven and lift off the foil. When it has cooled to room temperature remove from pan and wrap in aluminum foil. Refrigerate.</p>
