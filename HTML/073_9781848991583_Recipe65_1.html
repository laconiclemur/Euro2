<p class="normal"><b>Belgian endive is a very versatile vegetable and while it is perfect raw in a salad, it also tastes delicious baked in a tart. Here, it is combined with orange juice, a drop of honey and fresh thyme, which lift the Belgian endive to new heights. The orange zest and walnuts sprinkled over the top to finish the dish beautifully.</b></p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">SERVES</span></b> 4</p>
<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 25 minutes, plus 30 minutes chilling and 20 minutes cooling</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 1 hour</p>
<p class="acktxt">5 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing</p>
<p class="acktxt">9 ounces puff pastry dough, thawed if frozen</p>
<p class="acktxt">all-purpose flour, for dusting</p>
<p class="acktxt">6 heads Belgian endive, trimmed and halved lengthwise</p>
<p class="acktxt">finely grated zest and juice of 1 orange</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons honey</p>
<p class="acktxt">¼ teaspoon thyme leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">¼ cup walnuts, chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 tablespoons chopped celery leaves</p>
<p class="acktxt">¼ apple, peeled, cored and diced</p>
<p class="acktxt">sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Lightly grease an 8-inch loose-bottomed tart pan. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured countertop until it is 10 inches across and ⅛ inch thick. Use it to line the bottom and side of the tart pan, gently pressing it into the edges without overstretching the dough. Trim any excess dough, prick the botom with a fork and chill 30 minutes to prevent the dough shrinking during baking.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Meanwhile, make the filling. Melt slightly less than 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the Belgian endives, cut-side down, and cook 4 to 5 minutes until lightly colored. Take care not to let the butter burn. Pour enough water into the pan to fill by ½ inch, then add the remaining butter. Pour in the orange juice, season with salt and pepper and stir to combine. Cover the Belgian endives with a <i>cartouche</i> (see <a href="140_9781848991583_KitchenTerminology.html#pageid_218">page 218</a>), turn the heat down to very low and simmer 35 to 40 minutes until they are very tender and caramelized. Check occasionally to make sure the mixture is not burning and add more water, if necessary.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> While the Belgian endives are cooking, heat the oven to 325°F. Line the pastry case with parchment paper and cover with baking beans. Bake 12 minutes, then remove the paper and baking beans and bake 3 to 5 minutes longer until the pastry is cooked and just golden. Remove the tart pan from the oven and leave the pastry case to to cool in its pan on a wire rack. Turn the oven up to 400°F.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Lift the Belgian endives out of the pan and place on a clean dish towel to dry, then leave to cool. Add the honey and thyme to the pan and warm through, gently stirring, until you have a light syrup. Remove the pan from the heat.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> When the Belgian endives have cooled, lay them tightly together in the pastry case, then brush generously with the orange-honey syrup. Bake 10 to 12 minutes until the tart is warmed through. Remove it from the oven and the pan. Scatter the walnuts, orange zest, celery leaves and apple over the top and serve warm.</p>
