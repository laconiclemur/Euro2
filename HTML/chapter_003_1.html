<h2 class="h2-a">Bouillabaisse and Other Stories</h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="smallcaps">THIS CHAPTER IS</span> a celebration of Provence’s best-known dishes, among them <em>salade niçoise, pissaladière</em>, and the tomato- and orange-scented <em>daube de boeuf</em>. But the most legendary of them all is the famous bouillabaisse.</p>
<p class="normala">Just a mention of bouillabaisse stirs up a powerful image for anyone who loves to eat. Richly scented, bright with saffron and the orange-red of its rockfish, everything about a good one conjures up visions of a Provençal feast. The name, evocative as it now may be, has more practical origins, thought to come from the Provençal <em>boui</em> (to boil) and <em>baisser</em> (to lower). With a little imagination this could be the very short, original recipe, ‘Boil your broth, add your fish and lower the heat.’ Which is exactly how Marseillais fishermen would make it: on the beach over a driftwood fire, where the remains of their catch too small, spiny or ugly to sell were cooked in salt water and olive oil. A fish would have earlier been swapped for some tomatoes and fennel for flavour, and thick chunks of bread served as both plates and second course.</p>
<p class="normala">Today bouillabaisse is a dish which all over Provence is the root cause of more arguments than any other. These feisty discussions are often better than the soup itself. I love to listen, watch and only join in as cheekily as possible when things show signs of slowing down. A foreigner participating at all gets the eyes bulging and the corks popping. More so if I mention my more recent refinements. Yes, I fillet the fish first! Of course I cook it in the oven! <em>Gambas</em>? As many as possible! Given a chance I describe my first bouillabaisse.</p>
<p class="normala">In Marseille, nineteen years old, brimming with excitement, I went out early to watch the fishermen bring in their catch and their wives arrange it on their shaded seaweed- and ice-filled tables. Sparkling daurade rose and loup de mer for grilling lay alongside huge chapons for stuffing, sardines for marinades and tiny rockfish for <em>la soupe</em>. Each fisherman seemed to have unearthed a treasure too. On one table was a huge spider crab with its legs roped; on another a flat tank-like <em>cigale de mer</em> and a basket of wrinkled <em>violets</em>, a mollusc scented more strongly of the sea than any oyster. On yet another, a dead-looking octopus which wrapped itself around my arm and gave rise to an almighty cackle from the surrounding fishwives while scaring me senseless and momentarily putting me off the idea of prodding everything, as I thought was so expected at any French market. Each sale is a social event: first the recipe is discussed and the relative merits of each fish are compared (somewhat cagily in case a better choice is spotted at a rival’s table). The fish is scaled and gutted, sometimes filleted, and the carcasses are kept for soup or stock, if not thrown to the seagulls that lurk hopefully all around. The larger fish to be cooked whole are stuffed full of dried wild fennel stalks that are in boxes underneath each table.</p>
<p class="normala">My booking at the restaurant where I was sent by the tourist office (first mistake) was at 1 pm. I went back to the youth hostel and changed carefully into my good trousers and shirt which I’d put under my mattress to press the night before. I ordered a <em>pastis</em> and looked at the different options for my bouillabaisse while counting my money under my napkin. I had just enough, and asked for a half lobster with my bouillabaisse. I very carefully went through what I wanted with the waiter and settled into my aperitif and olives.</p>
<p class="normala">The bouillabaisse arrived with the sort of proud panache that only the French can muster. It also arrived with half a <em>langouste</em> in place of half a <em>homard</em> sitting on top. A <em>langouste</em>, being a rock lobster, is the traditional crustacean in a bouillabaisse, but I didn’t care I wanted my claw. I pointed this out – he of course pointed out that I was wrong, and not French, let alone Marseillais, and therefore ignorant. Neither wanting nor really having the language to be able to get into a great discussion about it all I said okay and made a saddened start to my bouillabaisse. The fish itself was stringy and cold. The <em>langouste</em> had the texture of cotton wool. The soup was so overpoweringly fishy that after a few spoonfuls I was beaten. I paid my bill, weathered the sneer of the waiter and walked back along the port where the fishermen’s wives were long finished.</p>
<p class="normala">The next bouillabaisse I ate was a couple of years later. At the end of a season cooking in the Alps, I caught a lift to the south of France with a few friends, one of whom, Laurent, had a father with a restaurant in Gassin. This bouillabaisse was the real thing, not just in the eating but in the anticipation. Laurent’s father showed us all of the fish early in the morning, took me through the different types – the <em>chapons, rascasses, vives, congers</em>, the multi-coloured <em>wrasse</em> and lively little crabs known as <em>étrilles</em>. There was a big box of the tiny versions of all these fish destined for the <em>soupe de poisson</em>, a mixture so colourful it was like looking through a kaleidoscope.</p>
<p class="normala">The fish were picked free of twigs but not seaweed and just rinsed, not cleaned. We helped him scale and empty the larger fish, instructed to be careful and keep the intensely flavoured livers for the <em>rouille</em>. He then cut off all the heads, slicing at an angle just behind the gills to get the maximum of flesh at the thickest part of the fish.</p>
<p class="normala">(I remembered Laurent once ridiculing another of the chefs in the Alps, completely disgusted because he had put carrots in a ‘so-called’ bouillabaisse. Seeing the care with which this one evolved, I began to understand the importance.)</p>
<p class="normala">The <em>soupe de poisson</em> went on to cook and we were given a basket of crudités, <em>anchoïade</em>, and some young red wine to whet our appetites while it cooked. We dipped young spring onions and finely sliced, lemon-rubbed baby artichokes, and played boules in the courtyard while the soup cooked inside. Laurent’s dad started a wood fire next to the restaurant over which he hung a blackened cauldron. He poured in the rich fennel- and orange-scented soup, sprinkled over a small amount of saffron – ‘Not too much, guys, or it’ll taste like medicine’ – and put the soup on to cook. He enquired after our game, watched a few throws and had a laugh at my amateurish efforts, then went back to his kitchen to get the fish. He filled the pot with the firmer fleshed fish in the bottom over the crabs then layered up the other fish and potatoes.</p>
<p class="normala">An hour or so later we went over to the terrace, which overlooks first vines and then the sea. We opened another few bottles of the young red, and Papa arrived with the bouillabaisse. The fish and crabs had been joined by small but plump mussels and were laid out in an enormous, hollowed piece of cork. The soup had been thickened with <em>rouille</em> and was ladled, steaming, from a huge tureen. There were croûtons and more <em>rouille</em> in a few sandy mortars. The next hour was not wasted on talk. Eyes and mouth went from fish to soup, and a sip of wine preceded a lingering glance at the sea. My three French friends later marvelled at my capacity, having finished long before I did. I explained that I’d had a memory to erase before I started anew, and we returned to the courtyard for another game of boules. The following is more or less the same recipe.</p>
