<p class="normal"><b>Imagine all the colors and flavors of these lovely summer berries in a rosemary-infused clafoutis. And the individual clafoutis are really just as good made with thyme or lavender flowers, but make sure the flowers are edible and untreated. Another great flavor combination is crushed black pepper and grated lime zest—enjoy experimenting!</b></p>

<p class="acktxt"><b><span class="smallcaps">PREPARATION TIME</span></b> 15 minutes, plus 1 hour macerating</p>
<p class="acktxta"><b><span class="smallcaps">COOKING TIME</span></b> 12 minutes</p>
<p class="acktxt">⅓ cup blueberries</p>
<p class="acktxt">⅓ cup blackberries</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup red currants</p>
<p class="acktxt">⅓ cup cherries, pitted</p>
<p class="acktxt">⅓ cup strawberries, hulled and quartered</p>
<p class="acktxt">scant ½ cup sugar</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ teaspoon very finely chopped young rosemary leaves (from the tips)</p>
<p class="acktxt">4 tablespoons plain Greek yogurt</p>
<p class="acktxt">3 tablespoons unsalted butter, half soft and half melted</p>
<p class="acktxt">½ cup all-purpose flour, sifted a pinch salt</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 egg</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 egg yolks</p>
<p class="acktxt">¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons whole milk</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> Wash the fruit, drain it well and put it into a bowl. Add 2 tablespoons of the sugar and the rosemary and turn to coat. Cover and leave the fruit to macerate at room temperature 1 hour to release some of the juices from the fruit.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Heat the oven to 350°F. Strain the fruit and add half of the juices to the yogurt, reserving the other half. Mix the juices into the yogurt, then cover with plastic wrap and chill until ready to serve.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Grease four large ramekins with the soft butter and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of the sugar, carefully turning the ramekins to make sure the sugar coats the insides, then tip out any excess.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Sift the flour and salt into a mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg, egg yolks and remaining sugar, then slowly add to the flour, mixing until incorporated and smooth. Gradually add the milk and the reserved fruit juices, stirring until the mixture has the consistency of a crepe batter, then add the melted butter and mix well until combined.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> Divide the berries into the prepared ramekins and pour the batter over to just below the top. Bake 10 to 12 minutes until the clafoutis are set and golden brown. Serve with a dollop of the flavored Greek yogurt on top, if you like, or you can serve it separately.</p>
