Add the reserved shrimp stock, and cook 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes, olives, and black pepper, and cook over high heat another 30 seconds. Watch the shrimps carefully; they should be tender and succulent, not rubbery. If you have any doubt, stop the cooking by quickly adding the pasta. Turn the heat down to medium. Add the drained hot pasta to the skillet, and toss with lemon juice to taste. Add salt as needed. Turn the pasta into the warmed bowl, and serve in heated soup dishes.

Tortellini in broth mark Sunday dinners, holidays and special occasions. They evoke memories of mothers and grandmothers who cooked like angels</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Today in America commercially produced tortellini are so commonplace, you might think I exaggerate in telling you how marvelous homemade ones can be. But pure ambrosia is a bowl of your own handmade tortellini floating in homemade broth</span>.</p>

Enveloping it in Villa Gaidello’s pasta, flavored with Parmigiano-Reggiano, nutmeg, and pepper, makes these tortellini even more distinctive.

Filled tortellini can be refrigerated, covered with a towel, up to 12 hours. They freeze successfully up to 3 months. Freeze the pastas spread out on baking sheets.

<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="Images/135a.jpg"/></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Filling:</span> In a food processor fitted with the steel blade, grind the steak very fine. Transfer it to a medium-size glass or stainless steel bowl. Place the mortadella and prosciutto in the processor, and grind very fine. Add to the bowl along with the 1 cup of Parmigiano-Reggiano. Blend the ingredients into a stiff paste, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">If working by hand, finely chop the meats until they are almost a paste. Blend in the cheese, cover, and refrigerate.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Shaping the Tortellini:</span> Work with a quarter of the dough at a time, keeping the remainder loosely wrapped in plastic. Stretch and thin, by hand or by machine, until you can detect the color of a ball of the filling through the dough (see Pastas). Divide the sheet in half, and cover both halves with plastic wrap to keep them from drying out.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Cut one sheet into 1¾-inch rounds, using a small glass or a biscuit cutter. Cover the rounds to keep them from drying out. Make little crescents with ¼ teaspoon of the filling. Place a crescent in the center of each round, fold the dough over, and tightly pinch the edges together to seal thoroughly. Then bring the tails of the crescent together, overlapping them, and twist one over the other. Seal well so that you have tiny doughnut shapes, with the sealed edges curving over the filling. Spread the finished tortellini on flat baskets or baking sheets covered with kitchen towels, taking care to not let them touch. Continue working until the sheets of dough are used up. Leave the tortellini uncovered as you work. Turn them over after an hour or so to keep them from getting soggy. Dry any dough scraps to use in soups, and where maltgliati are called for.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Roll out the remaining dough (still working with only a quarter at a time), and repeat the process until all the dough is used up. Any leftover filling could be frozen for future use and is delicious stuffed into flattened chicken breasts.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Cooking and Serving:</span> Have a tureen and soup dishes warming in a low oven. Turn the stock into an 8- to 10-quart pot and bring to a boil. Season with salt and pepper. Drop in the tortellini and cook a minute or two. Then taste one. Fresh tortellini will cook in 2 to 5 minutes. They should be tender but still have some “bite,” or firmness. Drier or frozen tortellini will take a little longer. Ladle the broth and tortellini into the warmed tureen. Pass the extra Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese for sprinkling over the soup as a final and vital seasoning.</p>

<p class="bibliographyEntry" style="text-indent: -5%;"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Suggestions</span>   Wine:</span> The meaty flavors of Tortellini in Broth are too complex for anything but a fresh, bright, grapy red. In Emilia-Romagna, Lambrusco is the wine of choice for tortellini. Here, seek out a dry red Freisa d’Asti or “La Monella” of Braida di Giacomo Bologna from Piemonte, a fruity white Piemontese Arneis, or Sicily’s white Rapitalà.</p>
</div>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Menu:</span> In Romagna and southern Emilia, Christmas, weddings, and feast days begin with Tortellini in Broth; then two or three other pastas are served in progression. After a pause, Christmas Capon and vegetables come to the table. Desserts are likely to be Paola Bini’s Sweet Ravioli or an assortment of baked tartlets, Home-Style Jam Cake, turnovers, and “Keeping Cakes” like the ones found in Second Courses. For a simpler elegant menu have the tortellini, then Balsamic Roast Chicken, Sweet Fennel Jewish Style, and Torta Barozzi for dessert.</p>

Drop in the tortelloni. If very fresh they will be ready after boiling no more than 1 minute or so. If they have waited several hours, they could boil up to 4 minutes. Taste one to be sure that their edges still have a little resistance or “bite.” Lift the pastas from the water with a large skimmer, and place them in the heated serving bowl or individual dishes.

<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">A Bolognese Fantasy</span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">In Italy, an improvised dish not following any established tradition is called a <span class="italic">fantasia</span>, or fantasy. These tortelloni were the fantasy of Tamburini, Bologna’s fancy food emporium. Tamburini’s windows are always crammed with the kind of home-style dishes that make you consider giving up on your own cooking altogether. While walking past the shop one autumn morning, I eyed a platter of big tortelloni stuffed with artichokes, mascarpone, and fresh white truffles. It looked too good to resist. I bought several and carefully peeled back the fresh pasta to taste the filling. It was splendid. Italy’s white truffles are pungent with scents of garlic and earth. Combining them with artichokes, creamy mascarpone, the flintiness of Parmigiano, and a hint of lemon was pure genius. The combination stayed with me. After toying with all sorts of formulas, I finally came close to reproducing the one I tasted from Tamburini. Some adjustments were necessary. Fresh white truffles are not easy to come by on this side of the Atlantic, hence the hint of garlic. Basil softens the garlic’s edge, sparks the artichokes, and accentuates the mascarpone’s natural sweetness.</p>

Cut no more than about five at a time to keep the dough from drying out.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Place a generous spoonful of filling (a ball about 1¼ to 1½ inches in diameter) in the center of each square. Fold the squares in half, forming triangles, and forcing out the air as you seal the edges together (moisten the edges with a little water if necessary). Then form an oversize tortellino by bringing the two ends together, folding one over the other, and sealing them. Place them on towel-lined baskets or baking sheets without touching. Pull back the plastic wrap on another third of the pasta, and cut more squares. Continue filling and shaping until done.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Cooking and Serving:</span> Melt the butter with the sage leaves in a small saucepan. Set aside and keep warm. Warm a serving bowl and shallow soup dishes in a low oven. Bring the salted water to a vigorous boil. Drop in the cappellacci, and cook about 3 minutes at a full boil, or until the edges of the pasta are tender but still firm to the bite. These are too fragile to drain in a colander. Instead, turn off the heat, and use a big skimmer or large flat slotted spoon to gently scoop out the cappellacci, pulling about a third from the water. Work quickly so as not to overcook the pasta. Drain the water from the pastas by holding the skimmer over the pot a few seconds. Then slip them into the warmed serving bowl. Quickly sprinkle with about a third of the melted butter and a third of the Parmigiano-Reggiano. Repeat the process, making another two layers. Season lightly with pepper if desired, and serve immediately. (The dish could be garnished with a few fresh sage leaves.)</p>

<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">One True Recipe?</span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">The word <span class="italic">cappellacci</span> comes from <span class="italic">cappello</span> (hat), supposedly inspired by the tricornered hats of Napoleon’s time. I think they more closely resemble men’s hats of the 15th and 16th centuries, when plumped crowns and soft-turned brims were fashionable. Certainly their play of sweet against savory is straight out of that time—such a perfect dish for Ferrara, where it often feels as if the town clock stopped somewhere in the mid-1500s. The first written recipe for cappellacci with sweet squash appeared around 1584, but historians think the dish had already existed for many years. Possibly true, as illustrations of squashes resembling the ones used today are found in northern Italian medical handbooks of the 14th century.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">The idea of a sweet/savory squash filling spread from Ferrara to her neighbors. Just across the Po River, squash-filled pastas are eaten in the city of Mantua. There, square-shaped pastas served as a first course are stuffed with squash, Parmigiano-Reggiano, crumbled amaretti cookies, and sometimes <span class="italic">mostarda di Cremona</span> (whole candied fruits in spiced syrup). Modena, Ferrara’s Emilian neighbor to the west and long under her rule, eats squash-filled pastas only on Christmas Eve. Parma has almost the same filling as Ferrara, but in a tamer casing—rectangular <span class="italic">tortelli di zucca</span>. Reggio’s filling resembles Parma’s, sometimes adding amaretti—an ingredient not worried over in Mantua, but whose validity is heatedly debated by Emilians. As you roam Emilia and Romagna, you will find raisins added here, pine nuts there, and even tart/sweet grape syrup stirred into some renditions. Only two constants prevail: the pastas are always served as a first course, and dispute never ceases over the one “true” recipe.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Melt the 7 tablespoons butter in a heavy 3½- to 4-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion, carrot, and celery, and then the beef. Lightly salt and pepper the meat. Slowly brown the beef on all sides over medium to medium-low heat about 30 minutes, building a foundation of deep flavors. The meat should be a deep, crusty brown. Add the cloves, the tomato paste, water, and enough stock to barely cover the meat (more will be needed later). Heat until the broth bubbles very, very slowly. Cover with a doubled piece of parchment paper that has a slit about 3 inches long cut in the center. Then partially cover the pan with the lid.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Pour ¼ cup of the wine over the slit every hour or so until the 2 cups are used up. Keep the heat low so the liquids bubble very slowly. Cook about 9 hours, turning the meat two or three times. Then remove the lid, but leave the parchment, and simmer another 3 hours, spooning in more stock to keep the meat barely covered with liquid. At this point the meat can be refrigerated overnight. The next day, continue cooking with only the slitted parchment on top 4 to 6 hours, or until the meat literally falls apart when touched with a fork.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Turn the contents of the pan into a strainer, and press on the meat with the back of a large spoon, extracting as much of its juices as possible. Then discard the meat, as all its flavor is now in the cooking juices. Turn the juices back into the saucepan and boil down, 10 to 15 minutes, to about 1 to 1¼ cups.

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Cut the dough into strips about 3½ inches wide. Protect the strips from drying by covering them with plastic wrap. Pull back the wrap on about 6 to 8 inches of a strip, and dot the dough about 1 inch in from the edge with a row of ½-teaspoon mounds of filling. Space them about 1 inch apart. Fold the dough over and seal around each mound, pressing out air pockets as you go. If the dough seems dry, dip your finger in water and moisten around each mound before folding the pasta over. Use a 1½-inch diameter glass or round cutter to cut out each anolino. (They can also be cut as half moons.) Spread them out on the baskets without touching. Repeat the process until the pasta and filling are used up.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Cooking and Serving:</span> Have a tureen and shallow soup dishes heating in a low oven. Bring the 2½ quarts stock to a vigorous boil, tasting to see if it needs salt and pepper. Add the anolini to the broth and boil 3 to 10 minutes, depending upon how dry they are. Taste for doneness; the edges should be a little chewy. Serve in the warmed tureen or ladle into soup dishes.

Just large enough to hold the pot roast snugly, it has a porous concave lid where the wine is placed so that it may slowly seep over the meat. Professor Capacchi describes his mother covering the meat with a cracked plate that served the same purpose, allowing wine to seep through the crack, slowly basting the meat. If you have a plate that has a crack in the middle, do wash it well and use it.</p>
</div>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">My improvised <span class="italic">stracottiera</span> is done with a heavy saucepan large enough to hold the meat snugly and a double thickness of parchment paper with a slit in the middle. This may be fanaticism on my part, but the fragrance of the wine slowly evaporating <a id="page152"/>on the warm paper and over the meat, mixed with the meat’s aromas, fills the house with such wonderful smells that the little extra effort is highly worthwhile—a lovely bonus from an exceptional dish.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Red Wine:</span> Cook the <span class="italic">stracotto</span> in a Barolo, Barbaresco, or a big Zinfandel.</p>

<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">A Little History</span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">It is intriguing to think that this luxurious pasta may have been born of crusts of bread discarded after Medieval banquets. Once the trenchers, or “plates,” of crisp bread were soaked with meat juices, they were thrown away, to be gathered by peasants who waited eagerly for any leftovers. Imagine an economical housewife stretching the discarded trenchers by using them to fill pastas, making a one-dish meal for her family. It is a logical explanation, if a little too tidy.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">According to Guglielmo Capacchi, authority on all things Parmesan, the first mention of anolini was in 1570. That year Bartolomeo Scappi, Bolognese cook to Pope Pius V, published a recipe, “To make Tortelletti with Pork Belly or Other Material that in (Common or) Vulgar Language are Called Annolini.” The dish contained spices, raisins, and meats and had a sauce of cheese, sugar, and cinnamon.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">By the early 19th century anolini had lost their sweet ingredients and were firmly ensconced in Parma’s culinary repertoire as a first course. Every family had special cutters for the round or half-moon-shaped pastas. Smooth discs are typical of Parma province. Along the Po River in neighboring Piacenza, crenelated cutters are used, actual meats (not only cooking juices) are added to the filling, and anolini become <span class="italic">marubei</span>. To the south of Parma in Reggio, anolini remain round, are called <span class="italic">cappelletti</span>, and have chicken giblets added to Piacenza’s recipe. In Parma, almost everyone agrees that anolini are made with beef—although some old-timers insist that donkey, which was popular for many years, gives even better flavor. There are two different forms of the pasta, depending upon who is the cook. Half moons are less wasteful and appear often, but coin-size discs are more traditional. Anolini’s coin shape actually comes from a coin, the Marie Louise silver piece of over 150 years ago. The 1½-inch size fits nicely into a large soup spoon and is easily cut out with a liqueur or shot glass.</p>

<div class="bibliography">
<p class="bibliographyEntry" style="text-indent: -5%;"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Method</span>   Working Ahead:</span> <span class="italic">The filling can be made the day before you fill the pasta. You can fill and shape the tortelli up to 12 hours before serving, though they are best eaten within about 4 hours. Store them in the refrigerator on towel-lined baskets or baking sheets, making sure the pieces do not touch; cover with another towel, and turn every 2 hours to ensure even drying. These do not freeze well</span>.</p>
</div>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Filling:</span> Bring the 1½ cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan. While it is heating, trim away the Swiss chard’s stalks (reserve them for another use). Wash the leaves under cold running water. Drop them into the boiling water and cook, covered, until wilted, about 5 minutes. Drain in a sieve, let cool briefly, and then squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Chop the leaves very fine.</p>
<a id="page154"/>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">In a medium-size bowl, blend the chard with the ricotta, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and a generous pinch of nutmeg. Add salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the eggs until thoroughly blended. Turn the mixture into a stainless steel or glass container, cover, and chill until ready to use.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Shaping the Tortelli:</span> Have handy several large flat baskets or baking sheets covered with kitchen towels. Stretch and thin the pasta as directed in Pastas, working a quarter of the dough at a time. You should be able to see color and form through the dough. Cut it into sheets 5½ inches wide, covering them with plastic wrap to keep them from drying out.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Make a row of small spoonfuls of filling along each of the two long edges of a pasta strip. Place the filling about 1 inch in from the edge, and space the spoonfuls about 1½ inches apart. Fold the two long edges over, toward the strip’s center, so they cover the filling. Seal the dough around the filling, eliminating air pockets as you work. Then, using a pasta wheel, cut rectangular tortelli, about 1½ by 2 inches, around each mound of filling. Arrange in single layers, without touching, on the baskets.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Cooking and Serving the Tortelli:</span> Warm a serving bowl and shallow soup dishes in a low oven. Melt the butter in a small pan and keep warm. Bring the pasta water to a fierce boil (in two pots if necessary). Slip the tortelli into the boiling water and cook 4 to 10 minutes, depending upon how dry they are. If very fresh, they’ll cook in even less time. Taste for doneness, testing sooner rather than later. The edges should be tender but still have some resistance or “bite.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Lift about half the tortelli from the boiling water with a large skimmer, letting the water drain back into the pot. Spread the pastas in a layer in the heated serving bowl. Quickly spoon some of the butter and a generous sprinkling of Parmigiano-Reggiano over the tortelli. Skim out the rest of the pastas, moisten them with butter, and sprinkle with cheese. Serve at once. Pass the rest of the Parmigiano-Reggiano.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Menu:</span> A light menu with the tortelli as its main dish could begin with Spring Salad with Hazelnuts and end with Frozen Chocolate Pistachio Cream with Hot Chocolate Marsala Sauce.

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Roasting the Chestnuts:</span> While the raisins are soaking, prepare the chestnuts. Cut a slit two thirds of the way around each nut with a small sharp knife. To cook the chestnuts over an open fire (which gives them a fine smokey flavor and was the method used in Italy until about 40 years ago), use a long-handled perforated skillet or chestnut roaster. Set the pan on a rack about 6 inches above the hot coals. Roast 30 to 45 minutes, or until the chestnuts’ interior is mealy and tender. Shake and stir the nuts often.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">To cook the chestnuts in the oven, preheat to 400°F. Spread the chestnuts in a large shallow baking pan, and roast them 1 hour, or until the interior of the chestnuts is mealy and tender. Cool the roasted chestnuts about 15 minutes. Then pull away their shells and inner skin. (Pull away all the inner skin, as it can be bitter.) Pass through the coarsest blade of a food mill, or finely chop them in a food processor (do not purée). Transfer them to a medium-size bowl.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Filling:</span> Peel and core both the apple and the pear. Cut the fruit into ¼- to ½-inch dice. Heat the 1½ tablespoons butter in a medium skillet over high heat, taking care that it does not burn. Add the pear, apple, and lemon zest. Cook quickly, scooping the fruits up with a wooden spatula and turning them so they brown evenly. This takes 3 to 5 minutes. Watch carefully; their sugar content encourages burning.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Once the pieces are a rich golden brown, add the cinnamon and pepper and cook for a few seconds or until you can smell the cinnamon. Add the raisins and their liquid, and continue cooking over high heat, about 3 minutes, while scraping up the brown glaze in the bottom of the skillet. Add 6 tablespoons of the grape syrup, and boil for a few seconds until thick. Remove from the heat and allow to cool. Using a spatula, fold the sautéed fruit, the remaining 2 tablespoons grape syrup, and the ¼ cup water into the chestnuts. Blend well.</p>

The filled pastas can be refrigerated, covered with a cloth, up to 12 hours before cooking and serving; turn three or four times to keep them from becoming gummy</span>.</p>
</div>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Filling:</span> In a 12-inch sauté pan, heat the olive oil and pancetta over medium-high heat. Cook 3 minutes, or until the pancetta begins to melt and looks transparent. Turn the heat to high. Add the cabbage and sauté, stirring frequently, 5 minutes or until it begins to brown. Add the onion and continue stirring frequently over high heat another 5 minutes or until the onion and cabbage are deep golden brown. Lower the heat if the brown glaze at the bottom of the pan threatens to burn. That glaze is the key to the filling’s big flavors. Stir in the garlic, and cook just a few seconds.</p>
<a id="page161"/>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Turn the cabbage and onion into a bowl. Put the sauté pan back over high heat, and immediately add the ½ cup stock or water. Boil it down as you scrape up the brown glaze with a wooden spatula. When nearly all the liquid has evaporated, add it to the cabbage mixture. If the potatoes are still hot, cool them about 20 minutes. Then split them and spoon the pulp into the bowl with the cabbage. Toss the cabbage mixture with the <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> to ½ cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, salt and pepper, and nutmeg. Avoid mashing the potatoes. Instead crush them, keeping the mixture chunky. There should be more than a suggestion of nutmeg and pepper.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Preparing the Tortelli:</span> Follow the directions in Pastas. Fill the pasta as for Tortelli of Ricotta and Fresh Greens, being a little more generous with the stuffing, resulting in tortelli about 2½ by 2½ inches. Spread them on flat cloth-lined baskets, making sure the pieces do not touch.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Cooking the Tortelli and Sauce:</span> Have a serving bowl and shallow soup dishes warming in a low oven. Bring the salted water to a fierce boil. While the water is heating, take about 5 minutes to boil down the stock to about 1¼ cups. Stir in the butter, and heat until creamy but not totally melted. Keep warm.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Drop the tortelli into the boiling water and boil 3 to 10 minutes, depending upon how dry they are. Taste for doneness; the edges should be tender but still have some resistance or “bite.” Quickly lift half the pastas from the water with a large skimmer. Drain them for a few seconds over the pot, and slip them into the heated serving bowl. Spoon some of the sauce and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese over them. Lift out the remaining tortelli, and top with the remaining sauce and cheese.</p>

Piacenza’s Tortelli with Tails</a></span></span></p>

<p class="chapterByline" style="text-indent: 5%;">L<span class="italic">ooking like long sticks of hard candy in cellophane wrapping, with twisted tails at either end, these pastas are made even more unusual by the evenly tucked and pleated closure down their length. Called <span class="underline">turtei</span> in Piacenza dialect, their simple filling of cheese and greens is light and fragrant. Although time-consuming to make, they can be shaped well ahead of time and need only to be tossed with butter and cheese before serving</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">My favorite Piacenza cook happens also to be my step-aunt, Delphina Fulvini Ozera. Her turtei are legendary—sweet with the freshest ricotta and young chard, and so light they levitate off the plate. Sitting in Delphina’s kitchen, watching her rhythmically fold, pleat, and twist piece after piece, is both mesmerizing and intimidating. Would that I could equal her skill. Some comfort comes from knowing that Delphina was making turtei before I was ever dreamt of. In her girlhood no Piacenza woman was considered properly brought up unless she could make perfect turtei</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Although you may lack a Piacenza childhood, a little practice and patience produce reasonable facsimiles of Delphina’s elegant pastas. Count on the first ten or so being “for the family,” as is said in Italy. After that they will start to look quite good. Serve to friends who truly love pasta, and who will applaud your accomplishment</span>.</p>

<div class="bibliography">
<p class="bibliographyEntry" style="text-indent: -5%;"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Method</span>   Working Ahead:</span> <span class="italic">The filling will hold, covered, in the refrigerator 24 hours before stuffing the tortelli. The pastas can then be filled 24 hours ahead and stored, covered with a kitchen towel, in the refrigerator. Turn them three or four times. They do not freeze well</span>.</p>
</div>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Filling:</span> Trim away the Swiss chard’s white stalks and reserve them for another use. (If you are using spinach, trim away the tough stems.) Wash the leaves well, and without shaking off the water clinging to them, tuck the leaves into a 4-quart saucepan. Add the <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup water, cover, and cook over medium heat until wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain and allow to cool. Squeeze the leaves as dry as possible, finely chop, and transfer to a medium-size bowl.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Push the ricotta through a strainer, or purée it in a food processor. Stir it into the chard or spinach. Blend in the ¾ cup Parmigiano-Reggiano, salt and pepper, and nutmeg. Taste for balance; the nutmeg should be only a whisper of flavor. Then beat in the egg. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Filling the Pasta:</span> Stretch and thin the pasta until you can see color through it, as described in Pastas. Work with only a quarter of the dough at a time, thinning and filling before going on to the next portion.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Now the fun begins. Settle back and enjoy making these tortelli. Don’t try to rush the experience. Sharing the adventure with like-minded friends makes shorter work of it. Have handy several large flat baskets covered with kitchen towels.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Cut the pasta into long strips about 4½ inches wide. Cut each strip in half lengthwise. Keep the strips of pasta covered with plastic wrap until you are ready to work with them. Create diamond shapes by cutting each of the strips on the diagonal, spacing the cuts every 2¼ inches, so that each diamond’s sides measure about 2¼ inches. Keep the cut pieces covered while you work with one or two. Put a narrow row (about 1 teaspoon) of filling in the center of a diamond.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Place the pasta with the long strip of filling perpendicular to you. Fold the two points of the diamond on the left and right of the row of filling over each other, covering the filling. Pinch together the two overlapping pieces of pasta, using your thumb and forefinger to make a row of pinched closures down the length of the pasta. As you pinch together the pasta, twist it slightly to create an undulating ridge. This pleating will form a rippling scalloped appearance.</p>
<a id="page164"/>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Twist and seal the ends, creating the “tails.” Place them in a single layer, without touching, on the towel-lined baskets. Uncover more of the cut pasta and repeat the process. Once the first batch is done, stretch and thin the next portion of the dough, and continue.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Cooking and Serving the Turtei:</span> Have a serving bowl and soup dishes warming in a low oven. Have a large colander ready for draining the tortelli. Bring the salted water to a strong boil. Drop in the pastas and cook until their tails are pleasingly firm to the bite yet tender enough to eat. If freshly made, they will take about 3 to 4 minutes. If they have been done up to 24 hours ahead, they may need 8 or 10 minutes. While the pasta cooks, melt the butter in a small saucepan.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Gently pour the cooked tortelli into the colander, taking care not to break them. Carefully pour about one third of the pastas into the heated serving bowl. Spoon a third of the butter over them, and then a generous sprinkling of the cheese. Top with another third, and more butter and cheese. Finally pour in the last portion, top it with the remaining butter and some more cheese, and serve immediately. Pass any leftover cheese separately.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Although strongly identified with Bologna, this lasagne is found throughout the region. Its ragù sauce may change slightly from one area to another, but the dish is always a vivid expression of the “less is more” philosophy of cooking. Mere films of béchamel sauce and meat ragù coat the sheerest spinach pasta. Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese dusts each layer. There is nothing more; no ricotta, no piling on of meats, vegetables, or cheeses; little tomato, and no hot spice. Baking performs the final marriage of flavors. The results are splendid</span>.</p>

The ragù also freezes well up to 1 month. The pasta can be rolled out, cut, and dried up to 24 hours before cooking. The assembled lasagne can wait at room temperature about 1 hour before baking. Do not refrigerate it before baking, as the topping of béchamel and cheese will overcook by the time the center is hot</span>.</p>
</div>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Béchamel:</span> Melt the butter in a 3- to 4-quart saucepan over medium-low heat. Sprinkle with the flour and whisk until smooth. Stir without stopping about 3 minutes. Then whisk in the milk a little at a time, keeping the mixture smooth. Bring to a slow bubble, and stir 3 to 4 minutes, or until the sauce <a id="page166"/>thickens. Cook, stirring, 5 minutes, or until all raw flour taste has disappeared. Season with salt, pepper, and a hint of nutmeg.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Assembling the Ingredients:</span> Have the pasta, ragù sauce, béchamel, and cheese at hand. Have a large perforated skimmer and a large bowl of cold water next to the stove. Spread a double thickness of paper towels over a large counter space. Rewarm the sauces gently over medium heat. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Oil or butter a 3-quart shallow baking dish.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Cooking the Pasta:</span> Bring the salted water to boil. Drop about four pieces of pasta in the water at a time. Cook about 2 minutes. If you are using dried pasta, cook about 4 minutes, taste, and cook longer if necessary. The pasta will continue cooking during baking, so make sure it is only barely tender. Lift the lasagne from the water with a skimmer, drain, and then slip into the bowl of cold water to stop cooking. When cool, lift out and dry on the paper towels. Repeat until all the pasta is cooked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Assembling the Lasagne:</span> Spread a thin film of béchamel over the bottom of the baking dish. Arrange a layer of about four overlapping sheets of pasta over the béchamel. Spread a thin film of béchamel (about 3 or 4 spoonfuls) over the pasta, and then an equally thin film of the Ragù. Sprinkle with about 1½ tablespoons of the cheese. Top with another layer and repeat the process. Reserve about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup of the béchamel and about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup of the cheese for the top of the lasagne. Spread the sauce to completely cover the last layer of pasta. Then top with a generous dusting of cheese.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Baking and Serving the Lasagne:</span> Cover the baking dish lightly with foil, taking care not to let it touch the top of the lasagne. Bake 40 minutes, or until almost heated through. Remove the foil and bake another 10 minutes, or until hot in the center. Test by inserting a knife in the center. If it comes out very warm, the dish is ready. Take care not to brown the cheese topping. It should be melted, creamy-looking, and barely tinged with a little gold. Let the lasagne rest in the turned-off oven with the door ajar about 10 minutes. Then serve. This is not a solid lasagne, but a moist one that slips a bit when it is cut and placed on a dinner plate.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Preparing the Porcini:</span> Rinse the dried mushroom pieces under cold running water to rid them of sand and particles. If mushroom pieces are small, rid them of sand by swishing them in a bowl of cold water. Pause for a moment, allowing the sand and particles to settle to the bottom of the bowl, then quickly scoop out the mushrooms with your hands. Repeat if necessary. Then place them in a medium-size bowl and cover with the hot water. Let stand 30 minutes, or until softened. Lift the <a id="page172"/>mushrooms from the soaking liquid, squeeze out excess moisture, and coarsely chop. Line a small sieve with a paper towel for straining the liquid into the mushroom sauce.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Sauce:</span> Heat the oil in a large skillet. Add the onion, prosciutto, and parsley. Sauté over medium heat, stirring frequently, 5 minutes, or until the onion is barely tinged with gold. Add the fresh mushrooms and cook over high heat 10 minutes, or until they are golden brown. Stir in the chopped porcini, reduce the heat to medium-high, and cook 2 minutes. Cook in the garlic and herbs 1 minute.</p>

Once the wine has cooked down to a sheer film, add the tomatoes. Cook, uncovered, over medium-high heat 10 minutes, or until the sauce is richly flavored. If it is at all watery or lacking body, keep it bubbling over medium-high heat until reduced and intensified.</p>

Have a large bowl of cold water handy. Bring the salted water to a vigorous boil. Drop three or four sheets of lasagne into the boiling water, and cook until tender but still pleasingly firm to the bite. This will take about 2 minutes for fresh pasta, 4 or more for dried. Remove the sheets with a large skimmer or flat slotted spoon, and drop them in the cold water to stop the cooking. Then lift the sheets from the water and drain on the paper towels. Repeat with all the lasagne sheets. Lightly oil or butter a shallow 2½- to 3-quart baking dish. Have the sauce, cheese, pasta, and cream mixture close at hand. Film the bottom of the baking dish with a little of the sauce. Cover the sauce with overlapping sheets of pasta. Spread about ¼ to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup of the sauce over the pasta, just enough to moisten the sheets. Sprinkle the sauce with 2 to 3 tablespoons Parmigiano-Reggiano. Repeat the layering, saucing, and sprinkling with cheese until you reach the top of the dish. All the mushroom sauce should be used up, and about 8 tablespoons of cheese will be left over. Blend the remaining cheese with the cream mixture, and spread it over the last layer of pasta. Lightly cover the lasagne with foil.</p>

Drop in the tortellini and cook 3 to 8 minutes, or until tender but firm enough to have resilience or “bite.” Drain well and turn into a large bowl.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Assembling:</span> Gently warm the ragù. Wrap the meatballs in foil and warm them 10 minutes in a 350°F oven. Remove the meatballs and turn the heat to 400°F. Add two thirds of the ragù (save the rest for another use) to the tortellini, along with half the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and about two thirds of the beaten egg. Gently fold together until well blended.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Take the springform pan and cookie sheet out of the refrigerator. Spoon half the meatballs over the bottom of the crust, and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of cheese. Spread half the tortellini over the meatballs pressing them down gently with the back of a large spoon. Top with the remaining meatballs and another spoonful of cheese. Add the remaining tortellini, gently pressing them into the filling with the back of the large spoon. Dust with the rest of the Parmigiano-Reggiano. Spread the cinnamon custard over all. Brush the overhanging crust with beaten egg. Seal the reserved pastry round to the rim of the pie by pinching the two pieces together. Form a thick upstanding rim by rolling the edge in toward the center of the pie. Crimp or flute all around the crust. Brush the entire surface with more beaten egg.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Decorating the Crust:</span> Roll out the leftover dough. Cut 4-inch-long ovals of dough to resemble long California bay leaves. Cut a 1-inch-diameter steam hole in the center of the crust, and arrange the leaves in a sunburst pattern around it, overlapping them slightly toward the center. Small leaves could be arranged in clusters around the pie’s rim. Brush all the decorations with beaten egg, and set the pie on a baking sheet.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Baking:</span> Place the baking sheet in the lower third of the oven, and bake 40 minutes. Lower the heat to 350°F and bake another 40 minutes. Let the pie stand in the turned-off oven with the door open halfway 10 to 20 minutes before serving.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">The Presentation:</span> Unmold by setting the springform pan on three large cans. Release the springform and let it drop down to the counter. Place the pie on a large silver tray or china platter garnished with clusters of lemon leaves, spruce sprigs, grapes, or bouquets of fresh bay leaves. Cut the pie at the table.</p>

An aged red Recioto della Valpolicella Amarone from the Veneto is ideal with the pie.</p>
</div>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Menu:</span> Although traditionally a first course at festive meals, the pie is a spectacular main dish for buffets and special dinners. In keeping with the pie’s lineage, start with Almond Spice Broth. Afterward pass platters of fresh fennel and chunks of Parmigiano-Reggiano to eat with the last of the red wine. Dessert could be Strawberries in Red Wine or Meringues of the Dark Lake.</p>

<p class="boxTitle" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold">A Little Renaissance Dinner</span></p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">It was a cold afternoon in January, 1529. The turreted Este Castle in Ferrara’s main square appeared and disappeared in billows of fog. Outside all was gray and icy. Inside, one of Ferrara’s state banquets was about to begin. On the surface it was Don Ercole d’Este honoring his father, Alfonso, the Duke of Ferrara. But the banquet was really about the power of the Este family, about displaying Ferrara’s wealth to the important guests—ambassadors of the Venetian Senate and the Archbishop of Milan among them. One hundred and four sat down to a dinner that expressed every bit of the magnificence the Este court was famous for. Leonardo da Vinci had stated that Ferrara possessed “the most brilliant and enlightened court in Europe.”</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Over 120 dishes were served in ten courses. Specially composed music marked each service. Ariosto, the poet and playwright of the day, presented a new comedy. The main table was decorated with tall-sided pies, whose fancy crusts were gilded in golden egg yolk. Few dishes surviving today so vividly express the grandeur and glamour of those times. Records of Italian court life during the Medieval and Renaissance eras tell of many types of elaborate and savory pies. The legacy of pastry, sugar, and spice from the Arab world gave birth to these fantastical creations. Sugar was a status symbol. It was used with abandon. Sweet crusts enclosing savory/sweet fillings were the fashion of the day. Many were designed to be show-stoppers: when their lids were lifted, flocks of live birds flew out. Some fillings contained 3 pounds each of butter and salt pork, four roast pigeons, juice of sour grapes, saffron, nutmeg, cloves, and handfuls of cinnamon and pepper. Others still sound feasible to modern palates, like the simplicity of veal sautéed with lemon and pistachios.</p>
<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Savory pies still mark important occasions in Emilia-Romagna. Sweet crusts have survived, but the fillings generally center on pasta; stuffed ones in Bologna and Romagna; hollow maccheroni in the rest of the region. The recipe for this Unusual Tortellini Pie is adapted from one handed down through a Bolognese family. The pie illustrates the evolution of these dishes from the Renaissance to today. The custard’s sweetness and spice keeps that Arab legacy intact, while the meat ragù reflects the 18th and 19th centuries, with its wine, broth, and tomato instead of sour grape juice and spices. The cream in the ragù sauce marks the 20th century by replacing the traditional béchamel.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">The pie was created in 1700, when a papal legation arrived in Ferrara with much pomp and feasting. Its dome shape, inspired by the priests’ hats, was a tribute to the churchmen. It is still the traditional first course of Ferrara’s weddings and holiday dinners, and <span class="underline">Pasticcio di Maccheroni</span> always marks Fat Tuesday and the last Sunday of Carnival before Lent. Some cooks use fresh local white truffles instead of the wild mushrooms. This particular recipe is a melding of two family versions shared by Ferrarese linguist Riccardo Rimondi</span>.</p>

<div class="bibliography">
<p class="bibliographyEntry" style="text-indent: -5%;"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Method</span></span> <span class="bold">Working Ahead:</span> <span class="italic">Prepare each part of the dish well ahead, and then assemble it shortly before baking. The mushrooms, béchamel, and ragù will hold, covered, in the refrigerator up to 3 days. (The ragù can be frozen up to 1 month.) The pastry dough can be made 3 days ahead; wrap and refrigerate</span>.</p>
</div>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Preparing the Mushrooms:</span> Porcini can be sandy, so first swish them in a bowl of cold water. Pause for a moment, allowing the particles to settle to the bottom of the bowl, then quickly scoop out the mushrooms with your hands. Repeat two times. Put the mushrooms in another bowl and cover with the hot water. Soak 30 minutes, or until softened. Lift out the mushrooms, squeezing them to release as much liquid as possible. Reserve the soaking water. Coarsely chop. Heat the 1 tablespoon butter in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and small onion, and sauté 3 minutes. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Cool, cover, and refrigerate. Strain the soaking liquid through a paper-towel-lined sieve, measuring out the <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup needed for the ragù.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Béchamel:</span> This old-style recipe produces an especially aromatic version of béchamel. Combine the milk with the onion, white peppercorns, cloves, and bay leaves in a 4-quart pot. Simmer, uncovered, 10 minutes, and remove from the heat. In another 3- to 4-quart pot, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Stir in the flour and cook about 5 minutes, stirring, adjusting the heat so the flour does not color. Strain the milk into the flour mixture and raise the heat to medium. Whisk continuously, 3 to 4 minutes, or until the sauce comes to a gentle bubble. Keep whisking as the sauce bubbles, 5 to 8 minutes. The béchamel is ready when any raw flour taste has disappeared and the sauce is thick enough to generously coat a spoon. Season with salt, white pepper, and nutmeg. If you are not using the béchamel soon, allow it to cool, cover the surface with a sheet of plastic wrap, and refrigerate.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Dough by Hand:</span> Stir the dry ingredients together in a large bowl. Using only your fingertips, rub in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal with occasional shales of flour-coated butter. Hollow out a well in the flour, and add the eggs and yolks. Beat the eggs with a fork to blend them. Then gradually toss them with the flour/butter mixture until the dough is moistened. Do not stir or beat, and don’t worry if the dough looks rough. Gather it into a ball, wrap, and chill at least 30 minutes.</p>
<a id="page182"/>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Making the Dough in a Food Processor:</span> Combine the dry ingredients in the processor, add the butter, and process with the on/off pulse until the mixture looks like coarse meal. Add the eggs and yolks, and blend with the on/off pulse until the mixture starts to gather in clumps. Turn it out onto a sheet of plastic wrap, gather into a ball, wrap, and chill at least 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Assembling the Pie:</span> Preheat the oven to 425°F. Allow the mushrooms, ragù and béchamel to come to room temperature if they were chilled. Grease the bottom and sides of a 10-inch springform pan with the tablespoon of butter. Roll out one third of the pastry to form a round about ¼ to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch thick. Trim it to a 13-inch circle. Fit it into the bottom of the pan, forming a 1½-inch border up the sides (the dough is fragile, so do not hesitate to press it into the pan if it breaks). Chill about 30 minutes. Line the chilled pastry with foil, weight it with dried beans or rice, and bake 10 minutes. Remove the liner and weights, prick the crust with a fork, and bake 5 more minutes. Allow it to cool. Leave the oven on.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Bring the salted water to a fierce boil. Drop in the pasta and cook, stirring frequently, about 2 minutes, or until barely tender (it still has to bake inside the pie). Drain thoroughly in a colander, and turn into a large bowl. Blend the béchamel and half the cheese into the pasta. Fold in the mushrooms, but do not blend them in totally. Spread half the pasta mixture over the bottom crust (still in the springform pan). Top it with half the ragù, and sprinkle with half the remaining cheese. Top the ragù with half the remaining pasta, forming a domed mound. Spread the rest of the ragù and cheese over the pasta. Then top everything with the pasta that is left. Use the back of a large spoon to gently compress the layers into a tall dome shape.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Roll out the remaining pastry to form a large round. Set the springform pan on several large cans. Release and slip off the sides. Then transfer the <span class="italic">pasticcio</span>, still on the springform bottom, to a baking sheet. Brush the outside of the pastry base with beaten egg. Lay the rolled-out pastry over the mound, sealing it to the egg-covered base. Trim the top pastry so there is a 1-inch border around the pie. Roll it up to form a crimped rim around the base of the dome. This decorative rim should almost entirely cover any sign of the springform pan base.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Brush the crust with beaten egg. Using a fluted biscuit cutter, cut out several different-size rounds from leftover dough, and arrange them in a geometric pattern over the top of the pie (if the dough broke while it was being laid over the pie, pinch the breaks together and cover them with decoration). Make four slits near the top of the pie, and brush it again with egg. Slip the baking sheet <span class="italic">onto</span> the middle rack of the oven.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Bake 20 minutes at 425°F. Lower the heat to 375°F and bake 35 to 40 minutes more, or until the pastry is deep golden brown. Turn the oven off, leave the door ajar, and let the pie rest in the oven 10 minutes (not much longer, as it will dry out). Set <a id="page183"/>it on a large round platter, and garnish with clusters of fresh lemon leaves, bay leaves, laurel leaves, or ivy. Serve hot.</p>
