			<p class="rec-intro">This is a recipe that dates back to the mid 1700s and it was probably named Bath pudding because it was cooked in a bath of water rather than after the town. Lovely served with some warm fruit compote.</p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 6–8</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">60g round pudding rice </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">450ml milk</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 pinch of salt</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">50ml double cream</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">thinly pared peel of ½ lemon</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">unsalted butter, for greasing</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 free-range eggs</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 free-range egg yolk</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">60g sugar</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">finely grated zest of ½ lemon </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">raspberry jam, melted</p>

		<div class="basic-text-frame">
			<p class="body">Grind the rice in a food processor until it is the texture of fine semolina. Mix a little of the milk with the ground rice and a pinch of salt to make a paste. </p>
			<p class="body">Bring the rest of the milk and cream to the boil, with the thinly pared lemon peel. Pour this on to the rice paste and stir well, then tip it all back into the pan and bring to the boil. Leave to cool for about 10 minutes, then remove the peel. </p>
			<p class="body">Butter a 750ml jelly mould or pudding basin. Whisk the whole eggs, yolk, sugar and grated lemon zest in a large bowl, then stir in the rice mixture and mix well. Pour the mixture into the buttered mould or basin and cover with foil. Place the bowl in a saucepan and add hot water to come about halfway up the sides. Bring the water to the boil, then simmer gently for 1½ hours or until the pudding is set. Leave to cool for a few moments before turning out. </p>
			<p class="body">Brush with some melted jam and serve with a warm fruit compote.</p>
