<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">The Great River Road</a>
</h1>
<p class="pf">One summer not many years ago Dick and I decided to take a trip along the Mississippi River, down one side and up the other, to explore the region. My interest was mainly the food, and Dick’s the geology—and between the two there was lots to enjoy. The Great River Road was established in 1938 and follows the course of the Mississippi River from northern Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico. It is nearly three thousand miles long and touches on ten states, numerous parks, and historic sites. Driving the Great River Road is one of the most fascinating vacations one can have, but you do have to take the time to enjoy the local events as you meander through the countryside.</p>
<p>There’s a seaside atmosphere running right down the center of this great country. River villages, such as Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and Port Gibson, Mississippi, perch spectacularly along the river and there are huge floating hotels like the Mississippi Queen that create a festive scene as they chug into small-town ports. The scenery varies from rolling hills to rocky cliffs, as well as lofty arched trees—perfect places for picnics.</p>
<p>One observation was how the Civil War seemingly came to life as we crossed the state borders going south. In Galena, Illinois, we checked into the restored mansion given to General Ulysses Grant and his family following the Civil War. A tour of the house hinted at the theme we followed during the trip—the living history of the Civil War.</p>
<p>From Galena southward, catfish—the most popular of the “fresh fish”—was prominent on menus. It was usually deep fried with a golden crust. I remember, as a kid, throwing the ugly catfish back into the St. Louis River in favor of northern pike and walleye.</p>
<p>We bumped along in our Honda Civic to the next town of Nauvoo, Illinois, which was founded by the Latter-day Saints in 1839. Its temple stands high on a bluff overlooking a bend in the Mississippi River and is a reproduction of the original nineteenth-century temple that was damaged by fire in the mid-1800s. Curiously, Nauvoo is famous for three things: wheat bread and pastries, blue cheese, and wine. Here we enjoyed a delicious wheat-and-nut coffeecake, and I begged the bakery for the recipe—which they conveniently pointed to in a recipe book on their shelves. I reworked the recipe, as chef’s recipes rarely turn out at home exactly as they’re made at a restaurant. Here is my version of a classic Nauvoo wheat-and-nut coffeecake.</p>
<p class="psec">Farther on down the River Road in New Orleans we happened upon a cooking school just in time to enroll for a demonstration on preparing okra gumbo, shrimp creole, Caesar salad, bananas Foster, and café brûlot.</p>
<p>Our instructor was a native Creole and explained Creole as being a blend of French, Spanish, American Indian, and African cookery. From the French came basic knowledge of fine cookery, and because the French settlers had to adapt recipes to use local ingredients, many of the techniques involved are somewhat classic French. From the Spanish came a gusto for piquancy and the use of various peppers from mild to hot. Africans contributed “slow cooking” methods, according to our teacher, because the native cooking vessel was a huge clay bowl. From local Indians came the gift of herbs and spices.</p>
<p>As he chopped and mixed and stirred, the instructor explained that long, slow cooking produces mellow and delicious flavors. Quoting his mother, he drawled in his Southern accent, “You dooze it until it beeze right.”</p>
<p>I collected the recipe for shrimp creole from him, and back in Minnesota I revised the recipe, and further, I serve it with wild rice. I figured if everyone can make changes in the original, I can too!</p>
