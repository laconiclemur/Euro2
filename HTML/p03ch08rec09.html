<p class="summary"><span class="bi">Gaspar Rey I Grifé is the founder, editor, and main writer of</span> <span class="italic">Cocina Futuro,</span> a magazine for and about chefs, caterers, and restaurateurs. He travels around the country to wherever something of interest is happening and keeps up with all that the chefs are doing in Spain. Gaspar is a cultured and worldly Catalan who left Spain because he found it oppressive under Franco. The Madrid he fled in the 1960s was like a small provincial city. The oil was rancid, the wine rough and acidic, and people did not care. And chefs were never seen out of the kitchen. Since Gaspar came back to live in Madrid in 1994, he has been getting a lot of joy from witnessing—and from being in a position to encourage—the transformation of Spanish products and gastronomy.</p>
<p class="summary">A friend gave me Gaspar’s telephone number when I decided suddenly to go to Asturias, and he in turn gave me contacts there and in other regions. He took me to some of the best restaurants in Madrid and Toledo and gave me his insider’s views on wine, on small farms that are rediscovering old products (like black tomatoes), on new products (like foie gras and seaweed), on food fashions, and on the ways and techniques of <span class="italic">nueva cocina</span> chefs. We discussed all kinds of dishes and, in particular, ways of cooking fish.</p>
