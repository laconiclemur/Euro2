 STRAWBERRY &amp; MINT BAKED CHEESECAKE</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_blue" id="nad0001688">
<em>I’m sure we’ve all sat at a dinner table and discussed which is better: baked cheesecake or the non-baked kind. No? Well, I have had that discussion even if you haven’t, and the realization that all my diners unanimously preferred a baked cheesecake came just as I was a breath away from presenting the ‘other’ kind! I’m happy to say the cheesecake was consumed all the same, of course, but the incident made me sit up in bed scouring books for recipes. Not an unfamiliar scene in my bed. Since then, I’ve come to absolutely love the gentle nature of baking a cheesecake. It’s slow but the results are velvety smooth and worth the wait. This baked cheesecake is topped with a deliciously fragrant strawberry and mint compote.</em>

<span class="blue">
<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Grease the base of a 23cm loose-bottomed cake tin, making sure to secure the base (trust me, you don’t want to go there!). Make sure to grease the sides well too. Line the base of the tin with baking paper.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001708">
<span class="blue">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001709">
<span class="blue">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Put the crushed biscuits and melted butter into a bowl and mix until the mixture resembles wet sand and there are no dry clumps remaining.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001710">
<span class="blue">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Put the mixture into the cake tin and use the palms of your hands to push it down until it is all compact and tight in the base.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001711">
<span class="blue">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 Bake on the middle shelf for 10 minutes, then remove and set aside to cool. Reduce the oven to 160°C/140°C fan/gas 3.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001712">
<span class="blue">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Put the cream cheese, caster sugar and double cream into a large bowl. Mix to soften the mixture so it’s all viscous.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001713">
<span class="blue">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Now add the flour, eggs, egg yolk and vanilla paste and mix again, to get a smooth, even batter.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001714">
<span class="blue">
<strong>8.</strong>
</span>
 Put the kettle on to boil. Wrap the outside of the cake tin with two layers of foil to make sure it’s completely watertight, then place the tin in a large roasting dish and fill the dish with boiling water to come halfway up the outside of the cake tin.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001715">
<span class="blue">
<strong>9.</strong>
</span>
 Pour in the cheesecake mixture on top of the biscuit base, then cover the roasting tin with a large tent of foil, securing it around the edges of the tin – this will keep the steam in as the cheesecake bakes.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001716">
<span class="blue">
<strong>10.</strong>
</span>
 Bake the cheesecake for 1 hour. You will know it is ready when it’s golden and firm around the edge but still has a slight wobble in the centre. If it’s still very wobbly, bake for another 10–15 minutes, checking it often.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001717">
<span class="blue">
<strong>11.</strong>
</span>
 Once the cheesecake is baked, turn off the oven, open the oven door wide and leave the cheesecake in there for 2 hours. It will become firmer as it cools.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001718">
<span class="blue">
<strong>12.</strong>
</span>
 After 2 hours, take<a id="pg229"></a>
 the cheesecake out of the oven and out of the roasting tin and put it into the fridge overnight.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001719">
<span class="blue">
<strong>13.</strong>
</span>
 To prepare the compote, put the strawberries into a pan with the sugar and lemon juice. Cook for about 10–12 minutes on a medium heat, until the sugar has melted and the sauce has reduced slightly. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and leave to cool completely, then stir in the fresh mint.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0001720">
<span class="blue">
<strong>14.</strong>
</span>
 Take the cheesecake out of the fridge, transfer to a serving plate or stand, and top with the strawberry and mint compote.</p>
