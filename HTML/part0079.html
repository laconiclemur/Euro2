<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0003387">The colours and flavours of this dish are stunning. But it doesn’t matter how long or how gently you cook it, English octopus is always tough. You need to use double-sucker octopus (<em class="calibre9">Octopus vulgaris</em>) from Spain or Morocco: this is readily available and is always frozen. The freezing process breaks down the membranes, which actually makes the octopus softer. If you can’t find octopus, you could use squid or cuttlefish instead.</p>
<p class="rec_intro" id="sab0003388">Octopus is very important in Galicia. The old, traditional Galician way to cook it is in a giant handmade copper pot, which is supposed to give the octopus more flavour. This doesn’t really happen any more, but it’s not uncommon to add a few copper coins to the pan in homage to the old method, or to add a wine cork, which is said to soften the octopus. There are lots of different stories and methods!</p>

<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0003404">To cook the octopus, fill a large pan with water, add the onion and bay leaf and put on a medium-high heat. When the water is steaming and close to boiling, take the octopus and (carefully) dip it into the water, then bring it up again – repeat three times. This makes the octopus relax, making the meat tender.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0003405">When the water starts to bubble again, lower the heat to low-medium and gently simmer the octopus according to its weight (20 minutes per kilo) – if the water is boiling too fast it will rip the octopus’s skin, so adjust the heat accordingly.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0003406">Take a toothpick and jab it into the thickest part. If it goes through cleanly, with no resistance, it is cooked, but if it feels like there’s something preventing you from pushing through, then it needs to cook for longer, otherwise it will be chewy. When you’re happy it is cooked, carefully remove the octopus from the pan to a tray and leave to cool. Cut it into 2cm pieces.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0003407">Blanch the prawns for 40 seconds to 1 minute in boiling water, then use a slotted spoon to remove them to a bowl of iced water to stop them continuing to cook.</p>
<p class="toc1ts" id="sab0003408">Mix together the vegetables, chillies, octopus, prawns and dill, add the olive oil, vinegar and salt and pepper to taste, and serve.</p>
