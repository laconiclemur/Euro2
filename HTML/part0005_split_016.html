			<p class="rec-intro">This recipe should be made with a fattened duck breast, which is large enough to feed two people. If you can’t find one of these, use two normal duck breasts instead. The Bordelaise garnish of bone marrow is an essential part of this rich dish, along  with the red wine and shallot sauce.</p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 2</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 fattened duck breast</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">4 large shallots, peeled and sliced</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">300ml red wine</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 tbsp caster sugar</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">bouquet garni, made up of a thyme, bay leaf and parsley (see<a href="part0010_split_038.html#Chef-s-notes" class="calibre4"> here</a>)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">500ml good veal stock</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 tbsp unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">100g beef bone marrow (removed from the bone)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">salt</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">black pepper</p>
			<p class="for-the">wild mushrooms </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">160g mixed wild mushrooms</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 tbsp unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 shallot, peeled and chopped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 garlic clove, peeled and chopped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1 bunch of flatleaf parsley, chopped</p>

			<p class="body">Trim the duck breast, then score the skin. Place the breast in a warm pan, skin-side down, season and cook gently to render the fat and crisp the skin. The breast will take about 12 minutes for pink meat, but only cook it on the flesh side for a couple of minutes. Leave it to rest before carving.</p>
			<p class="body">Put the sliced shallots in a pan with the wine and sugar. Bring to the boil, then add the herb bundle. Cook until the liquid has almost completely reduced, then add the stock and continue to reduce until it has the consistency of a sauce. Remove the herbs, then stir in the butter and seasoning to finish the sauce.</p>
			<p class="body">Simmer the bone marrow in salted water for 5–6 minutes, then drain. Place some bone marrow on the sliced duck and serve with the sauce and wild mushrooms. Lovely with some little potato cakes too – see the recipe for pommes Macaire on page 174.</p>
			<p class="alt-head">Wild mushrooms</p>
			<p class="body">Trim and wash the mushrooms as necessary. Heat a little vegetable oil in a pan and fry the mushrooms for 2 minutes. Drain, tipping away any water, then put the mushrooms back in the pan with the butter, chopped shallot and garlic. Season and finish with chopped parsley.</p>
