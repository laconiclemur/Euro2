<p class="chapterOpenerText" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">S</span></span><span class="italic">auces in Emilia-Romagna’s cooking fall into three categories. There are the sauces created for a specific pasta, like those found in the pasta chapter. There is the sauce yielded in the cooking of a dish, like the sauce that comes from the slow braising of a chicken in wine and tomato. A third type is the sauce made to enrich, or to be the sole garnish of, a dish—these sauces are included in this chapter. Of these, Meat Essences is the ultimate enrichment. It is very much a creation of the last century, when mere spoonfuls of this concentration of meat juices and wine added character to many dishes. I have revived this old sauce base because it works the same magic on modern recipes. It plays a role in many pastas and main dishes in this book, and it is indispensable in Nino Bergese’s extraordinary risotto</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Tomato sauces play several roles in Emilia-Romagna’s cuisine, but the most important is as a dressing for pasta. Winter Tomato Sauce is full and deep-flavored, meant to make the most of canned tomatoes. The sauce of porcini mushrooms and tomato can be traced to Piacenza. Each of these recipes offers specific recommendations for the pastas and other foods that work best with them</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Good stock is essential to much of Emilia-Romagna’s cooking. The renowned Tortellini in Broth is one prime example, and most ragù <a id="page60"/>sauces call for homemade stock Boiling stock down to a rich but fat-free concentrate produces a fine stand-in for butter in the simple sauces for Emilia-Romagna’s filled pastas like Cappellacci of Sweet Squash or Tortelli of Cabbage and Potatoes. A really full-flavored stock creates effortless pan sauces from roasts and sautés, as illustrated in Basil and Balsamic Veal Scallops and Lemon Roast Veal with Rosemary</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">While French cooking may call for veal stock in one dish and chicken in another, Emilia-Romagna usually requires only one. But what a luscious stock it is. Traditionally the region’s <span class="underline">brodo,</span> or stock, comes from simmering capon and beef. Capon (substitutions are suggested in the recipe) makes a sweet delicate stock, while beef adds resonance and body. My own version requires almost no effort and achieves good flavor with the aid of a few simple tricks. Quick Stock is a bow to convenience, using a quick and easy method to improve on canned broth</span>.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">The recipes are extremely versatile. Don’t think of them solely for the dishes of Emilia-Romagna. Enjoy them as part of other recipes too</span>.</p>

<p class="chapterHeadB" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Il Sugo di Carne</span></span></p>
<p class="chapterByline" style="text-indent: 5%;">L<span class="italic">iterally translated as “juice of the meat,” <span class="underline">Il Sugo di Carne</span> is an old sauce base that was developed in the wealthy kitchens of the last century. With the disappearance of servants and hired cooks, it fell into disuse. I think it deserves revival, and agree with the few cooks still making <span class="underline">Sugo di Carne</span> that it brings a special elegance to foods. A hundred years ago, when a soup, sauce, stew, or sauté lacked depth or character, the cook often stirred in a few tablespoons of Meat Essences. It was a flavor booster then, and it does the same today. Think of it as a concentrate bursting with the flavor of meat but low in fat. A few spoonfuls can cause a dish to taste as if it has been cooking for hours, when in reality it was on the stove for only a few minutes. This is splendid on its own over pasta, making an elegant meat sauce with surprising lightness. A full recipe sauces four pounds of tagliatelle. A quarter to a half cup brings new dimension to Classic White Risotto and Risotto with Red Wine and Rosemary. Since the essence freezes well and a little goes such a long way, make a batch every few months. Just the aroma is worth the effort of cooking it</span>.</p>

Make sure the stock is totally evaporated before adding the next cup.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Simmering and Finishing:</span> Turn the contents of both pans into a 6- to 8-quart heavy pot. Stir in the remaining stock, along with the tomatoes and garlic. Adjust heat so the liquid is bubbling only occasionally. Partially cover. Cook 6 hours, stirring occasionally and adding more stock or water to keep the meat and bones barely covered. Strain the essences into a bowl, firmly pressing on the meat and vegetables to extract as much liquid as possible. Allow to cool; then cover and refrigerate overnight. The next day, skim off all the fat from the surface, and refrigerate or freeze.</p>

Drink it first as a restorative from steaming mugs on an icy winter night. It is one of the most flavorful and satisfying stocks I know, and I doubt I could recover from a cold without it. The stock also creates the most elegant of openings to a dinner party when served in deep soup cups, accompanied only by spoonfuls of freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Of course ladles of it bring depth and character to soups, stews, sautés, and sauces. Make Poultry/Meat Stock in large quantities every few months, as it freezes with great success</span>.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Starting the Stock:</span> In one 20-quart or two 10-quart stockpots, combine the beef and poultry. Cover it with cold water by about 4 inches, and set over medium heat. Let the water come to a slow bubble. Skim off all foam rising to the surface.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Simmering:</span> Add the vegetables, bay leaves, parsley, and garlic. Regulate the heat so the broth bubbles only occasionally (so you can say “one hundred” between bubbles). Partially cover, and cook 12 to 14 hours, skimming the fat from the surface every so often. If necessary, add boiling water to keep the solids covered.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The long cooking time surprises many. This extended simmering draws all the flavor from the meat and bones, producing a stock with exceptionally deep taste. You can start the stock after dinner and let it cook all night, partially covered, at a slow bubble. Make sure it is bubbling slowly, because leaving it below a bubble will cause spoilage. The next morning turn off the heat and strain the stock.</p>

<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="bold">Finishing:</span> Refrigerate the strained stock until fat hardens on the surface. Discard all but 2 tablespoons of the fat. (In Emilia-Romagna one sign of a proper broth is luminous pin dots of fat called the “eyes” of the broth. Although never greasy, that tiny amount of fat gives flavor.) Pour into storage containers and refrigerate or freeze.</p>

<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">This stock has many variations within Emilia-Romagna, but almost all call for capon with beef, or occasionally capon with veal. I worried about providing a recipe calling for capon, which is difficult to find in some parts of the United States. But when admiring the robust stock of Imola chef Valentino Marcattilii, I discovered that he used turkey wings instead of capon, and the problem was solved. In any recipe, poultry wings make fine stock as they are neither dark nor light meat but a blend of the two and particularly flavorful. So I offer you the choice. The stock is richer with the capon, and I like to use that version when making Tortellini in Broth Villa Gaidello or Anolini of Parma. But the turkey wing version is not a compromise; it is equally delicious.</p>

<p class="boxText" style="text-indent:5%;">Stock is the food writer’s nightmare. Good homemade stock makes dishes sing, but most readers have little time to prepare it. Canned stocks are always a compromise, even when enriched with vegetables and seasonings as in my Quick Stock. Bouillon cubes and sauce base pastes have no place in good cooking. Occasionally supermarkets and specialty food shops carry commercially made salt-free stocks of high quality. One such brand is Perfect Addition, a California-based company. Their Rich Stock—which comes in beef, veal, chicken, vegetable, and fish versions—is found in frozen food cases throughout the United States. For availability in your area, write to Perfect Addition, P.O. Box 8976, Newport Beach, CA 92658-8976, or telephone (714) 640-0220.</p>
