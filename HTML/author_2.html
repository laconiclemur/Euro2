<p class="noindentt">Like most of the culinary world, food and travel writer Anya von Bremzen has Spain on the brain. But unlike those who have recently discovered Spain’s sophisticated flavors and innovative charms, Anya has spent the last 10 years writing about Spanish cuisine and culture. A contributing editor at Travel + Leisure, she has pioneered Spanish cuisine in publications like <em>Food &amp; Wine</em>, <em>Departures</em>, <em>Conde Nast Traveler</em> and the <em>LA Times</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">In her latest tour de force, <em>The New Spanish Table</em>, Anya reveals the Spain she knows and loves, peppering delicious recipes with historical tidbits, cooking hints and true Spanish hospitality. 
In addition to <em>The New Spanish Table</em>, Anya is the author of four ethnic cookbooks, including the James Beard Award-winning <em>Please to the Table: The Russian Cookbook</em>, <em>Terrific Pacific Cookbook</em>, <em>The Greatest Dishes!: Around the World in 80 Recipes</em>, and <em>Fiesta! A Celebration of Latin Hospitality</em>, which won Anya her second Beard award.</p>
<p class="indent">When she’s not in Spain or traveling to some exotic locale to try a new restaurant, Anya lives in New York City.</p>
