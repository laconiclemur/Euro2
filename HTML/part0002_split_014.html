		<div class="basic-text-frame">
			<p class="rec-intro">This is what we call a <span class="italic">pâté grandmère</span>. It’s a traditional country-style pâté and a great staple to have in the fridge for everyone to help themselves to whenever they want. In France there are 101 varieties of pâté and terrines, which can be made in anything from cake tins to parfait jars. I’m never without them. You can make this recipe with any poultry you like and use hazelnuts instead of pistachios if you prefer.</p>

			<p class="serves">Serves 8</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">3 free-range chicken supremes, skinned </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">100g free-range chicken livers, trimmed</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">180g pork belly (fatty), minced </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">1½ tsp salt</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 tsp ground black pepper </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">grated zest of 1 unwaxed lemon</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 shallots, peeled and finely chopped </p>
			<p class="ing-nu">2 sprigs of lemon thyme, chopped</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">50g shelled pistachios (blanched)</p>
			<p class="ing-nu">20–25 thin rashers of streaky bacon, depending on the size of your mould</p>

			<p class="body">Cut each of the chicken supremes lengthways into 3 big slices and set them aside. Mix the chicken livers into the minced pork and season, then add the lemon zest, shallots, thyme and pistachios. </p>
			<p class="body">Line a mould, such as a 20cm cake tin or earthenware dish, with overlapping rashers of bacon, making sure it is completely covered and leaving some bacon hanging over the edges. Press in half the mince mixture, add the chicken pieces, then cover with the rest of the mince. Fold over the bacon rashers to encase the filling.</p>
			<p class="body">Preheat the oven to 200°C/Fan 180°C/Gas 6. Place the dish in a roasting tin and pour in enough boiling water to come about halfway up the sides. Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the size of the mould. Check that the pâté is done by piercing the centre with a needle. The juices should run clear and the needle should feel hot to the touch.</p>
			<p class="body">Allow to cool, then chill overnight in the fridge. Turn out and serve in slices with pickled onions or gherkins, toast and salad leaves.</p>
