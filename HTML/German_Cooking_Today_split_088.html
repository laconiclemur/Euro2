</span></span></p><a></a><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">Sauces</span></span></p><p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">A good sauce should complete and emphasize the taste of a dish without dominating it. Many dishes produce roasting juices or stock during the cooking process which can then be used to make a sauce. On the other hand, some dishes, such as fried or grilled meat or fish or vegetables, do not produce any juices or stock that could be used as a base for a sauce. In this case you can either use deep-frozen home-made stock, for instance, brown beef stock or white poultry stock, or bought ready-made products such as instant stock cubes or granules.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Stock</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> A stock is a concentrated liquid which is used when boiling, braising, frying or roasting meat, poultry, game, fish or vegetables.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> To make a white stock, cook bones, meat, fish trimmings (the pieces left over after filleting), fish or soup vegetables for a long time (2–3 hours, fish about 1 hour) in water seasoned with spices and herbs. Stocks which are made from meat, bones and gristle set as jelly when they cool down. The cold set stock can then be spooned out like jelly.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> To make a brown stock, add a little water, stock or wine to the roasting or braising juices of beef, veal, poultry, bones and vegetables. The liquid is boiled in order to reduce it and small amounts of liquid are then added. The more often this process is repeated the stronger and tastier the stock will be.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Types of sauces</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">1. Basic white sauces</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> A basic white sauce is based on a roux made from flour fried until light yellow. White sauces can easily be varied by adding cheese, capers, herbs, curry powder, lemon juice, white, horseradish or mustard.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">2. Brown gravy</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> A dark basic sauce is based on a roux made from flour fried until light or dark brown. Brown gravy can be varied by adding red currant jelly, cranberry jelly, orange juice, sour cherries, orange marmalade, green peppercorns, red wine, Madeira, sherry, cognac, mustard or crème fraîche.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">3. Beaten sauces</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> A beaten sauce made from very fresh egg yolk, spices and liquid (for instance wine, stock, juice) which is beaten until thick and foamy over a hot bain-marie to which melted, slightly cooled-down butter is added at the end. Here are a few guidelines you should follow:</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">• Preferably, use a stainless steel bain-marie bowl.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • For the bain-marie base, fill a large saucepan </span><sup class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">3</span></sup><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre6">⁄</span></span><span class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">4</span></span><span class="calibre6"> full with water. The water should only bubble very gently (simmering) and not boil.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Place the bain-marie bowl with the ingredients in the saucepan with the water and beat the mixture with a whisk or hand-mixer set at the lowest power until it becomes thick and foamy.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Now slowly add the melted, slightly cooleddown butter to the egg yolk mixture.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Taste with a clean spoon.</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> • Prepare the sauce as near as possible to the time of serving because it collapses very quickly (it can be kept warm for a short time over the hot water).</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Beaten sauces can be varied by adding herbs, lemon juice, white wine, crushed peppercorns, paprika, grated cheese or orange juice. Sweet beaten sauces can be enhanced by the addition of vanilla, ginger, orange juice, lemon juice or white wine.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">4. Cold sauces</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> To make cold sauces, all the ingredients are mixed together when cold (for instance, mayonnaise, remoulade and salad dressings such as vinaigrette). When making cold sauces using raw egg it is extremely important to use only fresh eggs. Keep the finished sauce in the refrigerator and use within 24 hours.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre24"><span class="bold"><span class="calibre6">Thickening sauces</span></span></span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">The base of a sauce is in fact already created during the cooking process. But this base does usually not have the desired consistency, so a thickening agent will be needed. The seasoning will also need to be adjusted when the sauce is finished.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Roux</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Brown the flour in melted fat (for instance butter or margarine) until light or dark brown. Add stock to the flour and fat mixture stirring constantly and cook the sauce until the right consistency has been achieved.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Flour and butter</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Knead together </span><sup class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">2</span></sup><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre6">⁄</span></span><span class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">3</span></span><span class="calibre6"> softened butter with </span><sup class="calibre14"><span class="calibre6">1</span></sup><span class="calibre15"><span class="calibre6">⁄</span></span><span class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">3</span></span><span class="calibre6"> flour and add to the boiling liquid little by little until the desired consistency has been achieved. This type of sauce thickens very quickly.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Vegetables</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Braise some vegetables and onions, then blend together with the cooking juices. If desired, the mixture can be passed through a sieve. This makes a light, low calorie thickening agent.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Flour, cornflour</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Mix together some cold liquid (for instance water or stock) and flour or cornflour. Add this mixture to the hot liquid and cook for about 5 minutes. The aroma of more delicate sauces can often be masked with this kind of method.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Egg yolk</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Mix together an egg yolk with a little milk or cream and stir slowly into the sauce which must first be removed from the heat. Now stir vigorously until the sauce thickens. Do not bring back to the boil because the egg yolk would curdle.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Whipping cream</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Stir whipping cream into the sauce and cook until the sauce has the desired consistency. Cream with a 10% fat content should not be used because it will flocculate over heat.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Crème fraîche, double cream</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Add crème fraîche or double cream to the sauce and stir well. The high fat content will make the sauce thicken beautifully.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Butter</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Stir ice-cold flakes of butter into the sauce using a mixing spoon or whisk. The sauce must remain hot throughout but not boil. Serve immediately because this type of sauce becomes thin very quickly.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Pumpernickel, gingerbread</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Stir finely crumbled pumpernickel or gingerbread into the liquid, bring to the boil and simmer briefly. Then strain the sauce through a sieve if desired. This is a traditional method for thickening dark sauces.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre6">Gravy thickener</span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre6"> Stir in light or dark gravy thickener (depending on the kind of sauce you are making) into the liquid following the instruction on the package. Very quick and easy.</span></p><div class="calibre1"></div><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_88"></div>
