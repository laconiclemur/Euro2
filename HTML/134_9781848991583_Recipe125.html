<p class="acktxt">⅔ cup plus 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 tablespoon unsweetened dark cocoa powder</p>

<p class="acktxt">1 cup plus 2 tablespoons whipping cream</p>
<p class="acktxt">1 large really fresh lemongrass stalk, cut in half lengthwise and bruised</p>
<p class="acktxt">2 small red chilies, seeded and roughly chopped</p>
<p class="acktxt">7 ounces dark chocolate, 70% cocoa solids, roughly chopped</p>
<p class="acktxta">1½ tablespoons unsalted butter, soft</p>
<p class="acktxt">Orange, Cardamom and Thyme Salad (see <a href="137_9781848991583_Recipe128a.html">page 214</a>), made with ordinary oranges, to serve</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindentax"><b>1</b> To make the chocolate piecrust dough, sift the flour and cocoa powder into a bowl. In a separate bowl, beat together the butter, sugar, salt and egg yolk until light and fluffy. Sift in the flour mixture and fold it through gently until it just begins to form a dough, then stop! You don’t want to work this dough at all. Wrap it in plastic wrap and chill 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>2</b> Grease a 7-inch nonstick, loose-bottomed tart pan with a little butter, if necessary. Roll out the dough between two sheets of wax paper until it is ⅛ inch thick. Roll the dough over the rolling pin and lift it over the tart pan. With one hand, lift the dough edge and with the other, gently tuck the dough into the bottom and side of the pan so it fits tightly. Don’t overstretch it or it will break, and press down gently to push out any bubbles. Trim off any excess dough by rolling the pin over the top edge of the pan. Prick the bottom with a fork and chill 25 to 30 minutes to prevent the dough shrinking during baking.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>3</b> Meanwhile to make the filling, put the cream in a saucepan over medium heat and bring just to a simmer. Remove the pan from the heat, add the lemongrass and chili, cover with plastic wrap and leave in a warm place to infuse 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>4</b> Toward the end of the chilling and infusing time, heat the oven to 350°F. Line the tart case with parchment paper and cover with baking beans. Bake 6 minutes, then remove the paper and baking beans, turn the oven down to 315°F and bake 3 to 4 minutes longer until the pastry is baked through and light brown.</p>
<p class="Bodytext-hangindenta"><b>5</b> Put the chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Heat, stirring, until the chocolate melts. Remove the plastic wrap from the cream and strain to discard the lemongrass and chilies. Pour the cream slowly into the chocolate mix, whisking all the time until you have a soft, shiny, chocolate ribbon. Pour it into the pastry case and leave to one side in a cool place 1½ hours, or until just set. Do not put it in the refrigerator, because this will take the shine off the chocolate. Serve sliced with the orange salad.</p>
