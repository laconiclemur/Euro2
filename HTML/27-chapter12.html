<p class="recipe_hdnote"><strong><span class="red">For many, breakfast in Spain is all too often a coffee and a pastry while standing in a neighborhood bar or a roadside café. But when you go for something more substantial, it’s called <em>desayuno de tenedor</em> (breakfast with a fork). This garbanzo bean dish is a classic <em>tenedor</em> breakfast at Bar Pinotxo inside Barcelona’s iconic La Boqueria market. I have spent many mornings at their stainless-steel counter lingering over an order of these before picking up the day’s provisions in the market. My friend, the late Albert Asín, was a fixture at the stoves for the past fifteen years that I have been eating at Pinotxo, and I learned much about the architecture of traditional cooking—building upward from a base—from him.</span></strong></p>

<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">1.</span> If using dried garbanzo beans, soak them overnight and boil following the directions on <a href="258-chapter194.html#page_343">page 343</a>. If using canned garbanzos, drain, rinse, and place the garbanzo beans in a saucepan with about 2½&gt; cups/600 ml water. Bring to a boil, remove from the heat, cover the pan, and leave in the liquid until ready to use.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">2.</span> Soak the raisins in a glass of warm water for 10 minutes; drain.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">3.</span> In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium heat, add the onion, and cook until it begins to soften and turn pale, about 5 minutes. Add the blood sausage, pine nuts, and reserved raisins, and cook, stirring continually and breaking up the blood sausage, until it is completely crumbled, about 4 minutes. (Remove the casing from the pan and discard.) Reduce the heat to medium-low, add the garlic, and cook until the garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Drain the beans and add them to the skillet along with the parsley. Cook, stirring frequently, for 2 minutes, or until the ingredients are well mixed.</p>
<p class="method_txt"><span class="font2">4.</span> Divide among plates. Give each serving a generous drizzle of 1½&gt; tablespoons of the remaining oil, a dash of vinegar, and some flakes of salt. Serve immediately.</p>
