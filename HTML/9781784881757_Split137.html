<p class="tx2"><b>‘There is a <i>dolce</i> (dessert) for every month of the year,’ our chef friend Antonella told me. From the spicy panforte from Siena (see Antonella’s recipe on <a href="9781784881757_Split141.html#page_246">antonella’s panforte</a>), traditionally eaten at Christmas, to the stunning <i>schiacciata</i> cakes (see <a href="9781784881757_Split45.html#page_73">florentine cake</a>) in every Florentine cake shop window in the run-up to Carnevale in February, the summer combinations of fresh fruits known as <i>macedonia</i> (see <a href="9781784881757_Split146.html#page_259">fruit salads</a>) to the <i>pan con santi</i>, ‘bread for the saints’, made for Halloween, there is always a cake on offer to cheer the soul.</b></p>
<p class="tx3">Sugar or chocolate was a rare treat when Giancarlo was growing up and desserts were generally made for a festival or, if you were lucky, each Sunday. Giancarlo remembers that when his family fired up the outside oven to cook bread once a fortnight, his mother would make a cake to take advantage of the hot coals.</p>
<p class="tx">Fresh seasonal fruits such as an apples, grapes, berries, cherries or bright orange persimmons are generally served at the end of a meal. Cheese is eaten at the beginning and instead of dessert (see our ideas for cheese on <a href="9781784881757_Split78.html#page_131">eating cheese the tuscan way</a>). Figs and melons are also served at the beginning of a meal with salty prosciutto.</p>
<p class="tx">Ice cream and semifreddo are not generally made at home. Instead, the Tuscans prefer to dress up and take their evening walk, the <i>passeggiata</i>, which invariably ends at a bar or local ice cream shop – the <i>gelateria</i>. Simple sponge cakes and plain biscuits are designed for dunking and served with bitter espresso or the sweet wine Vin Santo. <i>Torrone</i>, the white nougat studded with nuts, and <i>cantuccini</i> are available in every patisserie and often given as presents when dining out. There are flamboyant desserts such as <i>zuppa Inglese</i>, inspired by English trifle and made with the bright pink Alchermes liqueur, or <i>zuccotto</i> made in a mould with ricotta, chocolate and sponge. This chapter features our favourite desserts, which we believe fit into a modern kitchen, don’t take hours to make or require specialist equipment.</p>
