<p class="noindentb">Top neck clams work best for this recipe, so be sure to ask your fishmonger for them by name. The topping may be prepared several hours in advance. Spoon it onto the clams just before broiling. When opening, place each clam over a big bowl so that you can collect the juice, which can be strained and reserved in the refrigerator or freezer to use to prepare <a class="nounder" href="ach82a.html#page_159">Linguine with Clam Sauce</a>.</p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">12 top neck clams, scrubbed</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 cup plain dried bread crumbs</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup chopped fresh Italian, flat leafed parsley</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit">1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic</span></p>
<p class="recipe"><span class="txit"><sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">4</sub> cup olive oil</span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">1.</span> Pry the clams open and gently separate the top and bottom shells, loosening and allowing the clam to divide, with some remaining on the top shell and some remaining on the bottom shell. Save all of the juice from the clams and set aside to refrigerate or freeze for future use. You should have at least 16 clamshell halves to fill and bake. Arrange the clam-filled shells on a baking sheet.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">2.</span> Preheat the oven to 350° F.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">3.</span> In a small bowl, toss the bread crumbs, parsley, and garlic. Use a fork to stir the olive oil into this mixture. It should be moist but not oily.</p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="red">4.</span> Fill each clam with a portion of the topping mixture, spreading it evenly over the clam and to the edge of the shell. The filling should be about <sup class="sup">1</sup>/<sub class="sub">8</sub> inch thick. Bake until the topping begins to brown slightly, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and adjust the oven temperature to broil. Place the clams under the broiler and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Serve immediately.</p>
