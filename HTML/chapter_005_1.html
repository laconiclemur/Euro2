<h2 class="h2-a">Sweet Provence</h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="smallcaps">DESSERTS HAVE A</span> special place at Christmas in Provence, where thirteen of them are served as a culinary ode to Christ and his twelve apostles. Throughout Provence families have their own selection and, far from being elaborate concoctions, these mainly consist of dried fruits, nuts and nougat. Four of them, known as the four beggars, are always the same: golden sultanas represent the Dominican monks; hazelnuts the Augustine robes; almonds the bare-footed Carmelites; and dried figs the Franciscans. There are dates and chestnuts, and a mixture of fruits both fresh and candied. Fruit cheeses and pastes and sometimes fruits preserved during summer in brandy or eaude-vie also feature. So do the sweet, oval-shaped candies known as <em>calissons</em> from Aix-en-Provence and the citrus-flavoured olive oil brioche known as <em>Pompe à l’huile. La Pompe</em> varies in name and some ingredients from region to region, and is regarded as an essential part of Christmas, traditionally arranged on straw trays in threes as a symbol of trinity.</p>
<p class="normala">The rest of the year round, dessert time in Provence is mainly a feast of fruit. With the exception of Friday which is our dessert day, the sweetness at lunchtime at Le Baou is always provided by bowls full of whatever is ripest: fat white and yellow peaches, nectarines and juicy apricots; teeth- and tablecloth-staining black cherries; or, later in the season, sweet greengages. When I cook with stone fruit I never blanch, skin or poach it, having realised after years of blindly doing this that unless you are to serve the fruit in the syrup that you cooked it in much of the flavour is lost. I’ll now roast or bake it in the oven at a low temperature to concentrate the flavours and caramelise the natural sugars.</p>
<p class="normala">Berries of all sorts are another great highlight of living in Provence. During late spring, summer and early autumn, they taste so much of themselves that they need little or no adornment.</p>
<p class="normala">Sorbets made from any very ripe fruit are a fresh and perfect way to end a meal. I don’t cook or skin any fruit for sorbets. I just purée it with sugar and lemon juice to taste, then strain it if necessary and freeze it straightaway.</p>
<p class="normala">Every book, like every person, has to have at least a little chocolate, and I’ll always make desserts with it in the evenings at least twice a week, no matter where I am. Provence has never been sweeter.</p>
