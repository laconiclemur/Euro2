As we do every year, Joe and I had brought the chefs from our American restaurants—Becco, Felidia, and Del Posto in New York City, Lidia’s Kansas City, and Lidia’s Pittsburgh—to savor and assimilate Italian cuisine <em class="calibre4">in situ</em>, so the “boys” could bring back to their respective kitchens what they had absorbed and incorporate it in their menus. We focused on the classic dishes of Milano and Lombardia: their risottos, side dishes, soups, stuffings, main courses, and desserts. We were particularly interested in the succulent <em class="calibre4">ossobuco</em>, which we sampled in several places and in different variations, but usually set in a risotto with the golden hues of saffron. What truly distinguished the dish, we decided, was the mellow flavor of the marrow seeping from the veal shank bone (the <em class="calibre4">ossobuco</em>) into the risotto, so tender and delicious when properly cooked. Bone marrow is also essential, we noted, to traditional <em class="calibre4">Risotto alla Milanese</em>.</p>

  <p class="indent">Some playful dishes surprised us. A <em class="calibre4">costoletta alla Milanese</em>, one would say, is just a plain breaded veal cutlet. Oh, but not in Milano! There we had it <em class="calibre4">all’orecchie d’elephante</em> (elephant ears): the thick veal cutlet cut in half, and the two halves, still attached to the long bone, pounded thin to look like flapping elephant ears. We also had a one-sided, thick, breaded <em class="calibre4">costoletta con il manico</em> (cutlet with a handle)—the handle being the bone. But I brought back a simpler veal-chop recipe for you, using that meltingly delicious Lombardian cheese, Taleggio (more about those local cheeses later).</p>

  <p class="indent">We all agreed that the food was delicious and the preparations were simple, with a no-fuss attitude. Indeed, it is said that the people of Lombardia are so industrious that to save time they put the <em class="calibre4">primo</em> (a starch course) and the <em class="calibre4">secondo</em> (a meat course) on the same plate—a practice that would be unacceptable anywhere else in Italy.</p>

  <p class="indent">Outside of Milano, Lombardia is a large, productive, and geographically diverse region that I never tire of exploring. Though I love the sea and Lombardy is landlocked (of Italy’s twenty regions, only four are without a coastline), I never sense this deficiency, since there is water all around.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a class="calibre8" id="page33"></a>To the north, like fingers pointing toward the Swiss border, are the beautiful Lago d’Orta, Lago Maggiore, Lago di Como, and the much-less-visited Lago d’Iseo. With dramatically varied topography and microclimates—and studded with lovely villas and castles—the shores and islands of the lakes are among the most picturesque settings in Italy. The landscape is also shaped by its many rivers, flowing down from the Alps and snaking like capillaries through hills and valleys, ultimately to join the mighty Po. Together these waters nourish the nation’s most fertile agricultural plain, the Pianura Padana, Italy’s rice basket.</p>

  <p class="indent">From Vercelli in Piemonte, across Lombardy to the Veneto, and down into Emilia-Romagna, this territory is the biggest producer of rice in Europe. Most important, the fields here are our major sources of Italian short-grain rices, on which our treasured heritage of risottos and other rice preparations depend.</p>

  <p class="indent">There are literally dozens of different varieties of Italian rice grown in the Pianura Padana, but only a few are well known and marketed around the world. Arborio, Carnaroli, and Vialone Nano—all of which have been developed within the past half-century from older strains—are now the leading varietals, most esteemed for their distinctive cooking characteristics. Though they vary in size and composition, all have the tight concentration of starches that are slowly released during cooking, imparting the essential creaminess to risotto while keeping the rice kernel intact.</p>

  <p class="indent">Short-grain rice is not the only quintessential Italian food produced in the Val Padana, which stretches through Lombardy and neighboring regions. Some of the most popular and delicious cheeses are produced from the rich milk of cows that graze on the lush pastures, including Grana Padano, which takes its name from these plains. <em class="calibre4">Grana</em>, meaning “grain,” refers generally to the crumbly texture of the hard-aged cow’s-milk cheeses that have been a staple food in this part of the continent for thousands of years, since pre-Roman times. The first documentation of the production of <em class="calibre4">grana</em> has been traced to around the year 1000 in Lodi, south of Milano. Today, Grana Padano is said to be the best-selling cheese in the world!</p>

  <p class="indent">The Pianura Padana is the area where most of Lombardy’s enormous cheese production takes place, but its boutique cheeses—Gorgonzola and Taleggio—originated and are still produced in the highlands leading into the Alps, where lush pastures nourish cows that in turn yield extraordinarily flavorful milk. (Both cheeses are now also processed in lowland areas of Lombardy, so great is worldwide demand.)</p>

  <p class="indent">Gorgonzola (my favorite blue cheese) evolved in medieval times from a related Lombard cheese, the rich stracchino, which ripened quickly. To age and preserve the cheese, it was stored <a class="calibre8" id="page34"></a>in underground caves, where it naturally developed the blue mold, <em class="calibre4">Penicillium glaucum</em>, and thus were born the first samples of the Gorgonzola we enjoy today.</p>

  <p class="indent">In fact, driving from Milano to Bergamo, on my way to Lago d’Iseo, I often pass right by the town for which Gorgonzola was named—and am reminded of the long tradition of cheesemaking in Lombardy. I always make a stop in Bergamo, a jewel of a city. There I head down a cobblestone street and enter a sixteenth-century palazzo—the home and studio of my dear friend Mario Donizetti, one of the best contemporary realist painters in Italy. It is always a thrill to see the latest work of this great artist. (Mario’s earlier creations can be seen by all. His <em class="calibre4">Crucifixion</em> hangs in the Museum of the Treasury in St. Peter’s Basilica in Vaticano; his frescoes and altarpiece are in the historic Monastery of Pontida.)</p>

  <p class="indent">Yet Mario is no less of an artist in the kitchen. When we cook together, I marvel at the way he handles the gifts of nature. One day, he prepares a simple plate of ripe, beautifully veined Gorgonzola (from a local artisan cheesemaker) paired with some fig marmalade and a torn end of crusty bread. Set on an aged, long wooden table, it makes a delicious still life. When he assembles a salad of perfectly ripe tomatoes, he captures and presents the flavors and beauty of food for his guest, in the same distinct style in which he creates these essences on canvas. Then, with his ever-present wife and muse, Costanza, we eat the still life and talk about life. Our brief visits always teach me something. When I am back in New York, I understand that for me there is no better way to finish a meal than a perfectly ripe slice of room-temperature Gorgonzola with a spoonful of fig marmalade and some crusty bread.</p>

  <p class="indent">Leaving Bergamo, I often go to my favorite lake, Lago d’Iseo, set between the larger Lago di Como and Lago di Garda. Lago d’Iseo is in the middle of the area known as Franciacorta, where Italy’s best sparkling wines, Metodo Champenoise, are being produced.</p>

  <p class="indent">When, at last, I arrive at Lago d’Iseo, there is yet one more leg of the journey: Montisola, a big island smack in the middle of the lake. It is a beautiful and a natural culinary nexus, filled with olive and lemon orchards, and a great lake for fishing products that complement each other perfectly. On one particularly memorable visit, in early summer, my friend Mario and I took the ferry there from Sale Marasino. No cars are allowed, and one can either rent a bike or walk the island, which we did for the entire day. We visited the monastery and peeked into the workshop of the local fishing-net makers. There were fine nets, large nets, blue, green, red nets, hanging from the ceiling, draped on the window, and festooned from wall to wall. I wanted so to bring one back with me, but, alas, <a class="calibre8" id="page35"></a>the fishing net was too large to lug, so I settled for a netted shopping bag just like the one my mother used to carry to market when we lived in Trieste, a half-century ago.</p>

  <p class="indent">For lunch we had lake fish of all kinds—<em class="calibre4">alborelle, agone, cavedano</em>, and <em class="calibre4">tinca</em> at Ristorante da Vittorio. Having grown up on the sea, I do not ordinarily like lake fish, but this day was different; maybe it was the moment, the olive oil, the fragrant whole lemons we squeezed over the fish. No matter: life was beautiful, and the fish was delicious.</p>

  <p class="extract">This tasty frittata has a particularly pleasing texture, light and luscious like a soufflé on the inside, with lots of crust outside, especially when baked in a heavy cast-iron skillet. It’s an excellent brunch or lunch dish, served either warm or, if you want to make it ahead, at room temperature. And this lends itself to many tasty variations: simply fold into the rice mixture a cup or more of sautéed onions and peppers, cooked crumbled sausage, or cubes of Taleggio, before incorporating the whipped egg whites.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Heat the oven to 325°. Grease the inside of the skillet with 1 tablespoon of the soft butter, and coat the bottom and sides thoroughly with bread crumbs. Pour out any loose crumbs.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour 4 cups of the milk into the large saucepan, and heat rapidly, stirring in the rice, 2 teaspoons salt, and remaining 2 tablespoons butter, until the milk starts to boil. Lower the heat, and simmer, partially covered, about 8 minutes, until the rice has a loose custard consistency. Remove the pan from the heat, and stir in the remaining cup of milk, cooling the rice slightly.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Whisk the egg yolks in a large bowl, just to break them up. Pour or ladle in the hot rice gradually, whisking well between additions, to avoid scrambling the yolks. Whisk in the grated cheese and chopped scallions.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> In another bowl, whisk the egg whites and a pinch of salt with the electric mixer on medium-low speed until the whites become foamy, then raise the speed and whip just until they form soft peaks. Fold the whites into the rice batter with the wire whisk, gently turning them over and breaking up any large clumps, until incorporated.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour the frittata batter into the skillet, and smooth the top. Set into the oven and bake for about an hour, until the frittata is nicely browned and a paring knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Place the skillet on a cooling rack, and run the knife blade around the sides to loosen the frittata. Let it set for about 10 minutes before unmolding.</p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page37"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When the frittata has cooled slightly, lay a wooden cutting board over the top of the skillet, hold the two together, and flip them over. Rap on the upturned bottom of the pan and give it a good shake to release the frittata. Present it on the board as is, or invert again onto a serving platter, browned side on top. Serve warm or at room temperature, sliced in wedges.</p>

    <ul class="none">
      <li class="calibre12">
        <p class="textbox1"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_123_r1.jpg" /> The Lomellina area of Lombardy is particularly renowned for its <em class="calibre4">superfino</em> (large) varietals, especially Carnaroli, perhaps the favorite of chefs these days.</p>

      <li class="calibre12">
        <p class="textbox1"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_123_r1.jpg" /> The Vialone Nano, a shorter <em class="calibre4">semifino</em> rice that grows around Mantova in Lombardy, and farther east in the Veneto, is excellent for soups and desserts, and, despite its smaller size, makes fine risotto.</p>

        <p class="textbox1"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_123_r1.jpg" /> Arborio is the best known of the Italian rices (and most readily available in the United States).

  <p class="nonindent">As many of you know, I have for years been encouraging my readers and viewers to prepare risotto the traditional way, patiently stirring hot stock into Italian short-grain rice, a bit at a time. This slow incorporation of liquid coaxes out the starches packed into each grain and creates the incomparable creaminess and <em class="calibre4">al dente</em> bite that are the hallmarks of a real risotto.</p>

  <p class="indent">Well, now I am relaxing a bit, and I want you to do the same!</p>

  <p class="indent">After some marvelous meals and candid conversations with cooks and chefs during my recent trips to Lombardy and Piemonte, instead of preparing the traditional risotto I’ve been enjoying a different approach to cooking the regions’ <em class="calibre4">superfino</em> rices like Arborio, Carnaroli, and Vialone Nano, where instead of the incremental addition of stock, all of the liquid (stock <em class="calibre4">or</em> water) goes into the pot at once, along with the rice, to cook, covered, without stirring. In fact, this is the method of cooking rice that I recall from my childhood. It is usually quicker than a stirred risotto and certainly more convenient, for you can do all the other things you need to get dinner on the table while the rice cooks. And when you uncover the pot after 15 minutes or so, you’ll find the rice is creamy and <em class="calibre4">al dente—almost</em> as luscious as a traditionally prepared risotto.</p>

  <p class="indent">The following five <em class="calibre4">riso</em> recipes from Lombardy all employ this no-stir technique and show the great range of delicious dishes that can be prepared in this manner. Indeed, the possibilities are nearly endless. Here are some suggestions for creative variations in your own <em class="calibre4">riso</em> dishes.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Cook with stock or water: I prefer stock in traditional risottos, but for no-stir rice dishes I use either a light stock (chicken, turkey, or vegetable) or plain water. Stock always gives you a somewhat richer dish, but water will serve quite nicely, especially in <em class="calibre4">riso</em> dishes that build a flavor base with a <em class="calibre4">pestata</em> (as I do in several of these recipes).</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Cook different vegetables or meats with the rice: The procedures here for preparing rice with chicken, lentils, or squash will work with many seasonal vegetables, meats, or seafood. Green beans, fresh peas, favas, diced carrots, or cherry tomatoes would be delicious in the riso. Adjust the timing of the basic recipe so the vegetable is cooked when the rice is <em class="calibre4">al dente.</em> Similarly, you might add shrimp, diced cooked meats, salami, or prosciutto.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Finish the rice with different cheeses (or with extra-virgin olive oil): I often give my no-stir rice dishes a finishing touch of butter to amalgamate the texture, and a final addition of <em class="calibre4">grana</em>—grated Grana Padano or Parmigiano-Reggiano. For richness and complexity, you might add to rice dishes ½ cup or so of either Taleggio or Gorgonzola cut in small pieces, along with the <em class="calibre4">grana</em>, since both of these great cheeses from Lombardy have a natural affinity with rice, in my opinion. For a seafood rice dish, however, I would use extra-virgin olive oil as my finish.</p>

  <h2 class="section" id="c02s01.02"><a class="calibre8" id="page40"></a>R<span class="small1">ICE</span> &amp; L<span class="small1">ENTILS</span></h2>

  <p class="nonindent1">Riso e Lenticchie <img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Serves 8 or more as a first course or soup</p>

  <p class="extract">Lentils and rice are one of my favorite combinations. I fondly recall savoring a dish just like this often as a child; it was comforting and nurturing. It can be enjoyed in many ways: make it dense like risotto or add more liquid to make it soupy. Just rice and lentils are delicious and simple, but you could easily add a few sausages or pork ribs to the pot to make quite a festive main dish.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Raise the heat, pour in the white wine, and cook, stirring, until the wine has almost completely evaporated. Pour in 8 cups of hot water and the tablespoon salt, stir well, and heat to the boil. (Add all 10 cups of hot water if you want to serve the rice and lentils as a thick soup rather than a denser <em class="calibre4">riso.</em>) Cover the pan, and reduce the heat slightly, to keep the water at a moderate boil, and let it bubble for 20 minutes or so, to develop the flavors.</p>

Stir in the rice, return to a bubbling simmer, and cook, cover ajar, until the rice is <em class="calibre4">al dente</em>, 13 minutes or so. If the dish is thickening more than you like, lower the heat and cover the pan completely. If it seems too thin and wet, remove the cover and cook at a faster boil.</p>

  <p class="nonindent">When you are cooking rice, whether by the traditional risotto or the no-stir method, I trust that you will use your senses, taste, and judgment even as you follow instructions. Particularly when your rice is cooking in a covered pot, you should regard the cooking time in the recipe <em class="calibre4">as a guideline:</em> the actual time it takes your rice to achieve optimal creaminess and <em class="calibre4">al dente</em> texture will vary greatly, depending on how much liquid was added at the start, the size and kind of saucepan and the lid you use, what the other ingredients may be (such as meats or vegetables), the level of heat, and even the variety of rice.</p>

  <p class="indent">So, when your rice has cooked the suggested amount of time, remove the lid, give the rice a stir, and take a bite. If the rice is perfectly chewy and creamy, turn off the heat, and incorporate the finishing ingredients. If it is almost <em class="calibre4">al dente</em> or just a bit loose, cook a couple more minutes, covered.</p>

  <p class="indent">But if the rice seems dry—especially if the grains are also undercooked—stir in ½ cup hot water or stock, or more if necessary to loosen the rice, and cook, covered, over low heat for several more minutes, then taste again.</p>

  <p class="indent">On the other hand, if the <em class="calibre4">riso</em> seems soupy—and the rice grains <em class="calibre4">are</em> almost fully cooked—you want to evaporate excess liquid quickly by keeping the lid off, raising the heat, and cooking the rice, stirring constantly, until it thickens.</p>

  <p class="extract">When you want to enjoy a risotto-style rice but don’t have the time for lots of prep and stirring, try this simple recipe. You’ll get the creaminess and toothsome bite of the rice grains and the wonderful flavor of fresh sage, one of my favorite herbs—or use rosemary, thyme, basil, or any other fresh herb you like. This makes a great <em class="calibre4">primo</em> all by itself and can be a delicious accompaniment to grilled or braised meat or fish dishes.</p>

  <p class="indent">I finish the rice with just a bit of butter and grated cheese, but you can add complexity by stirring in cubes of Taleggio or Gorgonzola, or any of your favorite cheeses. (And though I am happy to serve the rice with the sage leaves buried inside, you may pick them out, if you prefer, when the pot comes off the heat.)</p>

  <p class="extract">A warm comforting bowl of <em class="calibre4">Riso alla Lombarda—</em>rice and cheese, with egg yolks stirred in for richness—has long been a family favorite in Lombardy, nourishing children for generations.

  <p class="extract">In autumn, Lombardy abounds in <em class="calibre4">zucca—</em>what we call “winter squash”—and the seasonal cuisine makes full use of the vegetable.

And, like many fruits and vegetables, <em class="calibre4">zucca</em> is pickled with mustard seed to make the delicious condiment called <em class="calibre4">mostarda</em>, for which Lombardy—especially Cremona—is famous.</p>

  <p class="indent">This <em class="calibre4">riso</em> will be delicious made with any of our squashes—try acorn, buttercup, delicata, hubbard, or kabocha as well as butternut.

  <p class="extract">This traditional risotto is a showcase for two of the great foods of Lombardy: the rice itself and Gorgonzola, the region’s superb blue cheese. Here the cheese is more than a garnish (which I recommend in other <em class="calibre4">riso</em> recipes); it is the very essence of the dish. You blend in a generous half-pound of Gorgonzola just before serving, when the <em class="calibre4">al dente</em> risotto comes off the heat, to bring out the full flavor of the cheese, unaltered by cooking. This deserves a top-quality, genuine imported Gorgonzola, preferably not too piquant. I like sweet and creamy Gorgonzola Dolce, aged no more than 3 months.</p>

  <p class="indent">In Lombardy, chunks of fresh ripe pear are sometimes incorporated into <em class="calibre4">risotto alla Gorgonzola.</em> When pears are in season, it is easy to give the basic risotto this wonderful embellishment. Peel and cut ripe pears into about 2 cups of small cubes. When the rice is almost done, gently stir in the pears, and cook for just a minute.

  <p class="extract"><em class="calibre4">Risotto alla Milanese</em>, which my chefs and I researched (and devoured) on our culinary expedition to Milano in 2008, has apparently been a signature dish of the city for over two centuries. A recipe for it appeared in the volume <em class="calibre4">Cuoco Moderno—Modern Cook—</em>published in Milano in 1809, by a mysterious author identified as “L.O.G.” His version had almost identical elements to today’s recipes: rice cooked in butter with onions, bone marrow, <em class="calibre4">cervellato</em> (a type of salami), good beef stock, and, at the end, the addition of saffron. Almost 100 years later, the revered authority Pellegrino Artusi included in his classic collection of Italian recipes a nearly identical <em class="calibre4">risotto alla Milanese</em>, including white wine in the preparation. In twenty-first-century Milano, Artusi’s techniques and ingredients are still the standard (though usually <em class="calibre4">cervellato</em> is omitted).</p>

  <p class="indent">I encourage you to use good beef stock and excellent fresh beef marrow bones to make a truly delicious <em class="calibre4">risotto alla Milanese.</em> The stock can be homemade or store-bought—low-sodium and organic if possible; otherwise, you could substitute chicken or turkey broth. To get the best marrow, ask the butcher for marrow bones cut from the center of the leg bone above the shank. Scraping out the marrow and cooking it is easy. If you’ve never done it, you will see that, as the marrow renders its delicious fat, brown carmelized specks appear. They could be strained out, but I don’t advise it; they provide great flavor, and traditional <em class="calibre4">risotto alla Milanese</em> incorporates them.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When the risotto is fully cooked, turn off the heat, drop in the butter pieces, and stir vigorously until thoroughly amalgamated.

  <p class="extract">In Lombardy, where it’s often cold and foggy, cabbage grows well in the fertile soil and is used in many dishes. The common type here, as all across northern Italy, is the Savoy cabbage—the name suggests its probable origins in neighboring Piemonte, which was once ruled by the Casa Savoia (“House of Savoy”). The loose, wrinkled leaves of the Savoy are great for stuffing, because they’re easy to separate and roll. And they’re delicious in this wonderful dish, mellow and tender but still sturdy enough to hold the sausage-and-vegetable filling.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cabbage rolls are very much part of my culinary heritage. My family grew Savoy cabbage, and I grew up on <em class="calibre4">sarme</em>, the Istrian interpretation of stuffed cabbage. <em class="calibre4">Sarme</em> are a more sour preparation, since the cooking on the eastern edge of Italy had many Slavic and Eastern European influences. The <em class="calibre4">polpette di verza</em> of Lombardy are sweeter (though the wine in this recipe provides a nice balance).</p>

  <p class="indent">Whatever the differences, I love all kinds of stuffed cabbage, and love to serve them at special family occasions. These <em class="calibre4">polpette</em> make a fine appetizer as well as a main course. I serve the rolls in a warm bowl, so the sauce can be scooped up with each bite. For a main dish, accompany them with <em class="calibre4">Riso alla Lombarda</em>, polenta, or mashed potatoes.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To make the stuffing: Pour the milk over the bread chunks in a bowl, and let them soak for a few minutes, until completely saturated.</p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page51"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Using a food processor, mince the pancetta, onion, carrot, celery, and garlic into a fine-textured <em class="calibre4">pestata.</em> You should have about 2 cups total.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour the 3 tablespoons of olive oil into the heavy pan, and set over medium-high heat. Scrape in ½ cup of <em class="calibre4">pestata</em>, and cook for a few minutes, stirring frequently, until it starts to dry and stick on the pan bottom. Crumble the sausage into the skillet, and cook, stirring, until all the meat is sizzling and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Season with 1 teaspoon salt, and pour in the white wine. Bring to a boil, and cook until the wine has evaporated completely. Remove from the heat, and immediately scrape the sausage into a large bowl to cool.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375°. Fill the big pot with water, and bring to a boil.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When the meat has cooled, squeeze the milk from the soaked bread (catch it in the bowl, and use it for another purpose). Crumble the softened bread over the sausage, and combine them with your hands, then work in the beaten egg, chopped parsley, and grated cheese, tossing all together into a loose stuffing.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To prepare the cabbage: Pull off and discard any bruised or torn outer leaves. Cut out the core of the cabbage, and separate the largest leaves from the head, keeping them intact. Lay each leaf flat, outside up, and with a sharp paring knife shave off the raised ridge of the rib at the leaf base. When you’ve trimmed twelve good-sized leaves (and a few extra) for the rolls, slice the remaining cluster of small inner leaves into shreds about ¼ inch wide.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Drop the big, trimmed leaves into the boiling water, and blanch them until soft and quite floppy, about 7 minutes. Cool them in a bowl of icy water; drain well, lay them on paper towels, and pat dry.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Return the big sauté pan to the stove (wipe out any browned bits), pour in the ¼ cup olive oil, and turn on medium-high heat. Stir in the remaining <em class="calibre4">pestata</em>, and cook until dried and sticking, about 4 minutes. Toss in all the shredded cabbage and 2½ teaspoons salt, and cook, stirring, until the cabbage starts to wilt. Pour in the white wine, raise the heat to bring it to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer the sauce for 10 minutes or so, to blend the flavors.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> As the sauce simmers, make the cabbage rolls. Lay out each softened leaf with its shaved rib side down. Take about ⅓ cup of stuffing in your fingers, form it into a plump log, and lay it on the leaf. Roll the bottom of the leaf over the filling, tuck the sides in, and roll up tightly the rest of the way.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When all the <em class="calibre4">polpette</em> are formed, lower the heat under the sauce and place each roll in the sauté pan, seam side down. Pour in the stock, submerging the rolls, heat to a bubbling boil, and put on the pan lid. Set the pan in the oven to braise the rolls for an hour. Remove the lid, and push the rolls down in the sauce, which will have reduced. Bake, uncovered, for another 30 minutes or so, until the sauce has reduced and thickened and the tops of the rolls are nicely caramelized.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Serve in a warm bowl with some of the sauce, accompanied by rice, potatoes, or polenta.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven, and heat to 400°.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Remove all clods of fat from the duck cavities, and trim any loose flaps of skin. Rinse the bird, including the giblets and neck, and pat dry with paper towels.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Sprinkle a teaspoon of the salt inside the belly cavity, and push in the rosemary sprigs. With the breast side up, twist and fold the wing tips so they stay in place under the bird. Cross the legs over the cavity opening and tie the ends together tightly with kitchen twine. Chop the duck neck into two or three pieces, and scatter in the bottom of the pan, along with the giblets, under or around the wire rack. Set the duck, breast side up, on the roasting rack in the pan.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Whisk the wine, lemon juice, and olive oil vigorously together until emulsified, and pour this all over the duck skin. Sprinkle the remaining 2 teaspoons salt over the bird, making sure that the sides are moistened and salted as well as the breast.</p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page53"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Roast the duck for an hour, breast up, then baste it all over with the pan juices, using a bulb baster or large spoon—tilt the roasting pan carefully to scoop up the liquid. Continue to roast for another 1 to 1½ hours, basting the bird every 30 minutes or so, until it is dark gold and very crisp all over.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Remove the duck to a platter, take out the rack, and gather the giblets and neck pieces onto the platter, too. Carefully pour the hot juices from the pan into a fat separator (or other heatproof container), and let the fat gather on top. Pour the good juices out of the separator into the roasting pan—if you don’t have a separator, spoon off all the fat first—then pour in a cup or more of stock, so you have at least 1½ cups of liquid to deglaze the pan and cook into a sauce.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Set the roasting pan over medium-high heat on top of the stove, and bring the liquids to a boil, vigorously scraping up all the caramelized bits on the bottom of the pan. Let the juices reduce until slightly thickened and flavorful, then turn off the heat.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> In the meantime cut up the duck into small pieces to serve family-style: First split open the breast, cutting through the center of the breast bone with poultry shears or a chef’s knife. Cut along the backbone to divide the bird in half, then slice each half into a wing, leg, thigh, and two or three breast pieces. Pile the cut pieces on a serving platter, along with the roasted neck and giblet morsels. Keep warm, and when the sauce is ready pour the pan sauce all over. Let people take the pieces they like the most.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To quarter the duck to serve four: Split it in two as above, cutting along both sides of the backbone so it can be removed. Divide each duck half into a breast piece and a joined leg and thigh, set each quarter on a warm dinner plate, and nap with the pan sauce.</p>

  <p class="nonindent1">Fagottini di Pollo <img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Serves 6</p>

  <p class="extract"><em class="calibre4">Fagottini di pollo</em> means “little chicken bundles”—and that’s what these are. Boneless chicken thighs are slightly flattened, wrapped around a savory vegetable <em class="calibre4">pestata</em>, and kept in shape with a strip of bacon and a toothpick. They’re braised in a big skillet, and finally topped with cheese and baked briefly, to get a crisp <em class="calibre4">gratinato</em> topping. You will love <em class="calibre4">fagottini di pollo</em>, I am sure!</p>

  <p class="indent">You will also see why these make a great party dish, since they’re convenient for a buffet. You can braise them largely in advance—in fact, the flavor improves with resting. Then set them on baking pans, sauced and topped with grated cheese; refrigerate if necessary. When you are ready to serve, simply put the pan in the hot oven to heat them and create the crunchy <em class="calibre4">gratinato</em> effect.</p>

  <p class="indent">Be flexible forming your bundles, since chickens vary in size greatly. If the thighs are small, make more bundles per serving and adjust the stuffing amount and the cooking time accordingly.</p>

  <p class="indent">What to serve with <em class="calibre4">fagottini di pollo</em>? Since they have such a nice sauce, I recommend polenta, <em class="calibre4">Riso alla Lombarda</em>, <em class="calibre4">Riso e Salvia</em>, or just plain mashed potatoes.</p>

  <div class="block1">
    <p class="nonindent"><span class="small">RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT</span>: A food processor; a heavy-bottomed, ovenproof skillet or sauté pan, 12-inch diameter or larger, with a cover; toothpicks</p>
  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Using a food processor, mince the onion, carrot, celery, 4 sage leaves, and the garlic into a fine-textured <em class="calibre4">pestata.</em> Pour 2 tablespoons of the olive oil into the big skillet, and set over medium heat. Stir the <em class="calibre4">pestata</em> into the oil, season with ½ teaspoon salt, and cook, stirring frequently, until it has wilted and just starts to stick to the pan bottom. Scrape all of the <em class="calibre4">pestata</em> into a bowl to cool.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Trim the chicken thighs of fat and any loose bits of flesh, and lay them open, boned side up, on a cutting board. One at a time, cover each thigh with a piece of plastic wrap, and pound it with a meat mallet (or other heavy implement) to an even thickness of about ½ inch. Sprinkle salt lightly on the flattened sides, using another ½ teaspoon in all.</p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page55"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Spread a tablespoon or so of the cooled <em class="calibre4">pestata</em> in a thin layer on each thigh, almost to the edges—use more or less depending on size. Fold the thighs over into thirds, as if folding a letter, and compress gently. Wrap a strip of bacon the long way around each bundle, so the open sides are partly sealed. Overlap the ends of the bacon and thread a toothpick through them to hold the strip in place.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil into the big skillet—cleaned of <em class="calibre4">pestata</em>—and set over medium-high heat. Lay all the chicken bundles in the pan, turning them when the bacon starts sizzling and rendering fat. Sauté the <em class="calibre4">fagottini</em> for 5 minutes or longer, turning several times, so the bacon and chicken are lightly caramelized all over. As they brown, drop the remaining <em class="calibre4">pestata</em> by spoonfuls in between the bundles, along with the rest of the sage leaves, to cook on the pan bottom.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When everything is sizzling, pour in the wine and bring to a bubbling simmer. Cook until the wine has reduced by half, turning the <em class="calibre4">fagottini</em> occasionally. Pour the crushed tomatoes (and juices) all over the bundles, and shake the pan to mix them with the wine. Season with the remaining teaspoon of salt, and bring the braising liquid to a boil over high heat. Cover the pan, adjust the heat to keep things bubbling steadily, and braise until the thighs are cooked through and tender, 25 to 30 minutes, depending on size. (If you’re not sure, slice discreetly into one of the bundles to check for doneness.)</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> If you want to finish the <em class="calibre4">fagottini</em> with a crisp <em class="calibre4">gratinato</em> topping, arrange a rack in the top part of your oven and preheat to 425° while the chicken braises. When the meat is done, uncover the skillet, raise the heat, and reduce the braising liquid a bit, exposing the tops of the thighs. Turn off the heat, and carefully pull the toothpicks out of the bundles. Sprinkle a teaspoon or so of grated cheese over each, and set the skillet in the oven. Bake about 10 minutes, until the <em class="calibre4">gratinato</em> is golden, the bacon very crisp, and the sauce quite thick. Remove from the oven carefully.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To finish the <em class="calibre4">fagottini</em> on the stovetop: Reduce the braising juices in the uncovered pan a bit longer, until thickened to a sauce. Turn off the heat, pull out the toothpicks, sprinkle a teaspoon cheese over each, and set the cover back on for a minute, to melt the cheese.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> To serve the <em class="calibre4">fagottini:</em> set one (or more if they’re small) on a serving plate with sauce spooned around the hot bundle.</p>

  <p class="nonindent1">Ossobuco alla Milanese <img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Serves 6</p>

  <p class="extract">I can understand why my chefs were focused on <em class="calibre4">ossobuco alla Milanese</em> when we visited Milano in 2008, and why so many readers, viewers, and customers at my restaurants tell me it is one of their favorite dishes—in any cuisine. It is, to me, a perfect symphony of flavors and textures and colors: the luscious veal shank meat falling off the marrow bones, the marrow seeping into saffron-infused risotto, the dense sauce moistening meat and grain. And all the richness is enhanced by the counterpoint of a vibrant <em class="calibre4">gremolata</em> topping of fresh garlic, lemon, and parsley.</p>

  <p class="indent">Fortunately, a trip to Milan is not necessary to enjoy this grand meal. With this recipe (and the one for the risotto), the multitude of pleasures in preparing, serving, and eating an authentic <em class="calibre4">ossobuco alla Milanese</em> will be yours at home. The most work may be finding a butcher who can supply the “tall” <em class="calibre4">ossobuco</em> I recommend: ask to have the shanks cut so each <em class="calibre4">ossobuco</em> is nearly 3 inches high (when standing on end). If necessary, you can use the flatter-and-wider-cut <em class="calibre4">ossobuco</em> you usually see in the market. Be aware, though, that the meat will cook more quickly and you will need to reduce the sauce ingredients so the <em class="calibre4">ossobuco</em> does not drown in the braising liquid.</p>

  <div class="block1">
    <p class="nonindent"><span class="small">RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT</span>: Cotton kitchen twine; a small piece of cheesecloth; a heavy 7-quart saucepan, such as an enameled cast-iron French oven, preferably about 12-inch diameter (just wide enough to hold all the shank pieces without excess space around them)</p>
  </div>

  <p class="center"><a class="calibre8" id="page57"></a><img alt="" class="calibre6" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_024_r1.jpg" /></p>

Cut six lengths of twine, each about 2 feet long, and wrap one around the outside of each <em class="calibre4">ossobuco</em>, in the middle (the meat will look as though it’s wearing a very tight belt). Tie the twine securely and trim the ends.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Cut a small square of cheesecloth and wrap up the bay leaves, cloves, rosemary sprig, and juniper berries. Tie the packet with twine. Shave off the peel of the orange and lemon in broad strips with a paring knife or vegetable peeler—remove only the colorful zest, not the bitter white pith. Squeeze and strain the juice from the orange.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Just before browning the meat, salt the <em class="calibre4">ossobuco</em> lightly, using ½ teaspoon in all. Dredge the shanks in the flour to coat all surfaces.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour the vegetable oil into the pan, and set over medium-high heat. Shake off excess flour, and set all the <em class="calibre4">ossobuco</em> in the oil, standing on a cut end. Let them sizzle for 4 to 5 minutes, until the bottoms are well browned; turn to caramelize the other cut side. Flip the pieces onto their round edges, and rotate so the fat crisps all around the shanks. Remove them to a platter when nicely colored—this will take 10 minutes or more.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> When all the <em class="calibre4">ossobuco</em> are browned, carefully pour the hot vegetable oil out of the empty pan, leaving the crusted bits of meat on the bottom. Pour in the olive oil, set over medium-high heat, and dump in the onions. Stir them around for a minute or two, scraping the pan to release the caramelized bits, then stir in the carrot and celery. Drop in the cheesecloth herb sachet, sprinkle on a teaspoon of salt, and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are sizzling and wilting.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Clear a space in the pan bottom, and drop in the tomato paste; cook the paste in the hot spot for a minute, then stir it into the vegetables. Add the crushed tomatoes, stir well, and bring to a boil. Raise the heat to high, pour in the wine, and cook for a couple of minutes at a boil to evaporate the alcohol. Pour in the orange juice and about 6 cups of the hot stock; drop in all the strips of citrus zest and the remaining salt, and bring the liquids to a boil.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Return the <em class="calibre4">ossobuco</em> to the saucepan, standing them on end so they’re evenly immersed in the sauce. Add more hot stock, if necessary, just to cover the tops of the <em class="calibre4">ossobuco</em> with liquid. Cover the pan, and lower the heat so the sauce is perking steadily but not too fast. Cook for an hour or so, covered, checking that the sauce has not reduced and is still covering the meat (add stock if needed). Turn the <em class="calibre4">ossobuco</em> over in the pan so the meat cooks evenly.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Uncover the pan, and cook for another hour or more at a bubbling simmer, adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain slow but steady concentration of the sauce. As the braising-liquid level gradually drops, carefully turn the shanks again, so no parts dry out.</p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page59"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Cook for 2 to 3 hours in all, until the meat at its thickest part is tender enough to pierce with a fork with only slight resistance, and the sauce is thick, reduced well below the tops of the shank pieces. Season with fresh pepper to taste and stir. Turn off the heat. Lift each <em class="calibre4">ossobuco</em> from the cooking pot with sturdy tongs, letting the sauce drain off, and place it on a large platter. Snip the knotted twine pieces with a scissors; pull off and discard. Lift out the cheesecloth sachet, press to release all the juices back into the pot, and discard.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Set a wire-mesh sieve in a bowl or saucepan. Strain all the sauce through the sieve, pressing the liquid from the strips of peel and vegetable bits. The sauce should be thick and velvety, with the consistency of molasses (if it is too thin, quickly reduce it over high heat). Taste the sauce, and adjust the seasoning for the last time.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Chop and stir together the chopped parsley, garlic, and lemon zest for the <em class="calibre4">gremolata</em> just before serving, for freshness. Spoon the <em class="calibre4">Risotto alla Milanese</em> into the center of six wide plates, and nestle the <em class="calibre4">ossobuco</em> in the center of the risotto. Spoon over it some of the sauce, and sprinkle lightly with <em class="calibre4">gremolata</em> (about ½ teaspoon per serving). Serve with small spoons for scooping the delicious marrow from the bones, and pass the remaining <em class="calibre4">gremolata</em> at the table.</p>

  <p class="extract">Gorgonzola and Taleggio are my favorites of Lombardy’s many fine cheeses. Both are made from rich cow’s milk, exclusively from animals that have grazed in the pastures of particular locales. The finest Taleggio, in my opinion, comes from small producers in the highlands north of Bergamo, where the cheese originated centuries ago. Creamy and soft when ripe, Taleggio is a superb table cheese, all by itself or with a piece of good bread or fruit (and at room temperature, of course). On my recent trips to Lombardy, though, I’ve appreciated it as a component of cooked dishes. As I’ve suggested in the recipes, fold it into any of the <em class="calibre4">riso</em> dishes in this chapter—after the heat is off—and you will love how it melts and lends its luxurious texture and complex flavors to the rice.</p>

  <p class="indent">Because it browns beautifully in a hot oven, Taleggio is a great cheese for a <em class="calibre4">gratinato</em>, as you will find when you try this very special recipe. Thick veal chops are browned, then braised in a sage-infused tomato sauce and finished in the oven under thin slivers of Taleggio and a sprinkle of <em class="calibre4">grana.</em> The golden crown of cheese over the tender meat is a perfect final touch.</p>

  <p class="indent">To be sure, this is an extravagant dish and demands the best ingredients. Meaty veal chops are always expensive, and these should be cut extra thick (either rib or, my preference, loin chops are suitable). And your Taleggio must come from a reliable cheesemonger who has allowed the cheese to ripen properly before it’s cut and sold—too young and you won’t get the full flavor. The cheese should be soft under the rind but not runny all the way through. In fact, you’ll need to chill ripe Taleggio in order to slice it thinly for the recipe. But the effort and expense are well worth it, as you’ll find when you taste your <em class="calibre4">costolette al formaggio.</em></p>

    <p class="nonindent"><span class="small">RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT</span>: A heavy-bottomed, ovenproof skillet or sauté pan, preferably 13-inch diameter or larger, with a cover</p>
  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Season the veal chops with salt on both sides, using about a teaspoon in all. Spread the flour on a plate, and lay in the chops to coat on both sides. Leave them in the flour briefly while heating the olive oil and butter in the big skillet over medium-high heat.</p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page61"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> As soon as the butter is foaming, quickly shake excess flour off the chops and lay them in the pan, nestling them all in one layer. Brown them well on the first side, about 3 minutes, then flip them over. Drop the sage leaves between and around the chops. When they are nicely caramelized on the second side, move the chops to a large platter (but leave the sage in the pan).</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Pour in the wine, and bring to a boil, scraping up the browned bits in the skillet bottom. Boil for a minute or so, to cook off some of the alcohol, then stir in the crushed tomatoes and the remaining teaspoon salt. Slosh the tomato containers with 1 cup water, and stir that in, too. Bring the sauce to a bubbling simmer and cook, uncovered, for 10 minutes, to reduce a bit and develop flavor.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Return the veal chops to the skillet, and pour in any meat juices that accumulated on the platter—the meat should be nearly submerged in braising liquid. Cover the pan, and adjust the heat to maintain the active simmer. Let the veal braise about 20 minutes, until cooked all the way through. Meanwhile, arrange a rack in the top third of the oven, and heat to 425°.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Uncover the pan, and if the braising liquid is still near the top of the chops, let it boil down to thicken over high heat for a few minutes. Distribute the Taleggio slices equally over the meaty parts of the chops, and sprinkle a teaspoon <em class="calibre4">grana</em> over each cheese-topped chop.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Set the skillet in the oven, and bake until the cheese is tinged with gold and the sauce has thickened. Carefully remove the hot pan from the oven. Lift the chops from the pan to a serving plate, and spoon sauce all around.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> This dish is so full of flavor that a vegetable with a gentle flavor will do best. I love boiled asparagus spears with just a drop of butter, allowing the veal sauce to flavor them. Braised spinach or Jerusalem artichokes would be very good as well.</p>

  <p class="nonindent1">Torta Mantovana <img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Makes a 9-inch cake, serving 8 or more</p>

  <p class="extract">This traditional almond cake is named for the historic city of Mantova (perhaps better known to most English speakers as Mantua, the city to which Romeo is exiled in <em class="calibre4">Romeo and Juliet</em>).</p>

  <p class="indent">The <em class="calibre4">torta</em> is equally delightful for dessert and for breakfast. In the evening, I like to serve it with poached fruit—prunes poached in rum are perfect—and a dollop of whipped cream. Of course, I make sure there’s some left over, so I can enjoy it again in the morning, with my <em class="calibre4">caffè</em> And since it’s quite moist and keeps well, it will be good the following morning, too (excellent incentive to cut small slices and make it last!).</p>

  <p class="indent">On a more serious culinary note, I want to emphasize the importance of using a fine almond extract in this cake. Indeed, all desserts and dishes that call for fruit, nut, or spice extracts are immeasurably better when you use a top-quality extract rather than a supermarket brand (and never use an imitation flavor). The slightly greater expense of a premium extract is always worthwhile and will pay you back in the flavor of your creations.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Arrange a rack in the center of the oven, and preheat to 350°. Butter the bottom and sides of the assembled springform pan, add the bread crumbs, and swirl them around to coat the insides well, tapping out the excess.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Pulse the almonds in the food-processor bowl until finely ground but not pasty, about twelve quick pulses.</p>

  <p class="extract"><a class="calibre8" id="page63"></a><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> In the mixer, cream the butter and sugar on high speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Drop in the egg and yolks, one at a time, mixing well on medium speed, then scraping down the bowl. Once all the eggs are in, add the lemon zest and almond extract, and beat on high speed for a minute or so, until very light.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> On low speed, spoon in half the flour mix, and beat just to incorporate. Beat in the milk, then the remaining flour mix. Scrape the bowl, and beat briefly until smooth. Finally, mix in the ground almonds for a few seconds to distribute them evenly through the batter. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan, and spread it in an even layer.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Bake the <em class="calibre4">torta</em> for about 1 hour, rotating the pan after 30 minutes, until the cake is golden brown on top and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean and dry (it’s okay if a few moist crumbs stick to it).</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Let the cake cool for 10 minutes on a wire rack. Run a paring knife around the edge of the cake to loosen it from the pan, then open the spring and remove the side ring.</p>

  <p class="extract"><img alt="" class="calibre2" src="../Images/Bast_9780307273413_epub_010_r1.jpg" /> Cool the cake thoroughly before serving. Wrap well to keep fresh for 2 to 3 days. (In the morning, I like to warm a slice of <em class="calibre4">torta</em> to enjoy with my cappuccino.)</p>
