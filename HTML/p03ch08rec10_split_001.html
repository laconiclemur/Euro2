<p class="summary1"><span class="italic">This is the way octopus is cooked and served at fairs and festivals in Galicia. It is a popular tapa throughout Spain, known as</span> pulpo a la gallega. <span class="italic">Octopus needs to be tenderized before it can be cooked. This used to be done by bashing it or by plunging it in boiling water three times before cooking. But now it is tenderized by freezing. In America, it is commonly sold cleaned and already tenderized by freezing. A traditional way of serving is on a round wooden platter.</span></p>
<p class="serve"><span class="bold">SERVES 6</span></p>
<p class="qun">1 frozen octopus (about 2½ pounds), defrosted</p>
<p class="qun">1 pound waxy potatoes</p>
<p class="qun">Plenty of extra virgin olive oil for drizzling</p>
<p class="qun">Coarse sea salt</p>
<p class="qun1">1 tablespoon <span class="italic">pimentón dulce</span> (or sweet paprika) or a little <span class="italic">pimentón picante</span> (hot paprika) or a mixture of the two</p>
<p class="recsum">If the octopus has not already been cleaned, cut halfway through the muscle that connects the tentacles to the inside of the head and discard the contents of the head cavity: pull or cut out the ink sac, the hard oval “beak,” and the gelatinous innards. Cut away the mouth and eyes with the cartilage around them. Turn the head inside out and wash it under cold running water. Remove any scales that may be left on the suckers and wash well.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Throw in the octopus and simmer, covered, for 30 to 45 minutes, or until tender. To test it, lift out the octopus, cut off a piece of tentacle with kitchen scissors, and try it: it should not be rubbery. (If you are not serving the octopus right away, leave the water in the pot and bring it to a boil again so that you can add in the octopus and heat it through before you serve.)</p>
<p class="recsum1">Cook the potatoes in boiling salted water until tender. Drain and cut them into slices about ½ inch thick. Arrange the potatoes in a wide shallow baking dish. Sprinkle with oil, and turn to coat them all over. Heat through in a medium oven for about 10 minutes before serving.</p>
<p class="recsum1">Lift the octopus out of the water. Using scissors, cut off the head and throw it away—it is not as good as the tentacles. Then cut the tentacles into bite-size pieces, and spread on top of the potatoes. Sprinkle generously with olive oil and coarse salt, and dust with the <span class="italic">pimentón.</span></p>
