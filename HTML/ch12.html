<p class="image"><a id="page_216"/><a id="page_217"/><img alt="image" src="../images/12fig00.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Everybody has a secret place, a place that no one else knows of. My secret place is just a twenty-minute train ride and then a fifteen-minute walk from my apartment in the center of Oslo. It is beautiful and quiet—a small clearing in the woods where, from a distance, you can see the cityscape and observe the activity on the Oslo fjord—but these qualities are only the added value. What attracts me to the place, and what makes me guard the secret of its whereabouts so carefully, are the mushrooms. In a small stretch less than a hundred feet long on the west side of the clearing, hidden in between blueberry bushes, mosses, and slowly decaying leaves, there is an abundance of chanterelles. Together with the newly fallen bright yellow birch leaves, they light up the dark ground like gold ore.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a quiet drama and competitiveness in foraging for the golden chanterelles (like the Klondike, but without the wolves and the gangrene and everything that made the Klondike so unpleasant). From early August <a id="page_220"/>to mid-October, Norwegians of all ages venture into the forest to pick chanterelles.</p>
<p class="indent">Nowhere is the national obsession for mushrooming more evident than in Oslo. On Sundays, the subways out of town are full of people with wicker baskets and knives, and the air is thick with quiet anticipation. While Norwegians are normally quite sociable, there is something reserved about everybody as we head out to mushroom. People guard their favorite places jealously and will happily take long detours to make sure they are not being followed. My place is well hidden, way off the beaten path, but still I take all the necessary precautions to keep it a secret.</p>
<p class="indent">When I have safely made it to the clearing, the mushrooming itself is easy. Finding the mushrooms takes a trained eye and not much more. Most of the chanterelles are growing in the shadows amid the moss, and their color is nearly indistinguishable from that of the golden birch leaves. If you think all that shimmers is gold, you will have to turn many leaves before you find enough mushrooms for supper. But once your eye has adjusted to spotting the difference, the rest is easy. Chanterelles always grow in small, circular formations, and when you have spotted one mushroom, you can be sure to find many more close by. During the slow process of poking in the moss and looking underneath fallen branches, I almost fall into a trance, and before I know it, an hour or more has passed.</p>
<p class="indent">On the subway back to town, the mood has changed dramatically. People show off their harvest and the true mushroom connoisseurs tell you to look for rare fungi as well, displaying some strange-looking specimens that they claim to be as good as, or better than, the chanterelles, hedgehog mushrooms, and porcini of everyman. But they will not tell you where to look for them.</p>
<p class="indent">Minutes after the subway starts moving away from Sognsvann station, we are back in the city center. There is a special look to the mushroomers who are reentering town, the blissful expression of people carrying a treasure—and guarding a secret.</p>
<p class="indent">I always feel great when I return from these small expeditions, and cooking the mushrooms fills me with a hunter’s pride. Like almost all true delicacies, chanterelles demand restraint more than technical ability from the cook. Frying them in butter and seasoning only with salt, pepper, and parsley is enough to transport you out of this world.</p>

<div class="blue">
<p class="noindent"><small><strong>WILD MUSHROOMS OFTEN HAVE SOIL ON THEM, BUT THEY SHOULD BE CLEANED WITHOUT WATER, PREFERABLY WITH A DAMP CLOTH OR SOFT BRUSH.

<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons finely chopped shallots</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound mixed wild mushrooms, such as chanterelles, porcini, boletus, and hedgehog, trimmed, cleaned, and cut into ½-inch slices no more than 2 inches long</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons red wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>

<p class="noindentt">In a large deep sauté pan, heat the butter over medium-high heat. Sauté the shallots for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring a couple of times. Add the vinegar and cook for 2 more minutes. Season with lots of salt and pepper, sprinkle with the parsley, and serve.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><strong><small>VARIATION:</small></strong> If you want to be a little bit more adventurous, adding 2 minced garlic cloves, ½ teaspoon chili powder, and ½ teaspoon cinnamon lends some nice spiciness to the ragout.</p>

<p class="noindentt">In a small saucepan, bring the stock to a boil over medium heat. Add the peas and cook for 4 minutes, or until tender; they will not be completely covered by the stock, so stir a couple of times so they cook evenly. Pour the peas and stock into a food processor or blender and pulse until most of the peas are coarsely chopped. Add 2 tablespoons of the butter and process until you have a smooth puree.</p>
<p class="noindentt">In a small skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat until frothing but not brown. Sauté the asparagus and scallions for 1 to 2 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Spoon the puree onto four plates. Sprinkle each plate with the chopped pistachios and drizzle with the sesame oil. Add asparagus and serve.</p>

</div>
<p class="noindents">SERVES 6</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 pound green beans, trimmed</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1½ cups shelled green peas</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ pound celeriac, peeled and cut into matchstick-size pieces</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>¼ cup olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons white wine vinegar</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fine sea salt</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Sugar to taste</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 ripe mango, peeled, pitted, and cut into ¼-inch-wide by 1½-inch-long pieces</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Cook the green beans in a medium pot of boiling salted water for 3 minutes. Add the peas and cook for 3 more minutes. Drain and transfer to a bowl. While the vegetables are still hot, add the celeriac and mix well.</p>
<p class="noindentt">In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, vinegar, and mustard. Season with salt and sugar to taste; mix well.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Pour the dressing over the beans and peas and toss. Add the mango, mix gently, and serve.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindent">The combination of green beans, green peas, and celeriac is not uncommon in traditional Norwegian cooking, but the addition of mango is a modern influence. Norway’s largest non-European minority is from Pakistan, a country that produces fantastically sweet and juicy mangoes. If Pakistani mangoes are not available, any ripe mango without fibers will do. (Fibers make the flesh difficult to cut.)</p>

<p class="noindentt">In a large skillet, heat a generous tablespoon of the olive oil over medium-high heat. Cook the garlic for 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and stir in the anchovies, capers, and half the remaining olive oil. Add the broccoli and cook for 2 minutes, turning so that all the florets are dipped into the anchovy oil.</p>

<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup cooked long-grain white rice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ cup whole milk</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon ground fennel</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>½ teaspoon ground cumin</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</strong></p>

<p class="uln"><strong>Lingonberry preserves (see <a class="nounder" href="source.html#page_294">Mail-Order Sources</a>) or whole-berry cranberry sauce (optional)</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">In a large pot, combine 4 quarts water and the salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Place 6 cabbage leaves in the pot, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until softened but not limp. Remove and drain on a rack or kitchen towel. Repeat with the remaining cabbage leaves. Cut the leaves lengthwise in half, removing the tough center ribs. (You will now have 24 half cabbage leaves. You will not need all, but some may tear.)</p>
<p class="noindentt">Heat 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large nonstick skillet. Sauté the onion and garlic until golden and soft. Remove from the heat.</p>
<p class="noindentt">In a bowl, combine the ground meats, rice, onion (set the skillet aside), and milk until you have a loose mixture. Season with the fennel, cumin, salt, and pepper.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Place 1 cabbage leaf on a work surface. Place 2 to 3 heaped tablespoons of the meat mixture in the center of the leaf and mold the mixture into a rough cylinder. Fold and roll the cabbage leaf over; tuck the ends of the leaf underneath. Repeat until you have used all the meat mixture.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a large baking dish with the vegetable oil.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><a id="page_233"/>Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the nonstick skillet. Add 4 to 6 cabbage rolls at a time, sprinkle with a little sugar, and cook until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the cabbage rolls to the baking dish. When all the cabbage rolls are sautéed, deglaze the skillet with ½ cup water. Boil until reduced to 2 to 3 tablespoons and pour over the cabbage rolls.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Cover the baking dish and bake the cabbage rolls for 25 minutes. Let cool until just warm to the touch. Serve with the lingonberry preserves if desired.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindent">Stuffed grape leaves are an important part of Turkish cuisine. When Swedish king Karl XII, who governed Sweden from 1697 to 1718, spent four years in Turkey, trying to build an alliance with the Turks against the Russian czar Peter the Great, he got to know and love Turkish food. He was particularly fond of this stylish finger food, which he introduced to Swedish high society upon his return.</p>
<p class="noindentt">The dish has slowly been adapted to Swedish conditions: The grape leaves have been replaced with cabbage leaves, pork has been added, and the level of spiciness has been turned down a few degrees.</p>

Add the Brussels sprouts and lemon wedges, reduce the heat to medium, and cook for about 15 minutes, until the sprouts are tender but still firm inside. Check with a fork; you should feel some resistance in the center of the sprouts.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Drain the Brussels sprouts in a colander and rinse for 30 seconds under cold running water to stop the cooking. Discard the lemon wedges.</p>

<p class="noindentt"><strong><small>VARIATION:</small></strong> If you want to be a bit more inventive, add 2 tablespoons drained capers and 4 chopped anchovy fillets.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindent">Brussels sprouts have an almost poetic name in Norwegian, <em>rosenkål,</em> which literally means “rose cabbage.” Up until the 1960s, while cabbage was king of the vegetables, Brussels sprouts were considered a rather sophisticated vegetable, normally served with fine cuts of lamb or game.</p>
<p class="noindentt">By the time I was growing up, though, the aura of refinement had worn off, and I remember with dread the Brussels sprouts served at family gatherings, cooked until almost brown in color. In order to be allowed a second serving of meat and gravy, I had to finish all the Brussels sprouts on my plate. I was never sure whether the trade-off was worth it.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Today, with a wide array of vegetables available in most shops, Brussels sprouts are no longer thought to be fashionable. I consider that a pity, despite my early misgivings. Brussels sprouts can be delicious when they are not overcooked. Sprinkling them with lemon will help keep their color and emphasize the gentle sweetness—making them true to their Norwegian name.</p>

<p class="noindent"><small><strong>PARSNIPS BECOME WONDERFULLY SWEET AND DELICIOUS WHEN THEY ARE BAKED WRAPPED IN FOIL. SERVING THEM WITH SALMON ROE MAKES FOR AN ELEGANT STARTER OR SIDE DISH. WITHOUT THE SALMON ROE, THIS IS EXCELLENT WITH ALL KINDS OF MEATS AND FATTY FISH LIKE SALMON.</strong></small></p>

<p class="noindents">SERVES 4</p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 parsnips, peeled and halved</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 teaspoons ground cumin</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons lemon juice</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>3 tablespoons olive oil</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>1 small garlic clove</strong></p>
<p class="uln"><strong>4 to 6 tablespoons salmon roe</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt">Preheat the oven to 350°F.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Place the parsnips in a small baking dish. Sprinkle with the cumin, lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Cover with foil and bake for 40 minutes, or until soft and sweet. Let the parsnips cool off until nicely warm.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Meanwhile, with a mortar and pestle or a mini blender, crush or pulse the parsley, garlic, and the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil until you have a smooth sauce.</p>
<p class="noindentt">Place the parsnips cut side up on plates. Spoon the parsley sauce over the parsnips, add the salmon roe, and serve.</p>

<p class="noindent">Cumin and its cousin, caraway, have been common in Scandinavia since the thirteenth century, and, for no apparent reason, they have taken turns as the most popular spice. In many ways caraway has won, being the predominant spice in aquavit.</p>
