 CHEESE &amp; CRYSTALLIZED GINGER STRAWS</h2>
<p class="rec_intro_pink" id="nad0000843">
<em>Cheese straws used to be my go-to food for when I was out with the kids. It was what I gave them when carrot sticks no longer did the job. But they can be so much more than just a snack in a ziplock bag. They can be quite grown-up too! I love making cheese straws, because I can freeze them halfway through and later bake them from frozen. These are flavoured with Parmesan, and with a hidden surprise of crystallized ginger running through them. I can’t decide if they are sweet or savoury, so I guess they can be either/or, or both.</em>

<strong>1.</strong>
</span>
 Preheat the oven to 220°C/200°C fan/gas 7. Line a baking tray with baking paper.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000852">
<span class="pink">
<strong>2.</strong>
</span>
 Place the ready-rolled puff pastry on a lightly floured work surface. Sprinkle one half of the pastry with half the grated Parmesan and all the chopped crystallized ginger. Fold over the other half of the pastry and press down firmly.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000853">
<span class="pink">
<strong>3.</strong>
</span>
 Roll the whole thing out to about the thickness of a pound coin, trying to keep it a rectangle shape as much as you can.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000854">
<span class="pink">
<strong>4.</strong>
</span>
 Using a pizza cutter, cut the pastry into 1cm strips. Brush the tops of the strips with the beaten egg and sprinkle with the rest of the Parmesan. Place them on the baking tray and twist them a few times, then sprinkle with salt.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000855">
<span class="pink">
<strong>5.</strong>
</span>
 If you like, you can freeze them at this point – keep them on the baking tray and place it in the freezer, so they don’t lose their shape. Once they’re frozen, keep them in a ziplock bag in the freezer till you are ready to bake them.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000856">
<span class="pink">
<strong>6.</strong>
</span>
 Bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 10–12 minutes, or until golden and crisp. If you are baking them from frozen, they will take 15–17 minutes at the same temperature.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000857">
<span class="pink">
<strong>7.</strong>
</span>
 Take out of the oven and leave to cool on the tray.</p>
<p class="method" id="nad0000858">
<span class="pink">
<strong>8.</strong>

 These will keep in an airtight container for three days if you want to make them in advance.</p>
