<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Hired Men</a>
</h1>
<p class="pf">Anyone who has lived on a farm in northern Minnesota knows that farming isn’t the most lucrative endeavor, regardless of how beautiful the countryside might be. My dad was resourceful, though, and coupled the farming life with that of a lumberjack—not uncommon among Finns at that time. He would lease acres of woods from St. Louis County and then harvest the lumber from that acreage. He hired men to help him out.</p>
<p>When the workload was heavy, extra “hands” were necessary. Isä would hire a couple of guys from “Boy’s Town”—a strip of shacks along the edge of Floodwood, where old bachelors lived when they weren’t helping out on a farm, usually on weekends after blowing their earnings at the local bar.</p>
<p>Although addicted to alcohol and nicotine, these old Finnish guys had a gentle nature to them. As kids, we even loved their names. There was Hippa Heikki, Haapa Koski, and “Pissa Antti.” Henry Martimo and Pete Martimo were brothers who worked on the farm. The men all told us funny stories about animals in the woods, dogs, birds. Simple stories, really. Mummy didn’t like them because they were drunks. Isä thought they were great because they were “good workers.” They’d work all week, expect to get paid on Friday, then would blow it all on booze over the weekend. Monday morning they’d stagger back to work, pants wet on the inside of their legs.</p>
<p>To keep them happy, Isä sometimes had a little extra elixir on hand, which he had the habit of dipping into as well. This didn’t make Mummy happy.</p>
<p>Just because these guys were drunks, it didn’t mean that we didn’t like them. Pete Martimo, for instance, was a really fun guy. When he laughed, he started out with a “heh, heh” that developed into a full-fledged roar. As he laughed, his skinny body vibrated in waves, like the branches on poplar trees. Pete later decided to dry up and quit drinking cold turkey. Mummy respected Pete a lot for that. But Pete’s brother, Henry, continued on with the booze. He was taller, more muscular, and could physically handle much bigger trees. Then there was Andrew Leppi. We called him “Pissa Antti” because he was incontinent, especially when he drank.</p>
<p>One time when all the hired men were sitting around the breakfast table eating bowls full of Malt-O-Meal, Henry Martimo sneezed with his mouth full and sprayed cereal all over me. I looked like a sandblasted ceiling and had to wash my face, hair, and all my clothes before I felt comfortable again.</p>

<p>Some of the bachelors in Boy’s Town were too old for heavy lumberjack work. Isä would hire those men to pick potatoes in September. There was Hippa Heikki and Haapa Koski, and we kids would march around repeating their names because they were so rhythmic. Both Hippa Heikki and Haapa Koski were bent little old men who wore overalls and plaid flannel shirts. Isä would give them a ride back into Boy’s Town at the end of the day.</p>
<p>We housed a couple of other men in what we called the “carpenter shack,” a little building on the farm that held cots, a couple of benches, and a few pegs for hanging their jackets, caps, and overalls at night. These old men slept in their long johns, which Mummy would wash once a week. These guys were homeless men who didn’t live in Boy’s Town. The shack wasn’t very big and I have wondered how they kept themselves entertained, as we never saw them playing games or reading. They would relax outside under the trees when the weather was nice, smoking cigarettes and telling stories until it was dark. Then, I suppose, they just fell into bed, exhausted from their day’s work.</p>

<a class="xref" href="text00004.html#toc">Paul Long’s Wife’s Rieska</a>
</p>
<p class="rpf">Paul Long was a man Isä hired from time to time when he needed extra hands. It was a hot and humid July day in the middle of haymaking when Paul Long and his wife dropped in for a visit. The temperature and humidity hovered at about a hundred.</p>
<p class="rp">Mummy set the coffee table with sliced cheese, butter, and salami with cookies along with slices of Zinsmaster bread. It was a rare thing for us to have “bought bread,” which was a treat for us kids—we loved the “bread that folds” because we had it about once a year.</p>
<p class="rp">Mrs. Long was mortified. The following week she came over with a loaf of rieska and exclaimed (in Finnish), “This is homemade bread made with Occident flour!” She thought we had “bought bread” all the time—and said it was terrible for such a large family to be deprived of healthy homemade bread.</p>
<p class="rp">Mummy felt really insulted. She wasn’t able even to eat Mrs. Long’s bread, she felt so bad.</p>
<p class="rp">Here’s a recipe very similar to Mrs. Long’s bread. It is a simple bread that is baked free-form on a cookie sheet and turns out to be not much more than an inch and a half thick. Even though rieska is typically a quick bread, this one includes yeast for leavening.</p>
<p class="rpah">Mrs. Long’s Graham Rieska</p>
<div class="list">
<p class="rpil">2 packages active dry yeast</p>
<p class="rpil">½ cup lukewarm water</p>
<p class="rpil">4 cups milk, scalded and cooled</p>
<p class="rpil">4 teaspoons salt</p>
<p class="rpil">¼ cup lard or butter, melted</p>
<p class="rpil">2 cups graham (coarse whole wheat) flour</p>
<p class="rpill">6 to 7 cups bread flour</p>
</div>
<p class="rpf">In a large bowl, soften the yeast in the warm water. Let stand 5 minutes until yeast begins to foam. Add the cooled milk, salt, and lard or butter. Stir in the graham flour until mixture is very smooth. Cover and let rise for 10 to 15 minutes until the mixture is puffy. Stir in the bread flour a cup at a time until the dough is smooth and stretchy.</p>
<p class="rp">Grease two large cookie sheets and sprinkle with a small amount of flour. Turn half of the dough out onto each of the two pans. With floured hands, flatten out to about 1-inch thickness. Let rise for an hour until puffy.</p>
<p class="rp">Preheat the oven to 375°F. With a fork, pierce the loaves all over. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes until loaves are browned. Cool on a rack.</p>
<p class="rpy">Makes 2 free-form loaves</p>
