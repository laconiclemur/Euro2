<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bi">During a lunch with olive-oil men in Córdoba, Cristóbal Lovera Prieto</span> said that there was a long controversy about Spanish culture that had lasted nearly thirty years. Was it Roman, or was it Arab? After a lot of argument, it was decided that it was Roman. At a dinner party in Madrid, when I said that I was researching the history and culture of Spanish food, the hostess, Antonieta, said, “You have to know that we are of Roman and Visigoth stock. Did you see the Roman aqueduct in Segovia?” She was angry, she said, at the way foreigners always noticed Moorish architecture and influences. “By the thirteenth century, almost all of the peninsula had been repossessed, and Muslims remained only in the small enclave of Granada.” My reply, a rather earnest recitation of what I had just learned about the Muslim presence in Spain as late as the seventeenth century, must have made her feel that I was upset and perhaps that I saw her as prejudiced, because after dinner she put on a Moroccan belly dancing costume and showed me a recipe for hummus that she’d stuck on her fridge. Spaniards like to see themselves as Romans and Visigoths or Celts, or even Phoenicians. Obviously, these early civilizations have a place in this book.</p>
<p class="para">Early on, possibly from the sixth century <span class="sc2">B.C.</span>, Phoenicians, Greeks, and Carthaginians established settlements along the Mediterranean coast of the Iberian Peninsula and on the Balearic Islands, while Celtic tribes coming over the Pyrenees settled in the north. The Phoenicians created salt pans (shallow pools where seawater is evaporated, leaving salt deposits) and introduced the techniques of preserving fish in salt for their overseas trade and the manner of baking fish in salt. The Carthaginians are said to have brought chickpeas with them. The Greeks cultivated grapevines and olive and almond trees. The Celts were swineherds. They venerated the indigenous oaks, which they believed had magical powers, and chestnut trees, and they fed their pigs acorns and chestnuts. Among their legacies are the cured pork products that have a hugely important place in Spanish gastronomy. They also reared cattle for dairy. When the entire Iberian Peninsula came under Roman rule (the Romans began their invasion in 206 <span class="sc2">B.C.</span> and called it Hispania), the vineyards and olive groves were expanded, and wheat was established in the plains, reaffirming the classical Mediterranean triad of bread, wine, and olive oil on which Spanish food is based. The Romans also introduced peach, apricot, and lemon trees. But their lasting legacy is the Latin language, from which the languages spoken today in Spain (apart from the Basque language) derive.</p>
<p class="para">When the Roman Empire began to crumble in the fifth century, pillaging Germanic tribes passed in waves until the Visigoths, whose ruling families of Germanic origin had been in the service of the Roman emperors, arrived at the end of the century. They established the capital of their kingdom in Toledo. Their king Recared converted to Catholicism in 587, and his successors continued to rule over a Roman Catholic Visigothic kingdom, which gradually covered all of the peninsula.</p>
<p class="para">The Visigoths were stock-raising herders. They kept pigs and let them feed on acorns and berries in the woods and forests. They cooked with lard, not olive oil. They knew the art of salting and smoking meats. They raised geese, kept goats, and made cheese. They also made apple cider, and beer from fermented barley. Their conquered subjects continued as in Roman times, cultivating grapevines and olive trees; grains such as wheat, oats, barley, millet, and rye; broad beans, peas, chickpeas, and lentils; and vegetables such as cabbages and leeks. They had hazelnut and walnut trees, figs, pears, apples, and plums. They picked wild berries; collected snails; raised pigs, sheep, and goats; and hunted deer, wild boar, and small game such as rabbits and birds. Most of their fish came from rivers rather than the sea. There are no documents from Spain relating to the cooking of the time, but foreign travelers noted that it was rough and primitive, that pork was the most popular food, and that lard was preferred to olive oil.</p>
