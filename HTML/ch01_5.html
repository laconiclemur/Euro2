<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">ALMONDS</h2>
<p class="chap-opener">Almonds are the most popular dried nut in Spain. In fact, Spain is the second largest producer of almonds in the world and our almonds are unparalleled. There are a number of Spanish varieties – all of excellent quality – but the best almond has to be Marcona.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">MARINATED OLIVES</h2>
<p class="chap-opener">In Spain we are pretty much born eating olives. Spain is the biggest olive producer in the world so they are everywhere; you can’t avoid them even if you wanted to. I’m always coming up with different ways to marinate them; the possibilities for transforming simple olives into a tasty snack are endless. Here are a few combinations that will not disappoint.</p>

Rub the herbs between your hands to release the essential oils before adding them to the bowl. Give everything a good stir so the oil becomes infused with all the flavours. Enjoy immediately – although they will keep in the fridge for at least 2 weeks. You can reuse the oil as a marinade for chicken or fish, or to drizzle over a salad.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">FRIED PADRÓN PEPPERS</h2>
<p class="chap-opener">These small green peppers are from Padrón in Galicia, northwest Spain, and they are somewhat of a speciality – grab them while they are in season, from July to September. We have a saying in Spain, ‘pimientos de Padrón, unos pican y otros no’. It means ‘Padrón peppers, some are hot and some are not’, so prepare to play the game of Russian roulette; it’s very difficult to tell which ones will blow your mouth off until you have crunched into them.</p>
<p class="recipe-head">SERVES 4–5 AS A TAPA</p>
<p class="recipe-head">PREPARATION TIME: 1 MINUTE</p>
<p class="recipe-head">COOKING TIME: 1 MINUTE</p>

<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> Put the olive oil in a wide frying pan over a high heat and heat until it is just at smoking point. Add the peppers (carefully, as the oil will be very hot) and stir with a long-handled spoon in case any of them spit and burn your hand. In hot oil, they should be cooked in 1 minute. The idea is to blister the skin of the peppers fairly quickly so they still have a fresh pepper flavour on the inside, with a lovely crisp, fried exterior.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> Remove from the pan, drain on kitchen paper and sprinkle with salt flakes. Enjoy immediately, and good luck!</p>

<p class="recipe-list">1 FAT GARLIC CLOVE</p>
<p class="recipe-list">8 CHERRY TOMATOES</p>
<p class="recipe-list">SEA SALT FLAKES</p>
<p class="recipe-list">EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL, FOR DRIZZLING</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> Toast the bread on both sides – use a griddle pan, a grill or just a plain old toaster. If you are doing a barbecue, chuck the bread slices on the grill for a lovely smoky flavour.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> Leaving the skin on, slice off the flat end of the garlic clove. Cut the cherry tomatoes in half.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> When the bread is toasted, scrub one side of the bread with the cut garlic and the other side with the cut side of the cherry tomatoes. Squeeze all the seeds and juice from the tomatoes by grating the tomato against the bread; discard the skin. I like to use just a little tomato but you can use more – it’s up to you.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">4</span> Place the toast tomato-side up (garlic-side down) on a plate, sprinkle with sea salt flakes and add a generous drizzle of olive oil.</p>
<p class="recipe-head1">OMAR’S NOTE</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">When you put this in your mouth, the first thing you taste is the pungent garlic on your tongue, followed by a hit of sea salt, then the tartness of the tomato and finally the sweetness of the olive oil. It’s an all-round experience. Don’t settle for fake <i>pan con ajo y tomate</i> – this is the real deal.</p>
<p class="recipe-head1">SUGGESTION</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">In the Valencia region they make this without the tomato – just garlic, salt and olive oil. Try it – it’s delicious with most things.</p>

Add about three ice cubes – this is to keep the mixture nice and cool as blenders can heat up the contents very quickly. Believe me, it really changes the dish if you don’t add the ice cubes so don’t be tempted to leave them out! Blend until you have a thick dip with a smooth texture.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> Place in a bowl and sprinkle the remaining chopped boiled egg on top. Serve with bread for dipping and slices of jamón iberico. Another great way to serve this is with cooked peeled prawns.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-head-left" id="list7"><a id="pg22"/>MEMBRILLO</h2>
<h2 class="chapter-subhead-left">QUINCE JELLY</h2>
<p class="chap-opener">My family has a house in the mountains near Madrid and it is where we all congregate every Christmas. We are completely spoiled in that you only have to walk out of the house to come across wonderful natural ingredients: mushrooms, asparagus, game, fish, nuts, wild fruits and berries. As you may well imagine, I’m very used to cooking with all of these wild ingredients and Christmas is a great time for making preserves for the year ahead which are shared between all the family members. So, back to the point, here is my foolproof recipe for quince jelly.</p>
<p class="recipe-head">MAKES ABOUT 5 × 400-G JARS</p>
<p class="recipe-head">PREPARATION TIME: 10 MINUTES</p>
<p class="recipe-head">COOKING TIME: 2 HOURS</p>
<p class="recipe-list">3 KG QUINCES</p>
<p class="recipe-list">600 G CASTER SUGAR</p>
<p class="recipe-list">JUICE OF 1 LEMON</p>
<p class="recipe-list">200 ML WATER</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">1</span> Wash and core the quinces and then chop into 3-cm pieces. You should end up with about 2 kg of prepared fruit. Put in a large heavy-based pan with the sugar and place over a medium to high heat. Stir the fruit from time to time so that it doesn’t catch on the bottom of the pan. Quinces are quite hard and unlike other fruits such as strawberries, peaches or oranges, don’t soften or release any liquid as quickly.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">2</span> After about 15 minutes you will see the quince start to caramelize – at this point reduce the heat to low. Continue to cook at this low heat, stirring occasionally, for 1½ hours. After half an hour the quince will start to soften; after another hour it will become more like a paste. It should be dark brown in colour and have reduced to a quarter of the original amount. Add the lemon juice and water and cook for a further 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="recipe-para"><span class="no">3</span> Your jelly is now ready. Pour into clean, sterilized jars; if properly sealed you will be able to keep for at least a year. Alternatively, you can pour into a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper. Once it has cooled and set firm you can turn out and slice into squares.</p>
<p class="recipe-head1">OMAR’S NOTE</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">Membrillo goes very well with cheese – in particular our famous Spanish Manchego cheese. I also like to eat membrillo with fresh cottage cheese and olive oil and often use it in cheesecakes too.</p>
<p class="recipe-head1">SUGGESTION</p>
<p class="recipe-para1">You can also make a softer, more spreadable paste, instead of this firm jelly. Simply add 2 glasses of water to the paste along with the lemon juice and purée with a hand blender until smooth. Continue to cook for another 5–10 minutes and then pour into sterilized jars as before.</p>

Like gazpacho, it’s one of those things that I always have in my fridge in the summer months, and when friends pop over they will most often ask, ‘I don’t suppose you have some of that lemonade you make…’ Don’t be tempted to call this traditional lemonade – it’s my own invention.</p>
