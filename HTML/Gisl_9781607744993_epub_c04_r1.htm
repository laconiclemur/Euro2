    <p class="nonindent1_break"><a id="page83"/><span class="C_COTX"><span class="dk_blue">Few people</span></span> in their mid-twenties would decide to trade in their life as a university student with a promising career ahead of them to become fishermen on one of the coldest and most remote islands in the world. Sacrificing inevitable success in the comfortable city of <a id="ind497a"/>Reykjavík for a precarious life at sea on the Arctic Circle seems a fool’s game. But <a id="ind175a"/>David Sigurdsson had an epiphany in which he realized that he did not define success by the size of the office cubicle he would work in one day or the expensive car he would likely drive if he continued studying economics.</p>
<p class="extract">Success was more than that, and it was worth leaving behind what was safe to pursue his dream. It had been a fleeting vision ever since he was a young boy listening to his grandfather’s stories of how harrowing and rewarding a life at sea could be. It gained more clarity when his brothers recalled adventures of <a id="ind248a"/>fishing on the Bering Sea. In time, fulfilling the dream became more important to David than anything else.</p>
<p class="extract">He is a descendant of a long line of fishermen, and the impulse to listen to his deepest desires eventually led him to <a id="ind271a"/>Grímsey Island, where he met fishing-boat captain <a id="ind557a"/>Siggi Henningsson. Siggi has changed David’s life by imparting wisdom gleaned from decades at sea and by illustrating day after day that the decision to be a fisherman is a noble and dignified one.</p>
<p class="extract">David now thrives in his work, and even during those inevitable times when loneliness and homesickness come crashing down on him, he finds renewal each morning as he leaves the marina with Siggi, a hot cup of coffee in hand, the sun just finding its way above the horizon, and the sea stretched out before him. His days have a sense of integrity and honesty that they never had before. The memory of his past life in Reykjavík doing what everyone else expected of him but he never wanted for himself fades a little more each dawn as he sets out to find the fish.</p>
<h2 class="A2" id="c04-s21"><a id="page84"/><span class="dk_blue">A Conversation with Fisherman David Sigurdsson</span></h2>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Did you always plan to be a fisherman?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">No, I was actually studying economics at the university in <a id="ind498a"/>Reykjavík before I decided to become a fisherman. My grandfather and cousins were fishermen, but my father wasn’t, so it ended up skipping a generation. My father was an electrical engineer and my mother comes from a long line of fishermen, but I think she thought I would have a better life doing something other than fishing. Once I made the decision to do it, I didn’t tell her about it for four months, because I knew she would be upset. It was easy to keep the secret for a while, as she lives in Seattle. I was nervous about telling her, and at first she reacted the way I thought she would. But now she sees that I love my job, and I think she has come to peace with my decision.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Why did you make the decision to move to Grímsey and fish?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">I was the youngest child, and my parents let my older brothers get away with a lot. Each one fished on the Bering Sea for ten years, and my parents were always worried about them. With me they were much more protective and wouldn’t let me do anything. Now I’m a fisherman and I have all the freedom I want. The fishing tradition is engrained in our society. It’s in our blood, and it’s who we are. I am at peace now that I’m out on the water. I feel connected to my ancestors in a way I never would have if I had made the decision to work in a cubicle my entire life. I get back to Reykjavík three to four times a year, but that’s enough. I like my life now.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> What is the most difficult aspect to being a fisherman on the Arctic Circle?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">The hardest part is waking up in the morning before dawn, but once I’m awake and out on the water, I love every part of it. The rocking of the boat is so soothing, and even though the work is hard, it’s honest and rewarding and produces results every single day. You can’t beat that kind of job. Sometimes it does get lonely here. I miss my friends and family, but it’s always the people I miss, never my old lifestyle. In my other life, I always felt confused and empty. But now I feel like each day has a meaning and a purpose. I have a sense of direction I never had before, and I am calm and relaxed out here on the water.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> <a id="page85"/>How did you meet <a id="ind558a"/>Siggi <a id="ind301a"/>Henningsson, the owner of the fishing boat?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">When I moved to Grímsey, I didn’t yet have a job as a fisherman, so I was working in the local fish market. A few years ago he took me on as his first mate. It’s just the two of us, and I’ve learned so much from him. His family owns two boats, and I feel honored to be a part of it. This boat is named after his grandfather, who was lost at sea fishing on a boat with sails. The family has a long fishing history in Grímsey, and he is so knowledgeable about every aspect of the industry. His brother Henning owns the fish-processing warehouse on the island, so I’m learning about that aspect of the business, too. I’ve also learned about fishing quotas from Siggi. The government regulates your taxes based on how much fish you catch and how much it’s selling for at the market. It also puts a limit on how much you can catch. It’s a very strict system.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> What’s a typical day like for you?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">We set out at between three and four o’clock in the morning. The distance we go out varies depending on the weather and the season. Sometimes we go out from the harbor only three to four miles; other times we travel up to forty miles to find the fish. The lines used to be baited by hand, but now we use an electric baiting machine. The bait is from Asia, and we usually use squid. On average, we put out twelve lines a day in different spots, and each one contains six hundred hooks. They’re dropped at between sixty and six hundred feet, and there’s so much lava on the ocean floor, that it’s easy for the lines to get caught up in it, which can be a real headache.</p>
<p class="Answer">We leave the lines out for two and a half to three hours and then pull them up. We process each fish differently, depending on what it is. Skate is thrown back, as there’s not much market demand for it. The exception is Christmastime, when many families traditionally eat fermented skate on December 23. Some days are boom times, with the fish flying in. On other days, we catch next to nothing, which can be depressing. But that’s the life of a fisherman. You never know.</p>
<p class="question"><span class="dk_blue"><strong><span class="span_Q">Q</span> Do you ever miss your old life?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Answer">I do get cabin fever sometimes living on such a small island, but then I get back on the water and that feeling disappears. It’s a good life.</p>

<div class="Essays" id="c04-eass5">
<p class="Essays_header"><span class="dk_blue"><a id="ind10a"/>VISITING GRÍMSEY ISLAND</span></p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">Travel to remote Grímsey requires either a short plane ride from the northern mainland town of Akureyri or a longer flight from <a id="ind499a"/>Reykjavík (daily in summer and less frequently in winter) or a three-hour ferry ride (a few times weekly in summer and less often in winter) from the northern mainland town of <a id="ind170a"/>Dalvík, about a five-hour drive from Reykjavík. The trip through the North Atlantic can be choppy, so be prepared with motion-sickness medication, even if you’re not prone to seasickness. The rocky tossing can bring down even someone with the most stalwart constitution.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">Once you arrive, everything is within a short walk of the ferry terminal, including what most people come to do: visit the sign indicating the line of the Arctic Circle that slices through the island. There’s one restaurant on Grímsey serving a variety of beer and spirits and local specialties like seabird, whale steaks, and seabird eggs boiled to order, plus continental offerings for the less adventurous. Next door is a sundries market, and a few steps away are the only two guesthouses on the island, both of which are inviting.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">Most people arrive on the noon ferry and leave four hours later when it departs, but for those inclined to dig deeper into a place, staying overnight affords experiences that you won’t soon forget. Perhaps you will take in a cake auction at the local town hall, or you’ll watch a seabird-egg collector as he descends the side of an impossibly tall cliff overlooking an ominous sea. Island life can feel remote and desolate if you let the isolation of it all creep in. But if you allow yourself to marvel at the strength and kinship of the local community, your faith in the resiliency, resourcefulness, and will of the human spirit will be renewed, and you will leave yearning for another visit to Grímsey.</p>

<div class="yield">MAKES ABOUT 12 CUPS (2.8 L) <span class="yield_pipe">|</span> PREPARATION TIME: 1¾ HOURS</div>
<div class="headnote">Fish stock is a natural by-product of the fish that is caught on <a id="ind272a"/>Grímsey. In this recipe, Gunnar’s addition of fennel adds a subtle anise flavor, and the celery root delivers an earthy counterpoint to the fennel. Be sure to rinse the fish bones well under cold running water to rid them of any blood and residue, or the stock will be cloudy and have an off flavor. Like the other stocks in this book, this stock can be frozen. Your future cooking self will thank you later for making a large batch of it.</div>

<div class="headnote">In Icelandic kitchens, lamb bones are frequently substituted for veal bones. Each type contains a substantial amount of gelatin, which thickens the stock as it is leached from the bones during cooking. When sourcing the bones, try to secure a mix of feet, breast, and leg bones. The feet contain the most gelatin, so be sure to seek out as many as you can to ensure a rich and viscous result.</div>

<div class="yield">MAKES ABOUT 1 QUART (960 ML) <span class="yield_pipe">|</span> PREPARATION TIME: ABOUT 30 MINUTES (PLUS 1 WEEK TO PICKLE THE FENNEL)</div>
<div class="headnote">Fennel pickled in beer mellows the anise flavor of the vegetable and infuses the liquid with a subtle licorice note. Gunnar uses a dark Icelandic beer called Móri that has a hint of caramel running through it, but any dark porter will work. This side dish is delightfully flexible, pairing well with everything from duck breast, beef roast, or pork loin to roasted chicken. It’s also nice with mashed potatoes or fish from <a id="ind273a"/>Grímsey, which is Gunnar’s preference. Onions are a good substitution for the fennel and can be prepared in the same manner.</div>
<div class="ingredient">
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1 pound (450 g) fennel bulbs</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>1 to 3 sprigs dill</strong></p>

<p class="IL_item"><strong>1½ tablespoons yellow mustard seeds</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Salt</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">Prepare an ice bath. Bring a saucepan of salted water to a boil over high heat. While the water is heating, cut off the stalks and fronds from each fennel bulb and trim the bottom. Cut each bulb in half lengthwise, leaving the core intact so the halves hold together. Drop the halved bulbs into the boiling water and simmer for about 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bulbs to the ice bath, immersing them. Let stand until chilled. Drain the bulbs, place them in a large, widemouthed glass jar, and add the dill.</div>
<div class="method">Combine the vinegar, beer, and sugar in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Add the mustard seeds, remove from the heat, season with salt, and pour the hot liquid over the fennel and dill, immersing them. You may need to weight the fennel down with a small bowl, plate, or kitchen weight to keep it immersed in the liquid as the liquid cools. Let cool to room temperature, then cap tightly and store in a cool place for 1 week before using.</div>

<p class="Essays_nonindent">Hay has been a fundamental part of Icelandic agriculture since the arrival of the first settlers in their longships. Gunnar transports the pastoral aroma of the Icelandic countryside into his kitchen by hay smoking everything from arctic char and cheese to lamb and oil. The technique is a simple one, but the resulting flavor and aroma are immense. Sometimes for dramatic effect, Gunnar will fill a barrel to the brim with hay, position it in front of Dill’s floor-to-ceiling windows, with the restaurant’s bird sanctuary visible behind it, and then ignite the hay. It’s a sight to behold, as the senses awake to the sweet smell of hay filling every corner of the restaurant.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">If you live outside of a metropolitan area, sourcing hay may not be as difficult as you might think. A local farmer will likely be happy to sell you a bale of hay, and it’s a good way to make friends with a neighbor. A bale is a large amount of hay to contend with, but if you have a garage, store it there and then just grab a few handfuls whenever you want to to do a little hay smoking. If you live in a city, going on a day trip in search of a hay supply can be a challenging and fun experience.</p>

<div class="headnote">One of the workhorse fish of Icelandic cuisine, haddock is enjoyed both fresh and smoked. Smoked haddock should be easy to source from most fishmongers, but if finding it proves a challenge, any smoked white fish can be used in this recipe. Just before serving, the fish is broken into pieces and added to the consommé, which warms it and infuses it with flavor. The hay smoked oil is not necessary, but the hay does impart a pleasing pastoral note. Dried leaves or wood chips can be used in place of the hay. Gunnar uses cod bones in his consommé, but the bones from the smoked haddock will suffice. Using the bread from yesterday (or any stale bread you have on hand) is a good way to use up an ingredient that might otherwise be tossed out and reflects Gunnar’s resourceful nature.</div>

<div class="method">To make the consommé, place a frying pan over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add the cod head and bones and fry, stirring often, until very dark but not burned. Transfer the contents of the frying pan to a saucepan, add water to cover by 2 inches (5 cm), and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, skimming any residue that forms on the surface. Lower the heat to medium to maintain a slow, steady simmer and add the carrot, celery root, fennel, celery, shallots, and lemon thyme. Continue to simmer, uncovered, for 45 minutes, skimming the surface as necessary.</div>
<div class="method">Prepare an ice bath. When the consommé is ready, remove the pan from the heat and nest it in the ice bath until the consommé is chilled, skimming the surface as it cools. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a container, season with salt, cover, and refrigerate, then reheat gently just before serving (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-note17">see notes</a>).</div>

<div class="headnote1">Everything is saved at Dill and that includes onion peels. The staff dries them by collecting them in a container near the oven and letting the oven’s residual heat do the work. It takes a few days to dry the peels completely. If you live in a humid area, it will probably take longer. Garlic peels work well, too.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent">The vinegar jelly in this recipe makes for an elegant presentation, but if you want to forgo this step, reducing the vinegar by half and drizzling it over the finished dish is an easy alternative. Salmon roe can be substituted for the lumpfish roe in the smoked mayonnaise, and the mayonnaise, with or without the roe, is also delicious on sandwiches. The use of grated fresh horseradish in this recipe reflects Gunnar’s desire to create dishes with big flavors. Be conservative when grating, as the horseradish can really make your nose tickle if you add too much.</div>

<div class="method">To make the smoked oil, pour the oil into a glass container. Put the onion peels in a second metal container large enough to contain the container holding the oil. Place the containers over high heat. Ignite the onion peels with a kitchen torch, quickly set the oil container on top, and cover the larger container with either a tight-fitting lid or with aluminum foil, which will cut off the oxygen and reduce the flame to a smoldering cloud of onion aroma. Remove the lid or foil after 30 minutes, when the smoke has subsided. If a more intense smokiness is desired, repeat the process once or twice. Let the oil cool to room temperature, then transfer to a squeeze bottle. It will keep at room temperature for up to 1 month.</div>
<div class="method"><a id="page99"/>To make the mayonnaise, in a bowl, whisk the egg yolk until blended. Then, whisking constantly, slowly add the smoked oil, drop by drop, until the mixture begins to thicken. Add the remaining oil in a slow, steady stream while whisking vigorously to form a mayonnaise. Season with salt and vinegar. The mayonnaise will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Gently fold in the roe when ready to use.</div>
<div class="method">To make the vinegar jelly, combine the vinegar, water, and sugar in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Add the <a id="ind4a"/>agar agar while whisking constantly. Boil for 1 minute, then remove from the heat, add the gelatin, and whisk until completely dissolved. Pour into a 9 by 13-inch (23 by 33-cm) baking sheet, forming a layer ⅛ inch (3 mm) deep. Be sure the bottom of the pan is completely flat and even or the jelly will be difficult to remove from it. Cover and refrigerate until well chilled and set.</div>
<div class="method">Cut the jelly into 2-inch (5-cm) squares, then, using a small offset spatula, carefully transfer the squares to a large tray. Spoon a small amount of the smoked mayonnaise down the center of each square. Using the offset spatula to lift the edge, roll up the square into a cylinder. Place the cylinders, seam side down, on a clean tray, cover, and refrigerate until ready to serve.</div>
<div class="method">To make the horseradish cream, put the shallot, bay leaf, and thyme in a dry saucepan over medium heat and toast until the bay is aromatic and the shallots have begun to sweat. Add the vinegar and simmer over medium-high heat for about 1 minute, until the vinegar has almost completely evaporated. Add the cream and cook until reduced by half. Remove from the heat and grate in horseradish to taste. Be judicious with this step, as the flavor of fresh horseradish is very intense and might overwhelm some palates. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl and season with salt and more vinegar. Just before serving, whisk in the xanthan gum to thicken.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, place the vinegar jelly rolls on a plate, top them with the mix of herbs and salad leaves, and pour the horseradish cream on top.</div>

<div class="headnote">Plaice is the largest commercially caught flatfish in Europe and is a prominent item on the Dill menu. Gunnar loves it for its delicate flavor and the versatility it affords. Plaice grows quite large in the frigid waters surrounding Iceland, but its smaller incarnations are widely available throughout America and Europe. Should you have trouble sourcing it, flounder makes an excellent substitute. Virtually any large-leaved herb such as sage or chicory, or even bitter greens such as arugula or mizuna, can be used in place of tarragon for the tempura, which is a fun and unexpected way to showcase herbs in a dish. The silky, herbaceous character of the <a id="ind374a"/><a id="ind621a"/>tarragon mayonnaise brings everything together. The mayonnaise also makes a nice addition to burgers or wraps.</div>

They are extremely controversial foods that incite emotional responses from tourists who see items such as horse sausage, horse steaks, smoked whale, and whale steaks on restaurant menus or discover whale jerky for sale in souvenir shops. Gunnar makes the argument that these meats are consumed as a means of survival in many remote villages, and that eating them does not strike the same emotional cord with Icelanders as it does with most visitors, because they have long been part of the national table.</p>
<p class="Essays_nonindent">Whale hunting is highly regulated in Iceland, and every portion of the whale is used. It is illegal to hunt whale species that are endangered or threatened. This book does not endorse whale hunting, but it is important that readers understand how Icelanders view the hunt and the consumption.</p>

<div class="headnote1">When <a id="ind275a"/>Grímsey Island fisherman <a id="ind559a"/>Siggi Henningsson fishes on the Arctic Circle, he tries to keep everything he catches. Unfortunately, there is so little demand for skate (a member of the ray family) that he usually tosses any that turn up on his lines back into the sea. Skate is seen as high-maintenance compared with other ocean fish. In fact, it is so reviled by some that it has been called a garbage fish. Not surprisingly, Gunnar, who is always seeking out foods that others have deemed a waste of time, is a big fan of skate, insisting that once cooks learn how to handle skate properly in the kitchen, they will be rewarded with its great flavor.</div>
<div class="headnote_indent">One of the biggest time-saving steps you can take is to ask your fishmonger to sell you a skate wing (preferably skinned), so you avoid the task of removing the spine and other bones—a big kitchen headache. Should your fishmonger really like you, he or she might also remove the gristle located inside the wing, which acts like a giant pin bone separating a single wing into two pieces. If you get your skate home and the gristle is still there, simply remove it by cutting it away with a sharp boning knife. With the skin and spine removed and the wing separated, you are ready to enjoy skate as much as Gunnar does. One thing you might never want to do with skate though is ferment it the way Icelanders do on December 23 to commence the Christmas season. The smell is enough to give skate a bad name all over again.</div>

</div>
<div class="method">To make the skate wing, rinse the skate under cold running water to remove any residue, then pat dry with paper towels. Wrap a baking sheet with plastic wrap. Put the skate in a large pot, add the tea, and pour in enough water to cover the skate by 2 inches (5 cm). Place over high heat, bring to a simmer, reduce to medium-low and gently simmer for 8 to 10 minutes, until the flesh is falling from the bones. The timing depends on the <a id="page105"/>thickness of the skate wing. Drain the skate, pat dry, and while it is still hot, place it on the plastic wrap–covered baking sheet. Cover well with a second sheet of plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature for 6 minutes. This step will loosen the skin from the flesh. Peel the skin away, if it has not already been removed by your fishmonger, then remove the flesh from the bones with an offset spatula. Season the flesh with salt.</div>
<div class="method">To make the braised kale, bring a saucepan of salted water to a boil. While the water is heating, separate the kale stems from the leaves, then coarsely chop the leaves. Reserve the stems and leaves separately. Add the stalks to the boiling water, blanch for 30 seconds, and then drain well and chop finely. Melt the butter in a pot over medium heat. Add the shallot and sauté for about 7 minutes, until caramelized. Add the kale leaves and stems and sauté for a few minutes until tender and bright green. Season with salt and powdered seaweed. Keep warm.</div>
<div class="method">To make the shallot puree, preheat the oven to 200°F (95°C). Arrange the shallots in a single layer a small baking dish, sprinkle with powdered seaweed, and add just enough oil to barely cover them. Seal the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 1 to 1½ hours, until the shallots are tender. Remove from the oven and drain carefully, reserving the shallots and oil separately. Put the shallots in a blender and process at high speed, adding enough of the reserved oil to form a smooth puree. Season with salt and vinegar.</div>
<div class="method">To make the skyr foam, melt enough butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat to coat the pan bottom lightly. Add the shallot, garlic, and thyme and sauté for about 7 minutes, until the shallots and garlic are caramelized. Add the vinegar and continue to cook until the vinegar has evaporated. Add the wine and cook until reduced by three-fourths. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together the skyr and milk. Once the wine has reduced, turn down the heat to medium, add the skyr mixture, and continue to simmer, stirring constantly. The skyr and milk will separate during this step but will come back together in the next.</div>
<div class="method">Transfer the mixture to a blender and begin processing on low speed to prevent the hot mixture from splattering. Once the elements are incorporated, increase the speed to high and continue to process until smooth. Season with salt, add the soy lecithin, and process on high speed to create a foam.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, put a spoonful of the the shallot puree on a plate, arrange the skate and kale around the puree, and garnish with the skyr foam.</div>

<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">For this recipe, Gunnar uses a <a id="ind623a"/>tea blend of Icelandic herbs called Witch’s Brew, but any herbal tea you like will work. Herbal tea is big business in Iceland, where the terrain is covered with herbal treasures like sorrel, arctic thyme, and angelica. Most tea lovers in the nation have their own blend that they forage and dry themselves. It’s a good project for any tea aficionado with access to wild herbs.</span></p>

<div class="headnote">No, Gunnar is not calling for a dinosaur part when he includes <a id="ind240a"/>pterygiophores in an ingredients list. A pterygiophore is actually the place where the fish fin connects to the body in most species. It is something that most others would never consider cooking, but Gunnar knows that a little roasting can turn it into an addictive snack. Here, he uses pterygiophores for garnish, but they are also wonderful paired with one of the mayonnaise recipes in this book. Your fishmonger might give you a quizzical look when you first request pterygiophores, but it’s a safe bet that after he or she gets past the initial shock, you will get them at a steep discount—or perhaps even for free, which is what happened when they were sought out for testing this recipe. The other elements in this dish are not as unusual, and when all of them are brought together on a plate, they form a perfectly orchestrated mélange of creamy, briny, salty, sweet, and crunchy.</div>

<p class="IL_item"><strong>¾ cup (180 ml) heavy cream</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Salt</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item_space"><strong>4 roasted plaice pterygiophores, for garnish (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-note20">see notes</a>)</strong></p>
<p class="IL_item"><strong>Old man’s pepper, for garnish (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-note20">see notes</a>)</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="method">To make the plaice, preheat the oven to 325°F (165°C). Arrange the plaice portions on a baking sheet and drizzle evenly with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing it directly onto the surface of the fish, and bake for 14 to 16 minutes, until cooked through. Season with salt.</div>
<div class="method"><a id="page109"/>To make the shrimp, in a bowl, toss the shrimp with the oil, cider vinegar, and a little salt. Let stand at room temperature for about 30 minutes, until the shrimp turn pink and the acid has “cooked” the shrimp as for ceviche.</div>
<div class="method">To make the cauliflower puree, preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Melt 3½ tablespoons of the butter. In a bowl, toss the cauliflower florets with 2 tablespoons of the butter, coating evenly, then season with salt and cider vinegar. Spread the cauliflower on a small baking sheet, place in the oven, and roast for about 25 minutes, until charred and deeply caramelized on the outside.</div>
<div class="method">Transfer the cauliflower to a blender, add the milk and the remaining 1½ tablespoons butter, and process on high speed until smooth. Taste and adjust with salt and cider vinegar if needed.</div>
<div class="method">To make the raw cauliflower, prepare an ice bath. Using a mandoline (<a class="hlink" href="Gisl_9781607744993_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03-note13">see notes</a>), slice the cauliflower core as thinly as possible. Reserve the slices in the ice bath until ready for serving to prevent browning. Just before serving, drain, pat dry with paper towels, and season with oil, cider vinegar, and salt.</div>
<div class="method">To make the almonds, preheat the oven to 325°F (165°C). Combine the almonds, water, sugar, and salt in a bowl, toss to mix well, then spread out on a small baking sheet. Roast the nuts, tossing them every few minutes to prevent burning, for about 10 minutes, until all of the liquid has evaporated. Pour onto a plate to cool.</div>
<div class="method">To make the shrimp sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp shells and fry until they begin to caramelize. Add the carrot, shallot, fennel, celery, dill, and thyme and sauté for about 5 to 8 minutes, until the vegetables are caramelized and the herbs are aromatic. Add the beer vinegar and simmer until almost evaporated. Add the water, stock, and cream and simmer for 20 minutes, until rich, thick, and deeply flavorful. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve and season with salt and beer vinegar. Keep warm. Just before serving, froth with an immersion blender, if desired.</div>
<div class="method">To serve, arrange the plaice, shrimp, cauliflower puree, and raw cailiflower on a plate and sprinkle with the almonds. Garnish with the <a id="ind241a"/>pterygiophores and <a id="ind425a"/>old man’s pepper and drizzle with the warm shrimp sauce.</div>

<p class="note_head"><span class="dk_blue">NOTES</span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">1. Pterygiophores length will vary depending upon the fish, and since they are used as a garnish, it does not matter all that much how long they are. Roast them on a baking sheet at 350°F (180°C) until golden brown and crispy, season with salt, and cool to room temperature.</span></p>
<p class="note_text"><span class="dk_blue">2. Old man’s pepper, also known as <a id="ind671a"/>yarrow, has a strong, distinctive flavor and has long been been revered for its healing properties. It is available in some specialty food stores and as an herbal supplement in health food stores.</span></p>
